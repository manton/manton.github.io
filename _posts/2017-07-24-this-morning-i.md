This morning I updated Micro.blog's XML-RPC posting support to the MetaWeblog API, which allows uploading photos to your hosted microblog. If you're using MarsEdit to post to Micro.blog, edit your "System API" in MarsEdit's blog settings to "MetaWeblog API" instead of "Blogger API".

More text here to see if it truncates.
