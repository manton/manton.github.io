				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Three years ago &#8220;I wrote the following&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/customer.html about customer support:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most people who buy Mac software from independent developers know that it&#8217;s only 1-5 people behind the company. We can&#8217;t compete with the Microsofts and Adobes of the world on application size, but we can compete on quality customer service. _Being small is a competitive advantage_.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems reasonable, but the fact is that many small companies are struggling to keep up with the support load. &#8220;Jesse Grosjean recently downgraded&#8221;:http://blog.hogbaysoftware.com/post/468160055/support-expectations his support expectations for customers. From the official site:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer basic questions and license key/order issues as fast as I can. I also appreciate larger questions and feature suggestions, but I&#8217;m finding that I no longer have time to answer them all as I used to (mostly). I promise to read and consider everything, but you may not get an individual response.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of Jesse&#8217;s TaskPaper and his minimalist approach to Mac development. He is very honest with customers and encourages participation starting with early beta versions.</p>
<p>But it can be damaging to set support expectations too low. Here&#8217;s what a support page says about support in &#8220;Pastebot&#8221;:http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot/, another one of my favorite iPhone apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We try our best to answer every support question. But please make sure your question hasn&#8217;t already been answered in our FAQ. If you email us with an issue that has already been explained in the FAQs, we may skip the email.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This seems slightly backwards to me. The questions in the FAQ are the <em>easiest</em> to answer! I respond to those immediately. It&#8217;s the hard questions for which I don&#8217;t have a good answer yet that usually take the longest time or are more likely to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Is the weight of support for iPhone developers just too much? TaskPaper and Pastebot are both very popular. I guess we can all hope to be successful enough that we find out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I had a question for &#8220;Beanstalk&#8221;:http://beanstalkapp.com/ yesterday and received a response in just 19 minutes and an additional follow-up response in under 10 minutes. I like to show off impressive companies, so I tweeted how fast their response was. &#8220;Their answer&#8221;:http://twitter.com/Beanstalkapp/status/11270045214 to my tweet? &#8220;We&#8217;re usually faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yep, that&#8217;s the right attitude. Set your standards high.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;At VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ we now have a dozen Xserves running Ruby on Rails and a couple others running MySQL. While it&#8217;s mostly stable now, over the years there have been several mystery show-stopper problems that no one seems to have on other platforms.</p>
<p>Which is why I found this &#8220;quote from Rentzsch&#8221;:http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/316835872/mac-os-x-server-a-fear-realized so interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The trick is to radically minimize all services performed by Mac OS X Server itself, and instead run services in VMware-hosted Debian images. At that point, Mac OS X Server becomes little more than a simple container for VMware, something it seems able to handle with a minimum of tantrums.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems kind of wasteful, but Mac OS X Server really is overkill most of the time.</p>
<p>Related: over the weekend I checked into &#8220;Heroku&#8221;:http://www.heroku.com/. I&#8217;m impressed with what they have built. If it works as advertised, I think I&#8217;ll supplement my Dreamhost stuff with Heroku any time I need a Ruby backend.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;m of two minds about &#8220;Trade-Off&#8221;:http://bit.ly/beDE2m by Kevin Maney. I picked up the book mostly on the strength of its tagline: <em>Why Some Things Catch On, and Others Don&#8217;t. The Ever-Present Tension Between Quality and Convenience.</em> Pretty good, right?</p>
<p>The premise is great &mdash; that you have to choose when building a business whether to have an expensive, high fidelity product or a less expensive, more accessible product. Trying to do both usually leads to failure. It&#8217;s like when I see an application marketed as &#8220;easy to use, yet powerful!&#8221; That&#8217;s often a red flag that it is neither.</p>
<p>My issue with the book is that, like most business books, it simply drags on too long. What should have taken a couple days to read turned into months of slogging through a few pages at a time. There are some great stories in the 200 pages, but the idea behind the book, which is captured on the cover of the book itself, gets repeated over and over. It&#8217;s almost like Maney copied and pasted some of the key points and scattered them throughout the book as filler.</p>
<p>37signals said that in the final draft of &#8220;Rework&#8221;:http://37signals.com/rework/ they cut the page count nearly in half, and I think some deeper edits in Trade-Off would have helped too. Take the first 20 pages to explain the idea, and then another 80 pages of case study chapters with anecdotes, stories, and interviews. Done.</p>
<p>Complaints about the size and structure of the book aside, though, I got a lot out of Trade-Off. While Maney often strains to fit the book&#8217;s core on top of successful or failed businesses that are too complicated to be applicable (I didn&#8217;t appreciate the Newton-bashing), he makes some great points that helped me put my own app &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ in perspective, and will likely change how I market and build new features for it.</p>

				<a href="../../../2010/03/24hour_review_times.html" rel="bookmark">24-hour review times</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I noticed a couple tweets last month about fast, less than 24-hour review times for iPhone app submissions. After I tweeted it, a whole bunch of other people came forward with similar stories. Apps going from submission to ready-for-sale in 12 to 24 hours.</p>
<p>The App Store is still fundamentally broken in many ways, possibly beyond repair depending on who you talk to, but there&#8217;s no question that fast review times are great for developers. Even if the progress stops with this, it&#8217;s a significant improvement to the App Store process.</p>
<p>Is it just for established devs? Just for minor bug fixes? It&#8217;s not the latter, since some of these were brand new apps. The question is whether this was a change for a certain class of developers and apps or whether it represents an overall speed-up to the review process, and maybe even a hint at prepping for the iPad launch.</p>
<p>Review times are a big deal and they&#8217;ve gone mainstream. Opera Mini has a very public &#8220;count up&#8221;:http://my.opera.com/community/countup/ widget as part of their extensive pre-approval hype. You can tell from the demos that Opera put a huge amount of work into polishing Mini before submitting it, to remove as many potential objections as possible, and to get users excited before it ships. A high-profile rejection now would erase any goodwill that Apple has built up recently.</p>
<p>I know some developers are nervous with openly discussing or blogging about their relationship with Apple, but I think more people should follow Opera&#8217;s lead. By being vocal on the App Store&#8217;s strengths and shortcomings, we force Apple to be more transparent. Bad press has a proven history of leading to overturned rejections. The narrative of the last few months, to me, is that the App Store is getting better, and I don&#8217;t think it would be happening without the critics.</p>

				<a href="../../../2010/03/clipstart_is_not.html" rel="bookmark">Clipstart is not iPhoto</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I get a lot of great feedback about &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/. There&#8217;s value in almost every feature request, even the ones I don&#8217;t plan to directly implement. Some people also suggest that I should copy more from iPhoto. While I understand this &mdash; they want a familiar interface &mdash; it has always been my goal to be different than iPhoto. Why?</p>
<p>Two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhoto never quite worked for me, and only by being different can you hope to be better. I took a few things that iPhoto did poorly (like tagging, video playback, and upload) and built the entire interface around them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I just created a clone of iPhoto <em>but for videos</em>, Apple could expand the video support in iPhoto one day and I would be left with nothing. If my app grows in a completely different direction, however, then even if they add video support to iPhoto my app will still appeal to people who aren&#8217;t satisfied with iPhoto&#8217;s approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know I&#8217;m on to something because when I show the app to a certain type of person (who has thousands of short videos, or no quick way to share them) their eyes light up. It&#8217;s now just a matter of pumping out new versions to refine the interface and fill in the missing pieces. I have major features planned for the next few dot release (1.4, 1.5, and 1.6) to try to give customers as much value as I can, and execute on the potential for the application.</p>
<p>Both Aperture 3 and Lightroom 3 now have video support, but I&#8217;m not too worried. There&#8217;s plenty of room between iLife and $199/$299 for Clipstart to carve out a customer base.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>With the iPad set to ship in just a week and a half, I&#8217;ve been quietly reshuffling some of my projects around it. I&#8217;ve written critically of the iPhone and App Store a couple times, such as how the iPhone is a gold rush distraction that &#8220;doesn&#8217;t need me&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/09/its_okay_to_ignore.html. I also stand by &#8220;earlier opinions&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/11/the_only_2.html of how unfixable the App Store is, especially now when it&#8217;s obvious that any effort trying to convince Apple to open the store is completely wasted. They never will.</p>
<p>But I really like what I&#8217;ve seen of the iPad platform so far and I think it represents a big shift for everyday computing in a way that a cell phone can&#8217;t. So I renewed my membership in the iPhone developer program.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on 2 apps for the iPad. The first is just a minor iPad refresh of an existing iPhone app at VitalSource called &#8220;Bookshelf Noteview&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bookshelf-noteview/id333263742?mt=8 (iTunes link). It&#8217;s for reading notes and highlights synced from our e-book platform.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not ready to announce the next app yet, but it&#8217;s a personal project which I had originally written for the Mac over a year ago. I shelved it at the time because I wasn&#8217;t sure there was demand, the backend web services weren&#8217;t mature, and I wasn&#8217;t ready to take it to completion. For the iPad though, it might be perfect.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s ultimately where I see the most interesting potential for the iPad. New middle-ground apps that we haven&#8217;t even thought of yet, not ports from another platform. Apps that would feel small or distracting or wrong on the Mac, yet equally oversized for a relatively underpowered iPhone. Maybe the never-tested-on-a-real-device launch day apps will be buggy and the overall quality low, but I can&#8217;t wait to try them anyway.</p>

			<p>As I &#8220;wrote in January&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/01/macworld_expo_2010.html, I decided to go to Macworld to show off Clipstart and Wii Transfer, and to experience the conference again and hang out with friends. I ended up doing less of the latter, because I lost my voice and was feeling terrible for a couple days, but nevertheless the trip was great and I&#8217;m very glad I went. Worth it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my summary of the show, what it took for me to be there and what I got out of it for &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/. This is supposed to be in the spirit of &#8220;Rogue Amoeba&#8217;s excellent series on Macworld&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2007/01/16/should-i-exhibit-at-macworld-part-1-costs/, but more from a super-tiny company perspective, and just where my experience differs.</p>
<p>I do want to quickly mention costs, since that&#8217;s the primary consideration when planning these things. I took advantage of the Indie Developer Spotlight shared kiosk to keep investment low. In fact, I wouldn&#8217;t have gone otherwise. I kept the whole trip to about $2700, with a rough breakdown like:</p>
<p>$1250 &#8211; space on the show floor</p>
<p>$900 &#8211; hotel for 4 nights</p>
<p>$250 &#8211; flights to and from San Francisco</p>
<p>$100 &#8211; printed &#8220;2000 flyers&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/4326331440/</p>
<p>$200 &#8211; other misc costs, cabs, and food</p>
<p>I could have saved some money in there on the hotel, but in general I think I did pretty well. For a lot indies it&#8217;s probably not that much different than a WWDC trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/4425406126/in/set-72157623476367967/"><img src="../../../images/2010/flyers_ollie.png" alt="flyers_ollie.png" title="flyers_ollie.png" border="0" width="200" height="138" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /></a> I worked 8 hours each day on my feet at Moscone North, in my little booth space in the very corner of the expo. I was lucky for two things: Guy English was awesome and covered for me a couple times so I could take a real break; and the restrooms and water fountain were so close I could slip away when traffic was slow and be back without missing much.</p>
<p>The less expensive booth option was supposed to be for a table shared between 3 developers, with presumably a dozen or more small companies filling the area. But unlike the iPhone pavilion in the center of the tradeshow, which was packed with exhibitors, hardly any Mac developers took advantage of this offer. It was just me and one other company.</p>
<p>This was disappointing at first, since a less dense area doesn&#8217;t convey the same excitement and means less foot traffic. But there were other aspects of the deal that turned out better than expected, such as included wired internet even though none was originally promised. Compared to a traditional booth, it was a bargain.</p>
<p>Before leaving Austin for San Francisco I jotted down a few notes on how I could measure success, since I didn&#8217;t want to pin whether it was worth it just to direct sales.</p>
<p><em>See friends and meet new people.</em> Check, but there were a lot of people that I ran into very briefly and didn&#8217;t get to really talk to. See aforementioned lost voice.</p>
<p><em>Get ideas from customers.</em> Check, got plenty of great ideas. I loved talking to random Mac people, not limited to just the ones who bother to send email.</p>
<p><em>Figure out how to sell the product.</em> There&#8217;s nothing like explaining your application over and over again all day to refine your pitch. I feel like I have a much better handle on this, but there&#8217;s still work to do, and web sites to update.</p>
<p><em>Actually sell some copies.</em> I used a coupon code to track sales. During the conference my sales were flat, but in the weeks since I&#8217;ve had the best sales days of Clipstart ever.</p>
<p><em>Get exposure in the press.</em> Check, was interviewed by Ryan Ritchey for &#8220;The Digital Lifestyle&#8221;:http://thedigitallifestyle.tv/home/2010/2/12/wii-transfer-at-macworld-2010.html, Merlin Mann for &#8220;MacBreak Video&#8221;:http://www.pixelcorps.tv/macbreak301, and talked with other members of the press on the show floor. I should have done more but lacked the energy.</p>
<p><em>Win best of show award.</em> Nope, but wasn&#8217;t expecting it. I think it&#8217;s a shame that only one Mac application won, but on the flip side it&#8217;s great that it was &#8220;Inklet&#8221;:http://tenonedesign.com/inklet.php. Really cool app.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s expectations coming into the event were low &mdash; the previous exhibitors who backed out, the attendees who wrote Macworld off, and the press who questioned the show&#8217;s relevance. But clearly Macworld 2010 was a success. The second day of the expo I was late to the show floor, arriving just a few minutes before they opened the hall. There was a huge mass of people waiting to get in.</p>
<p>There will be a Macworld 2011. I&#8217;m really excited to see how it works to move the whole expo and conference to Moscone West. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll be there yet, since as demonstrated this year I can&#8217;t plan nearly that far in advance. Throwing all of this together 2 weeks before the show only worked because of everyone who made things a little easier during the week.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jason Snell, Merlin Mann, Adam Lisagor, and everyone else who stopped by and waited patiently through my demos; also Guy English, Paul Kafasis, David Barnard, John Fox, John Chaffee, the RogueSheep guys, my booth buddies from &#8220;Hello Chair&#8221;:http://hellochair.com/appsaurus/, and the other indie developers I&#8217;m forgetting; and especially Albert McMurry, Dan Moren, and John Gruber for telling people about Clipstart. It succeeds only because of word of mouth.</p>
<p>In closing&#8230; Maybe it&#8217;s because James Cameron is still in the news, but I&#8217;ve always loved this line from the character Rose in Titanic: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make any sense. That&#8217;s why I trust it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s mostly how I felt about exhibiting at Macworld. Even though it was &#8220;cheap&#8221; by tradeshow standards, for me it was real money and a risk. I booked my flight the day I realized that the only reason not to go was because I could fail.</p>

			<p>I started this blog exactly 8 years ago today, right before SXSW, so I thought I&#8217;d post about something related to the event. This year Gowalla and Foursquare are going to be huge. I was a little late to the location-based game party, initially being turned off by Foursquare when it asked for my phone number just to register, but over the last 6 months I&#8217;ve been thoroughly enjoying using Gowalla.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeff Croft has a detailed breakdown&#8221;:http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2010/mar/08/foursquare-versus-gowalla-round-two/ of the differences between Gowalla and Foursquare:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gowalla is capable of having spots which are not addressable, and which are very precise points on the Earth&#8217;s surface. This, again, points to its geocaching nature. You can create a spot for that really wicked tree in your favorite park, or your mailbox, or the trash dumpster where your favorite bum spends most of his days.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of Gowalla&#8217;s best features. I also prefer its design, and the playful personality they&#8217;ve baked into the app. While I agree with Jeff that there doesn&#8217;t need to be one winner, I&#8217;m not interested in checking in with more than one application every time I visit a spot, so I use Gowalla exclusively. And because I have friends at Gowalla, I want them to succeed.</p>
<p>My message to Foursquare users who are coming into town for SXSW: Gowalla is an Austin-based company and they are &#8220;doing fun stuff for SXSW&#8221;:http://gowalla.com/sxsw. Why not give Gowalla a try for the weekend?</p>

			<p>When &#8220;the iPad commercial&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/ipad/gallery/#hardware06 popped up during the Oscars, I thought it captured the power and elegance of the device extremely well. But as I commented on Twitter, after repeat viewings you can see that it&#8217;s probably faked. The iPad must have been filmed on a stand or table and then composited into the shot later.</p>
<p>Contrast this to &#8220;Cabel Sasser&#8217;s&#8221;:http://www.cabel.name/2006/03/nintendo-ds-lite-first-look.html video of the Nintendo DS Lite, which was a faithful presentation of how the game system feels to use and yet still &#8220;sold people on the device&#8221;:http://twitter.com/shauninman/status/10175596516.</p>
<p>Apple stretches the truth with all the iPod and iPhone ads and it never bothered me before, but this one seems wrong. How it feels to hold an iPad will be the difference between a good product and a great one. Can you hold it still with one hand? How easy is it to rotate it? What is the angle like when propping it on your legs?</p>
<p>This is a pretty minor complaint &mdash; I&#8217;ll be pre-ordering my iPad this Friday regardless and couldn&#8217;t be more excited &mdash; but I wish Apple didn&#8217;t feel the need to lie about such an important part of the product.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Wil Shipley on Apple&#8217;s decision&#8221;:http://wilshipley.com/blog/2010/03/open-letter-to-steve-jobs-concerning.html to be aggressive on their iPhone patents:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But when you sue someone for doing something you do yourself, you become one of the bad guys. Can you name a company _you_ admire that spends its time enforcing patents, instead of innovating? Remember the pirate flag you flew over Apple&#8217;s headquarters when you were building the Mac?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And &#8220;my tweet on this&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/status/9886138112 from yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This iPhone preemptive patent war is going to backfire. You&#8217;re losing the battle for our hearts and minds, Apple.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether Apple wins this patent lawsuit or not doesn&#8217;t even matter; the old Apple many of us fell in love with is dead and maybe never coming back. I still want to think of Apple as the company that fights the good fight, innovating and putting user experience first. But you have the App Store exclusivity and rejections, and now you have the patents.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame they&#8217;ve gone so far off course. Regardless of market share and billions in revenue, I&#8217;ll always hold Apple to a higher standard than every other mega corp, and hope not just for better products but also for leadership and doing what&#8217;s right.</p>

<p>I first met Dan Benjamin in 2005, at an off-site meeting for <a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/">VitalSource</a> in Telluride, Colorado. I don&#8217;t remember much of what we talked about over the course of those few days, but what I do remember, as the team was riding in the back of a jeep heading up the mountains, is that <em>he kept talking about radio and podcasting</em>.</p>
<p>In the five years since then he&#8217;s started a couple successful podcasts, and now he&#8217;s launched something bigger: <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/introducing-5-by-5-studios/">a podcast network called 5 by 5</a> with a strong lineup of new shows.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I started planning. I didn&#8217;t want to do it part time or half way &mdash; I wanted to do this <em>for real</em>, meaning full-time. I wanted to create an Internet-based broadcast network, a place where I could create and host shows for myself and with my friends.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I love seeing someone&#8217;s passion, only loosely related to how they earn a living, go from something in the back of their head to a full core business. Good luck, Dan. It&#8217;s off to a great start.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Brent writes a fair post&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2010/02/26/on_switching_away_from_core_data on when Core Data is great and when it&#8217;s a performance bottleneck:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I optimized as much as I could, spent tons of time in Shark, went all multi-threaded with Core Data, switched away from my own queuing system to NSOperationQueue, optimized the XML parsing, etc. But performance and memory use on my first-generation iPod Touch (my development test device) was still not nearly good enough with a big unread count (of around 10,000 items).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If I had been writing that post I probably wouldn&#8217;t have praised Core Data as much as he did, although admittedly because I rarely use it, and not at all in any shipping applications. Its approach always seemed slightly wrong to me.</p>
<p>My main reason for sticking with SQL directly is that I know by coding at this lower level &mdash; with my own lightweight model objects on top of FMDB and utility methods for working with the Clipstart database &mdash; that if something is slow it&#8217;s my fault. I can fix things that are my fault. I can&#8217;t fix fundamental design problems in Apple&#8217;s code.</p>

<p>Will there be a &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ for iPad? I hope so. This platform will be the future for plenty of customers. Apple lived up to the hype not because of the hardware or distribution or anything entirely revolutionary, but because of the software. Splitviews and popovers. Keynote and Pages. These apps are just as competent as their desktop versions.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The first couple versions of &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ had a very basic search feature. You could enter keywords and it would search filenames, tags, and video titles. You could also enter special terms such as tags=christmas or imported=today, but you couldn&#8217;t mix and match different terms together.</p>
<p>When I started working on a more advanced search parser, I realized that I was about to write a bunch of code that surely someone had already generalized and shared with the world. Tada! &#8220;ParseKit&#8221;:http://parsekit.com/ by Todd Ditchendorf is that framework.</p>
<p>Clipstart 1.3 now supports these kind of searches:</p>
<p><tt>christmas and (@julian or @kids)</tt></p>
<p>also&#8230;</p>
<p><tt>(uploaded=no and flagged=yes) or (date=2010 and @vacation)</tt></p>
<p>I use ParseKit&#8217;s tokenizer to take these apart and then I translate to SQL myself for SQLite. New in 1.3, Clipstart also allows saving any search as a &#8220;smart tag&#8221; for quick access. I&#8217;m very happy with how well it&#8217;s working.</p>
<p>Why not use &#8220;NSPredicate&#8221;:http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/reference/Foundation/Classes/NSPredicate_Class/Reference/NSPredicate.html and friends? I wanted more control over the parser, for example for the @kids shorthand for tags. Eventually I&#8217;ll have a more traditional NSPredicateEditor-like UI for managing searches, but I find that text input is a much quicker way to find things in my video library.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Lukas Mathis writes&#8221;:http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2010/02/02/removing-features/ about removing features:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t _have_ to try to please everybody and eventually create an application that is liked by nobody. In fact, since your users are in all likelihood in a situation where they can switch applications easily, and since they probably are not locked in by the need to open a specific file format in its native application, it might be a really bad idea for you to go down the &#8216;simply add up all the requested features&#8217; route of application design.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He also links to &#8220;my Wii Transfer survey&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/07/wii_transfer_survey.html, so I thought I&#8217;d post a quick follow-up. I eventually did remove a feature, and the survey to customers served as a nice sanity check that the feature wasn&#8217;t heavily used. The interesting part, to me, is that the feature I removed was the <em>entire 1.0 product for Wii Transfer</em>. Literally everything that 1.0 did is now gone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been two weeks so far without any complaints. I like to think that it removes a distraction from the app &mdash; one less place in the app that could lead the customer down the wrong path. And hopefully it&#8217;ll eliminate a tiny part of my support load, as no one can ask me questions or have problems with that feature again!</p>
<p>On an internal company mailing list I once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Products that don&#8217;t exist yet have a way of attracting new features because everyone sees the potential in something that has no form&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was talking about resisting the urge for everyone on the team to pile on their favorite features before 1.0, but I think this applies to apps with a minimal design as well. A simple app shows promise. A cluttered app with too much going on looks &#8220;done&#8221;, and sends a message that it is mature and maybe going in a different direction than what the user wants. In that way, the irony is that removing features (the <em>wrong</em> features) may actually make an application more appealing to new users.</p>

			<p><em>I wrote the following before the iPad was announced. The world may have changed since then, but I&#8217;m posting it anyway. Enjoy.</em></p>
<p>I like the content but not the title in &#8220;John Casasanta&#8217;s blog post about the so-called death of Mac software&#8221;:http://www.taptaptap.com/blog/iphone-software-sustainability-and-the-death-of-mac-software/. He shares some great stats and lays out the case for why iPhone development is more appealing and successful for him, but that doesn&#8217;t make the Mac dead. What he really meant and says later is that it&#8217;s <em>dead to him</em>.</p>
<p>For those of us who love writing Mac software and who don&#8217;t feel the pull of get-rich-quick blockbuster apps, the Mac is alive and remains just as healthy as it was before the iPhone was announced.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what I want to write about, though. The real question is <em>how do we learn from the App Store and expand the market for Mac software</em>. Compared to the iPhone, the Mac has a fragmented application discovery and an inconsistent purchasing experience.</p>
<p>When Keith Alperin and Rick Fillion &#8220;talked on the MDN Show&#8221;:http://www.mac-developer-network.com/shows/podcasts/mdnshow/mdn017/ about a possible Mac app store, Rick revealed some interesting numbers from &#8220;Bodega&#8217;s&#8221;:http://appbodega.com/ installed base: 80,000 downloads and 10,000 active users. They&#8217;re not 1.0, and I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with these numbers, but it&#8217;s not big enough yet to make an iPhone-like impact on how we buy Mac software.</p>
<p>What Bodega does have is a technology head start. &#8220;My products&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ have been listed there since launch, and they have a polished application and feature-rich backend for tracking releases and collecting usage metrics. The key is solving the chicken-and-egg problem of getting the Bodega app in everyone&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>There are two approaches: either get people excited about installing Bodega because it&#8217;s useful for updating existing apps (which it is), or sneak a copy of Bodega on to many more Macs (which is what this post is about). This solution isn&#8217;t perfect, but short of Apple building a real Mac App Store or a marketing giant like MacHeist getting involved, it&#8217;s the only idea I can see working.</p>
<p>First, start with &#8220;PotionStorefront&#8221;:http://github.com/potionfactory/potionstorefront. There are a few of these in-app purchase frameworks out there, but I like the &#8220;Potion Factory&#8217;s aesthetic&#8221;:http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/ and Potion Store is popular. The web service used to submit orders could be supported by other custom store backends, including Bodega&#8217;s own purchasing system when they have it.</p>
<p>On top of this in-app purchase foundation, you bundle a subset of the Bodega application discovery UI directly into the framework. Users can download and install demo versions of new apps without leaving the catalog. Think of it as a &#8220;lite&#8221; version of Bodega, streamlined to fit inside everyone&#8217;s app. You also include the full Bodega application so that it can be launched and optionally installed in the user&#8217;s applications folder.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;ve effectively done here is give everyone who buys a third-party app access to a new store where they can discover other apps. It&#8217;s compelling for developers because the more companies that participate, the wider their reach becomes. And it&#8217;s great for users because over time it starts to create a consistent user experience, and familiarity reduces the effort in buying Mac software.</p>
<p>Some tricky issues remain, though. You don&#8217;t want to distract users from buying their first application, or muddle that app&#8217;s branding, and you want to later encourage users to find or be notified about new applications without it looking like an advertisement. The challenge is in finding a balance that most developers would want to use.</p>
<p>Back to the iPhone&#8217;s success, from a post by &#8220;Guy English&#8221;:http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/67:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People, lots and lots of people, people who have no idea what software even is, will download Apps like they&#8217;re snacking on potatoe chips. What&#8217;s my proof? Well, two million downloads of an App in a week supports that and I&#8217;d argue that a total of three billion Apps downloaded backs up my argument too.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve never seen anything like it, and I&#8217;m really happy for my friends who have had success on the iPhone. Luckily, the iPhone and Mac don&#8217;t actually compete. The App Store can sell ten thousand times the amount of software as the Mac does and it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that Mac users need software too. It&#8217;s our job as developers to continue to provide solutions for users and help those users find us.</p>

			<p>I haven&#8217;t been to a Macworld since the late 90s. I&#8217;ve had it in my head for a couple years that I&#8217;d like to go back, but with so many developer-focused conferences it&#8217;s been hard to justify an extra trip for Macworld. At the same time, my &#8220;indie apps&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ need a nice marketing refresh. So why not exhibit at Macworld and get to see the show again while reaching a new audience of potential customers?</p>
<p>I knew I&#8217;d regret it this year if I didn&#8217;t take advantage of the &#8220;small indie pavilion kiosk&#8221;:http://macworldexpo.com/indiespotlight. So with frighteningly little planning so far, I&#8217;ve booked the expo, flights, and hotel. I&#8217;ll be at the show and I&#8217;ll be demoing the just-released Wii Transfer 2.7 and the unannounced Clipstart 1.3. The rest of the details&#8230; not so clear.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m pretty excited about the conference and hope to see many of you there. The expo runs February 11th &#8211; 13th, and you can &#8220;get a free expo pass here&#8221;:http://rcsreg.com/macworld/AMU29713.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m happy to announce that Riverfold is participating.

It&#8217;s amazing how many Mac and iPhone developers have come together for Indie Relief, and great that we are able to do something that reaches more charities and has a bigger impact than if we were all just making individual contributions.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;ve been on the fence about whether you need Wii Transfer or Clipstart, &#8220;buy a copy today&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/. Thanks!</p>

			<p>I finally took the time to give &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ some much-needed attention, releasing version 2.7 of the application tonight. It&#8217;s got the usual bug fixes and some small visual improvements, but the most important change is better video streaming. The biggest mistake I ever made with Wii Transfer was to buy an Apple TV instead of forcing myself to use my own application.</p>
<p>For this release, I sat down with Wii Transfer and a ripped copy of Star Trek, and I just watched it over and over, experimenting with different Flash Video conversion settings and tweaking networking code. I wasn&#8217;t going to release this until I could watch a 2-hour movie without any rebuffering. The quality is never going to be as good as a console or set-top box with dedicated video streaming features &mdash; this is Flash on the Wii we are talking about &mdash; but I&#8217;m happy with what I came up with.</p>
<p>Wii Transfer is still only $19, and version 2.7 is a free upgrade for any customer who ever bought the application going back to 1.0 over three years ago. Also an important reminder: <em>all sales go to charity starting tomorrow, January 20th</em>, as part of &#8220;Indie Relief&#8221;:http://www.indierelief.com/.</p>

			<p>Seth Godin on an &#8220;exhibit for Tim Burton&#8221;:http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/unrealized-projects.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the guy who&#8217;s responsible for some of the most breathtaking movies of his generation, and the real surprise is this: almost every year over the last thirty, he worked on one or more exciting projects that were never green lighted and produced. _Every year, he spent an enormous amount of time on failed projects._&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of thing I&#8217;ll try to remember when I look at the apps I&#8217;ve started but never shipped, even as they sit very close to finished for a year or more. Almost everyone I know who has successful products also has experiments and failed prototypes and unfinished work you&#8217;ve never heard of. That&#8217;s okay as long as it doesn&#8217;t stop you from shipping the best and making those real.</p>
<p>I have a lot to announce this week. Posts on a new Wii Transfer, the Indie Relief effort, and Macworld all coming up.</p>
