			<p>My post on free apps &#8220;was linked from Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/18/manton-app-store a few days ago. Tons of new traffic, but my site didn&#8217;t go down. Why? An ancient but reliable version of Movable Type spitting out static files, with just a tiny bit of PHP for &#8220;Mint stats&#8221;:http://haveamint.com/.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brent Simmons talks about this lost art&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs of publishing to static files instead of serving from a database:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an old technique, actually, but too rarely practiced. (Lots of weblogs in the &#8217;90s were rendered as files-on-disk. They were built from a database plus templates and scripts and uploaded to a server. We did a bunch of this when I worked with Dave Winer at UserLand Software.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more with Brent&#8217;s advice, and in fact I ran this blog on Radio Userland for its first couple of years. In addition to performance, static files are portable. I can pick up this site and move it anywhere. The old web is fragile, and as web sites age, being able to permanently host them somewhere cheap and stable is going to become a big deal.</p>
<p>I hope a modern equivalent to Movable Type emerges eventually. For now, I&#8217;m thankful that the only time I have to worry about a web site outage is when a Dreamhost sysadmin trips over a power cord.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Twitter recommended upgrading to OAuth <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/security_best_practices">&#8220;for optimal security&#8221;</a> and so developers don&#8217;t need to <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/announcements">&#8220;worry about the user changing their password&#8221;</a>. While I dislike APIs that break old clients, I saw mostly the good things about OAuth, framed around letting the user approve access to their own account.</p>
<p>Seven months ago, as Twitter was finishing the OAuth transition, &#8220;Buzz Andersen tweeted this&#8221;:http://twitter.com/buzz/statuses/21402358130:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Twitter isn&#8217;t just enforcing OAuth for technical reasons: it&#8217;s a way of taking control of the platform.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I got it at the time. Twitter was all about open APIs, right? They encouraged new clients, and the original Mac client Twitterrific had &#8220;brought a lot of innovation and standards&#8221;:http://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/ to the platform. Why would they need this level of control?</p>
<p>&#8220;The email from Ryan Sarver&#8221;:http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a/7dd46c26157c9e29 last week showed part of how Twitter is changing as a company, refocusing from building a network to selling a product. Reading between the lines, it seems that to effectively sell ads, Twitter feels they need to control the user experience. On Twitter clients:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Developers have told us that they&#8217;d like more guidance from us about the best opportunities to build on Twitter. More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The answer is no.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Disappointing. At a panel on the Twitter API at SXSW, that sadly no one from Twitter in Austin knew about, the mood was pretty dim. I said to the room that we expected more from Twitter.</p>
<p>Then over the weekend, Ryan clarified: &#8220;we are saying it&#8217;s not a good business to be in but we aren&#8217;t shutting them off or telling devs they can&#8217;t build them.&#8221; There&#8217;s still plenty of uncertainty, but that&#8217;s a more hopeful message. I collected some additional &#8220;related tweets on tweetlibrary.com&#8221;:http://tweetlibrary.com/manton/twitterapirules.</p>
<p>Many people during SXSW asked me what this means for Tweet Library. Is Tweet Library a mainstream Twitter client? It has all the basic features of a normal client, but no, not really. It&#8217;s meant to be something more, something unique that solves problems no one else is working on, least of all Twitter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little discouraged, but not enough to stop. I owe it to my customers to finish what I started: to fix bugs, add new features, polish the rough edges, and make Tweet Library the best app on the Twitter platform.</p>

			<p>Jens Alfke, &#8220;commenting on the new Rdio API&#8221;:http://jens.mooseyard.com/2011/03/dudes-this-is-so-not-rest/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Maybe we should just give up on the term REST, since it&#8217;s become so diluted as to mean nothing more than &#8216;HTTP API that&#8217;s not as hard to use as SOAP&#8217;?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds right. &#8220;Pure REST&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer was never strictly followed, and the advantage to consistent HTTP methods &mdash; being able to abstract parts of the client details away, as with &#8220;ActiveResource&#8221;:http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveResource/Base.html &mdash; don&#8217;t seem like significant savings to me. Now that XML-RPC and SOAP are mostly dead, we assume that new APIs are going to be usable from any language without much effort. I won&#8217;t object to having one less acronym in the world.</p>

			<p>Today is the 9th anniversary of this blog. Once a year I dig through old posts, remembering what the industry was like and the topics I was interested in. This time I found a link to a post Evan Williams wrote in 2001 as Pyra Labs and Blogger were struggling:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;First of all, the company (Pyra) is not dead, and the service (Blogger) is not going away. However: We are out of money, and I have lost my team.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yes, things would have been very, very different if the Internet Bubble wouldn&#8217;t have burst and we were still in that&#8230;that, Other World in which we started. In that world, things that seem dumb now (such as launching a product and letting it grow for so long without making revenue from it a priority) made sense.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The full text is &#8220;available on the Wayback Machine&#8221;:http://replay.waybackmachine.org/200102040700/http://www.evhead.com/longer/2200706_essays.asp. I wish more CEOs blogged with even half the sincerity.</p>
<p>SXSW Interactive starts this weekend. When Evan wrote the above, the conference was a few rooms along a single hallway. Now it&#8217;s a monster conference, spread across multiple venues, with a speaker database so dense I don&#8217;t even know where to start. Still, I&#8217;ll be there and hope to catch up with any of y&#8217;all making it to Austin.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;John Gruber has a solid summary&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2011/03/dirty_percent of the issues around in-app purchase. Regarding the closed platform:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;iOS isn&#8217;t and never was an open computer system. It&#8217;s a closed, controlled console system &mdash; more akin to Playstation or Wii or Xbox than to Mac OS X or Windows. It is, in Apple&#8217;s view, a privilege to have a native iOS app.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the root of nearly every strength and problem with the App Store. I&#8217;ll never be happy about it. But in-app purchase restrictions are even more complicated than that. It started not just with the controlled environment but the decisions around free apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael Tsai points to this Peter Oppenheimer quote&#8221;:http://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/02/24/app-store-revenue-stream/ from late February that Apple runs the App Store at &#8220;just a little over breakeven&#8221;. I&#8217;ve argued that Apple&#8217;s 30% tax is about growing that to significant profit at the expense of developers, but in the back of my head I&#8217;ve also been concerned that maybe it&#8217;s just to keep the App Store from falling into the red. Maybe they are really struggling under the weight of what they created, and long app review times and lack of focus around the Mac App Store launch are just symptoms of that.</p>
<p>If this is true, then I&#8217;m more sympathetic to Apple&#8217;s predicament. They aren&#8217;t being greedy; they&#8217;re just trying not to lose money. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they didn&#8217;t make a mistake.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, announcing the App Store in March 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You know what price a lot of developers are going to pick? Free, right? So when a developer wants to distribute their app for free, there is no charge for free apps. At all. There&#8217;s no charge to the user, and there&#8217;s no charge to the developer. We&#8217;re going to pay for everything to get those apps out there for free. The developer and us have the same exact interest, which is to get as many apps out in front of as many iPhone users as possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I remember being surprised when I heard this. We take for granted now that much of the App Store&#8217;s success is because of free apps, but I&#8217;m not sure it had to be that way. The iTunes Music Store launched with a full paid catalog of music. Many of the hits in the App Store, like Angry Birds and Doodle Jump, have never been free.</p>
<p>But watching Steve Jobs from 2008, you can tell Apple was worried that what happened to the Mac (lack of third-party apps and games) might happen to the iPhone as well, so they gambled the profitability of the App Store away to encourage as many apps as possible. That was their choice.</p>
<p>Again, from Steve Jobs: &#8220;We keep 30% to pay for running the App Store.&#8221; Not a profit center. Not a business. Just to pay for running the store, so that the user experience for app discovery on the iPhone is second to none.</p>
<p>Today, we know that Apple has never planned well for free apps. You don&#8217;t need to look much further than their &#8220;reversal of allowing in-app purchase in free apps&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/143339/2009/10/appstorepurchasing.html to see that they are making this stuff up as they go along.</p>
<p>When Steve Jobs said it, offering free apps for so little seemed almost foolish, like Apple was compensating for the high 30% by giving <em>too</em> good a deal to free apps. Why not charge some hosting fee? Or why not give up exclusive distribution and let free apps be installed directly by the user without forcing everything through the App Store? Unlimited bandwidth, promotion in the store, and everything else just for the $99 dev program fee was a pretty good deal.</p>
<p>And now I wonder if Apple hasn&#8217;t been backpedaling ever since, trying to make up for that mistake: free apps are a burden. iAd was the first correction, because a share of revenue from free apps was going to Google instead of Apple. In-app purchase is the next correction, because real value can be delivered in a free app with transactions handled elsewhere.</p>
<p>Apple can&#8217;t accept a future in which too many apps are technically free &mdash; something that has already happened on Android &mdash; unless they are also taking a cut when money changes hands outside of app download.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matt Drance clearly spotted the loophole&#8221;:http://www.appleoutsider.com/2011/02/22/omgiapbbq/ that forces Apple to be so strict with in-app rules:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;30% to Apple across the board &mdash; app sales, IAP, and now subscriptions &mdash; is consistent, clear, and uncheatable. That cheating bit is significant: a 10% commission for subscriptions, for example, would see developers adopting the subscription system en masse so they could keep more money. Apps that were once $2.99 would suddenly be asking for installments like late-night infomercials.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple is trapped by their original decision to shoulder the cost of free apps. They encouraged free apps and now they&#8217;ve got one band-aid on top of another &mdash; advertisements, in-app purchase, subscriptions &mdash; all trying to make free apps work for the App Store bottom line. These changes make developers nervous because all the power lies with Apple.</p>
<p>Free apps and the problem of exclusive distribution are linked. Get rid of free apps, and the store can support itself naturally. Get rid of exclusive distribution, and Apple can be more creative about charging developers who do want to participate in the App Store. If Amazon isn&#8217;t happy with Apple&#8217;s terms, users can install the Kindle app outside the store and it doesn&#8217;t cost Apple anything to maintain.</p>
<p>Apple, want to charge 30%? Go for it. Want to make the submission rules more strict? Fine. Want to adjust how you run the App Store to reflect what&#8217;s happening in the market? No problem. Just give developers an out. We are going to be back here year after year with the latest controversy until exclusive app distribution is fixed.</p>

			<p>I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about the iPad 2. Yes, &#8220;most of it was expected&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/status/42597189645639680, but faster and more memory is exactly what the iPad needs. I&#8217;ll be getting it on day 1 and can&#8217;t wait to give Tweet Library a try on the new hardware.</p>
<p>During the announcement I collected 70 tweets that I thought captured the event. You can &#8220;view them on tweetlibrary.com&#8221;:http://tweetlibrary.com/manton/ipad2event.</p>
<p>Speaking of Tweet Library, Apple just approved version 1.2.2. It fixes a handful of bugs and adds a few new things, like block and report spam, for those of you using it as your main Twitter client. Check out the &#8220;full release notes&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/releasenotes/ or view it &#8220;in the App Store&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweet-library/id365768793?mt=8.</p>

			<p>I hadn&#8217;t yet read &#8220;Neven Mrgan&#8217;s post&#8221;:http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/3451376797/30 when I wrote &#8220;my own&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/02/30_of_the.html yesterday, but he strikes one of the same themes I closed with:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But with this 30% thing, the 30% I&#8217;m really interested in is, will Apple eventually see 30% of its revenue come from various cuts, percentages, deals, and obligations? If so, that means a different focus for the company &mdash; a focus on things and people farther removed from me and you. And that makes me a bit bummed out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, neither of us is filling in for Steve Jobs, and Apple <em>can</em> do anything they want within the law. But what Neven captures so well here is that many of us hold Apple to a higher standard because Apple has a history of creating great things. This 30% business model doesn&#8217;t seem to have any place in that history.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I believe the iPad is the future of mainstream computing, not just of mobile devices. That&#8217;s why I picked it as the first platform for Tweet Library. But forcing developers to use in-app purchase shows that Apple&#8217;s version of success for the iPad looks much different than mine.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s tight control over iOS has always been troubling. If there&#8217;s no way to install an app on the device without Apple&#8217;s approval, then Apple can make or break any business that builds for the platform. It&#8217;s an added risk for the thousands of tiny development shops for which the iPhone and iPad are otherwise perfect.</p>
<p>There was such huge growth in the development community because of iOS that I&#8217;m not sure anyone was paying attention to where we&#8217;d end up. We saw a new phone instead of the future of computing. We saw the gold rush but not the damage, so we let it happen. We let it happen by not sending Apple a clear message: total control over distribution is bad for developers and bad for users.</p>
<p>And now we&#8217;re letting Apple take 30% from every company that wants an iOS app to complement their business, whether it has anything to do with software development or not.</p>
<p>From &#8220;Matt Drance&#8221;:http://www.appleoutsider.com/2011/02/22/omgiapbbq/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Whatever the fine print says, Apple is no longer letting developers do things it had been letting them do &mdash; and build businesses on &mdash; for almost two years, and many developers are quite understandably upset about that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And &#8220;Marco Arment&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/3437484678:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A broad, vague, inconsistently applied, greedy, and unjustifiable rule doesn&#8217;t make developers want to embrace the platform.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope we&#8217;re wrong about the worst-case interpretation &mdash; I like &#8220;this Steve Jobs email&#8221;:http://www.macrumors.com/2011/02/21/steve-jobs-email-suggests-in-app-subscriptions-dont-apply-to-software-as-a-service/ much more than &#8220;the reality of Readability&#8217;s rejection&#8221;:http://blog.readability.com/2011/02/an-open-letter-to-apple/ &mdash; but because Apple fails so spectacularly at communication we won&#8217;t know for sure until more rejections come in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not comfortable with a future in which 30 cents on the dollar goes to a single company, no matter whether it&#8217;s from app downloads (where Apple offers hosting and discovery) or content sales and web service subscriptions (where Apple offers little). If the iPad grows like many of us expect it to, siphoning a third of the cash flow around <em>everyday computers</em> will create a completely different economic environment than exists today. It&#8217;s unprecedented.</p>
<p>And it would ruin Apple. Not the company&#8217;s finances, but its focus. John Gruber &#8220;wonders what he&#8217;s missing&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/02/21/readability, and this is it: Apple is embracing a model that is fine for Readability but runs counter to Apple&#8217;s core business. The iTunes Music Store wasn&#8217;t a business in its own right; it helped sell more iPods. The App Store shouldn&#8217;t be a huge revenue stream; it makes the iPhone and iPad better.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s strength has always been selling a great product to end users &mdash; &#8220;the rest of us&#8221;. The new Apple has fallen into the trap of thinking they should also be an advertising company and an overpriced payment processor. It&#8217;s a slippery slope from here to becoming just another mega-corp that has their hands in everything that can make money instead of &#8220;standing for something&#8221;:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oAB83Z1ydE.</p>

			<p>&#8220;John Chandler wrote a nice post&#8221;:http://www.byjohnchandler.com/2011/01/28/filter-friday/ on the filters he uses in various Twitter apps. Here&#8217;s a clever one for <em>&#8220;you missed it&#8221;</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I try to limit how many people I follow so I can read most of what they say. So, if they preface a tweet with something like &#8216;If you missed it,&#8217; or &#8216;In case you missed it,&#8217; I probably didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned in the comments, I have a few filters I like too, such as filtering out all old-style RTs. I even experimented with filtering out all hashtags. It&#8217;s great when I want to completely un-clutter the timeline of gimmicky tweets, but I can keep the filter toggled off when I have more time to read.</p>
<p>The advantage of how I built filters in &#8220;Tweet Library&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/ is that they are dynamic collections inside the app, kind of like smart playlists in iTunes. This means while it filters the junk out of my timeline, I can still occasionally go and review what it filtered out.</p>
<p>(I just submitted Tweet Library 1.2.1 to the App Store with a handful of bug fixes. Hopefully it&#8217;ll be approved soon.)</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>With the recent release of &#8220;The Daily&#8221;:http://www.thedaily.com/ and the news of &#8220;Sony&#8217;s e-book app rejection&#8221;:http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/02/change-in-apple-policy-has-e-book-fans-worried-about-their-apps.ars, there&#8217;s speculation that Apple will change the rules around iOS in-app purchases. The 30% cut makes it difficult for some businesses to move to the App Store without passing a cost increase on to customers.</p>
<p>Other than &#8220;no change&#8221;, I&#8217;ve only heard two possible solutions:</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Special deals for the big guys.</em> Amazon and other retailers could negotiate lower rates. But as Marco mentioned on &#8220;Build and Analyze&#8221;:http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/11, the App Store treats large and small developers as equals. It&#8217;s a real strength that a 2-person game company can compete with Electronic Arts. I hope we never lose that.</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Lower percentage for everyone.</em> Not going to happen. Take an app like Twitterrific. I consider it a $5 app, but to the store it&#8217;s actually a free app with a $5 in-app upgrade. Lowering the in-app cut would encourage many previously paid apps to convert to free and pay less to Apple.</p>
<p>This is why I believe the only option is for Apple to <em>distinguish between in-app content and features</em>. Content purchases, such as e-books or virtual game items, would be in one class of payment. Feature upgrades, such as unlocking core functionality in the app, would continue to be 30%, same as paid downloads.</p>
<p>Is it confusing for developers? Is it totally subjective and up to the judgement of the review team? Yes. Welcome to the App Store.</p>

			</h1>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The Mac App Store launched! Like many developers I spent the day taking it out for a spin, thinking about whether this changes everything, and trying to ignore the fact that my app Clipstart isn&#8217;t in the store on day 1 even though &#8220;I submitted to Apple 7 weeks ago&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/misc/clipstart_mas_history.png.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s talk about Apple&#8217;s 30% cut, because it&#8217;s been on my mind now that I have a real app in the iPad App Store. It&#8217;s easy to keep these discussions too vague to be meaningful &mdash; 2.9% + $0.30 for PayPal, 8.9% for FastSpring, 30% for Apple, who cares? &mdash; so it&#8217;s more illustrative to work with real numbers.</p>
<p>The massively-popular Camera+ from Tap Tap Tap &#8220;sold 78,000 copies on Christmas day&#8221;:http://www.macrumors.com/2010/12/28/camera-reaches-over-78000-sales-on-christmas-day-alone/, but no one else I know sees numbers like that. My own $10 Tweet Library fell a little short of 1000 copies in its first launch month&#8230; and unfortunately continued to drop since, but let&#8217;s use that to keep the math simple. Selling direct via PayPal would be $590 in fees. To Apple? About $3000.</p>
<p>Apple provides a unique service and it&#8217;s their right to charge whatever they want. Developers can choose to pay it or restrict development to more open platforms. I&#8217;m inclined to think the 30% is high but not unreasonable for everything Apple hopes to provide.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s where everything breaks down: for $3000 I expect someone at Apple to <em>tell me what the $%!# is going on</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just review times, or emails that go into the void, unanswered for days or weeks or ever. It&#8217;s that Apple isn&#8217;t able to communicate about the fundamental issues that will make or break businesses.</p>
<p>&bull; When is the Mac App Store launching? <em>No word</em> from Apple for months, and a press release went to news sites before developers got a heads-up.</p>
<p>&bull; Why has my Mac app been in review for over a month, right up to the very day before the Mac App Store launches? <em>No answer</em>, and nothing to do but wait.</p>
<p>&bull; Where was a beta version of the Mac App Store so that we could understand how it interacted with existing apps before it was too late? <em>Nowhere</em>.</p>
<p>&bull; Why didn&#8217;t we receive more &#8220;guidance on bundle IDs&#8221;:http://openradar.appspot.com/8838369, version numbers, and app naming, obvious questions that only Apple knew the answer to? <em>No clue</em>.</p>
<p>&bull; When will there be promo codes for the Mac App Store to give to the press or help transition customers to the store? <em>No idea</em>, might be never.</p>
<p>A year and a half ago &#8220;Craig Hockenberry wrote about paying extra&#8221;:http://furbo.org/2009/07/10/year-two/ for fast approvals and a better communication channel. It reflected in words how frustrated everyone was over long app review times. At the time, &#8220;I answered&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/07/999_hope.html that quality customer service from Apple is something all developers deserve, not just those with cash to burn.</p>
<p>But clearly it&#8217;s even worse than that. Apple isn&#8217;t currently capable of significantly improving how the App Store works for any price! The App Store does get better, but it does so at Apple&#8217;s own pace.</p>
<p>There are many great people at Apple. Individually I know they are passionate about making good products and helping developers succeed, but collectively it seems like no one person is running the show. The developer-facing side of the company needs to have the freedom to become more transparent, to work closely with the iTunes Connect support team when developers need an answer. Apple&#8217;s secrecy cripples their ability to have a positive relationship with developers.</p>
<p>So do I think the 30% cut is too much? No, not for a straight answer. That would be priceless.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Two new bundles were announced this week: &#8220;The Indie Mac Gift Pack&#8221;:https://indiemacgiftpack.com/ (6 great Mac apps for $60) and the &#8220;Fusion Ads Holiday Bundle&#8221;:https://fusionads.net/bundle/ (an assortment of web design-related apps, icons, and more for $79). I love apps in both of these bundles and recommend you check them out, buy what you need, or gift them to a friend. There&#8217;s a fear among many developers that a bundle can cheapen the healthy Mac software market, but both these bundles avoid that with a higher price and the feel of being put together carefully.</p>
<p>As a comparison, here&#8217;s a &#8220;Macworld article on holiday bundles from 2009&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/145005/2009/12/holiday_bundles.html. That collection seems kind of random despite several good apps in the list.</p>
<p>And sales for the Indie Mac Gift Pack are split evenly to the developers, so we know it&#8217;ll be a nice revenue boost for them during the holidays. From the FAQ:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey&#8230; you&#8217;re ripping these developers off, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;No&#8230; we ARE these developers. Our six small companies decided to band together and do a promotion, to see if it works for us. We&#8217;re splitting all the proceeds evenly. There&#8217;s no middleman here.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve never participated in a bundle, but after some of the &#8220;MacHeist controversy&#8221;:http://homepage.mac.com/simx/technonova/reports/from_the_mouths_of_developers.html I developed a set of rules that I run Riverfold promotions on. These are the easy things that I can always say &#8220;yes&#8221; to without much thought:</p>
<p><em>Coupons are great.</em> My coupons rarely expire and I don&#8217;t care if sites like &#8220;retailmenot.com&#8221;:http://www.retailmenot.com/ keep a list of them. Saving a few bucks might be the difference between someone buying my software and not.</p>
<p><em>Giving out software to bloggers is great.</em> Inspired by &#8220;Wil Shipley&#8217;s C4 talk&#8221;:http://www.viddler.com/explore/rentzsch/videos/4/, I&#8217;ve &#8220;blogged about this&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2008/04/wii_transfer_serial.html. Apple employees get free licenses too.</p>
<p><em>Small promotions are great.</em> I freely give out copies to small sites that want to give away licenses of my software to encourage people to post comments. I think readers interpret these (correctly) as software developers doing something generous for a small site, instead of the gut reaction when you see software listed on MacZot or MacUpdate Promo (&#8220;are sales so bad they had to sell their software for half price?&#8221;).</p>
<p><em>Charity is great</em>. I loved being a part of &#8220;Indie+Relief&#8221;:http://www.indierelief.com/, the Pan-Mass Challenge auctions, and other bundles that go directly to a cause. Just like smaller promotions, these are good for users (deals on software), good for developers (helps with marketing), good for charity (donated money), and good for the software market (these aren&#8217;t developers who are making a sacrifice because their sales aren&#8217;t doing well &mdash; it&#8217;s charity).</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve seen a bundle like the &#8220;Indie Mac Gift Pack&#8221;:https://indiemacgiftpack.com/, I think I can more clearly judge a unique bundle opportunity when it comes along. Does it minimize the middleman? Does it respect the individual apps as peers? Does it use the total bundle price to underscore the value of software rather than cheapen it? Then it&#8217;s probably a good deal for everyone.</p>

			<p>On &#8220;episode 35 of Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2010/11/episode-35-wrap-it-up-in-cocoa/ I mentioned attending the 360iDev conference, and we brought it up again on the next show while plugging 360MacDev. I had a great time at the conference and hope to attend another one in the future.</p>
<p>The best part was meeting all the iPhone developers who I&#8217;ve never crossed paths with, and catching up with others I&#8217;d only met briefly before. iPhone developers come from a mix of places, from old Mac developers to web developers to traditional mobile or game developers. While there&#8217;s a risk that having so many small regional conferences will fragment the community, this concentrated group of mostly iPhone-only developers made for a great few days of sessions and discussion.</p>
<p>And my main concern leading into the conference &mdash; that the hotel location would make it difficult for people to head downtown or see other parts of Austin &mdash; turned out to be mostly a non-issue. I had a great time hanging out with everyone in the evening, and hope some of you will be back for SXSW.</p>
<p>I used Tweet Library to &#8220;collect about 120 tweets from attendees&#8221;:http://www.tweetlibrary.com/manton/360idevaustin at the conference: reaction to sessions, quotes, speaker slide URLs, dinner out, and more. Capturing an event like this is why I built the app. What you had for dinner isn&#8217;t interesting by itself, but <em>in context</em> it is powerful because it tells a story.</p>

			<p>In an &#8220;interview with Kevin Hoctor on episode 5 of the iDeveloper Live podcast&#8221;:http://ideveloper.tv/shows, Scotty referenced my comment from Core Intuition that customers are so used to terrible support that they don&#8217;t mind a few days or even a week delay. I thought this was maybe taken out of context a little since we were talking about vacations, so I went back to listen to what I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most people are thrilled to get a response in a few days, maybe a week they&#8217;re still cool with it. They are used to sending support email to companies and not getting a response any time soon or maybe not at all in some cases.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course I didn&#8217;t mean I strive for week delays before a customer gets a response, but looking back I think Scotty&#8217;s interpretation was right: in a way this was a confession that I&#8217;ve fallen down when it comes to support. My response times for Tweet Library questions are still very good (usually same day), but it&#8217;s dragging for my other products. Even when I&#8217;m quick to respond to an initial email, difficult follow-up questions often won&#8217;t see an answer for some time. I&#8217;m just not as responsive as I was when I wrote &#8220;this blog post about good support in 2007&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/customer.html.</p>
<p>The worst part are the emails that fall through the cracks. They are on their 2nd or 3rd response to a problem that I don&#8217;t understand, or they&#8217;re waiting on a solution that isn&#8217;t ready, and months go by before I can pick up the thread again. I hate this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to use this opportunity to get back to where I should be: less than 24-hour response in all cases, for all products. I&#8217;m adding a &#8220;stats section to my support page&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/support/ to keep me in check, and I&#8217;ve seeded it with response times for the most recent support questions via email and forums. This will also give customers an idea of what to expect without an explicit promise from me.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;Marco Arment wrote an interesting piece&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/1432156914 on the Mac App Store shortly after it was announced. I was nodding my head in agreement for much of it, until I got to this part:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And if the Mac App Store is only populated by a subset of today&#8217;s Mac software, a few key points (such as &#8216;Inexpensive&#8217;) still won&#8217;t be true. This is why I believe that the Mac App Store will be dominated by (and become known for) apps that don&#8217;t exist on the Mac today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He makes great points, and I think his assumptions about Apple&#8217;s rules are correct. But newcomers dominating the store? And $1 apps as the second most popular price point on the Mac? I&#8217;m not convinced.</p>
<p>Many iPhone app hits lend themselves to a mobile environment, but the Mac is different because <em>people usually buy computers to get work done</em>. You don&#8217;t have your MacBook Pro with you while you&#8217;re waiting in line at the grocery store. You don&#8217;t have it at a party when your friend tells you about the latest game. You don&#8217;t hand your computer to your kids when they&#8217;re bored in the car and want to play Angry Birds.</p>
<p>If $1 apps will be so common on the Mac App Store, why aren&#8217;t they common on the iPad? In the iPad top 10 right now there are only two 99-cent apps. Prices around $2.99 or $4.99 are much more common, and there are plenty of $10 apps as well in the top paid and especially top grossing lists. The iPad app making the most money right now is a $20 music app called &#8220;djay&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think $10-$20 will be pretty common on the Mac App Store, but not $1, and not even $2 or $3. Something that&#8217;s priced so cheap sends a clear message on the Mac: this app is useless and should have been free.</p>
<p>As I said recently on &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/, I absolutely wish all the best of luck to iOS developers and designers moving to the Mac. I had a great time hanging out with a mostly iOS group at 360iDev last month; these guys are ambitious and smart and bring innovation to the platform because they don&#8217;t have the baggage that the rest of us have. 2011 will be a fantastic year for new Mac software and for indie developers!</p>
<p>But take a good look at some of your favorite apps for iPhone and iPad and you&#8217;ll see that for the most part they lack the depth to compete with established Mac software. The workhorses on your Mac &mdash; text editors, image editors, file transfer apps, version control clients, web site tools &mdash; won&#8217;t be knocked off by new competition easily.</p>
<p>Maybe 10.7 Lion will be a revolution, but when the Mac App Store first launches on 10.6 it&#8217;s going to contain familiar software at familiar prices.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Apple&#8217;s announcement yesterday of a Mac App Store is big news. As soon as the event was over, journalists reached out to developers to get feedback on what it means for existing Mac shops. Reading the variety of responses is fascinating to me, and I contributed some quotes for articles in &#8220;Macworld&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/155061/2010/10/developers_mac_app_store.html and &#8220;Cult of Mac&#8221;:http://www.cultofmac.com/mac-app-store-more-developer-reaction/65036. There&#8217;s also a &#8220;write-up on Ars&#8221;:http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/10/mac-app-store-boon-or-bust-for-developers.ars.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s &#8220;Wolf&#8217;s take on the guidelines&#8221;:http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/1369652253/mac-app-store:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My fellow Mac developers are laughing at the Mac App Store guidelines. They&#8217;re reporting that apps they&#8217;ve been shipping for years &mdash; a number of them Apple Design Award-winning &mdash; would be rejected from the Mac App Store. These are proven apps, beloved by their users. The current guidelines are clearly out-of-touch.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Every developer I&#8217;ve talked to uses at least some private APIs on the Mac, often to work around bugs or limitations in current APIs. It&#8217;s disappointing that the Mac App Store is shipping before 10.7, because 10.7 would be a good opportunity to find out why developers still need private APIs and bake support directly into the next version of Mac OS X to solve common issues.</p>
<p>Can you imagine such rock-solid apps as BBEdit or Transmit being rejected from the Mac App Store? It&#8217;s going to be a lonely launch day full of hasty iOS ports if Apple doesn&#8217;t show some common sense when approving Mac apps.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Before I released &#8220;Tweet Library&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/, I talked to everyone who would listen about the price. Several people suggested I go with a free app, but use in-app purchase to upgrade to the full version. Two apps that handle this well include &#8220;Twitterrific&#8221;:http://twitterrific.com/ and &#8220;SimpleNote&#8221;:http://simplenoteapp.com/. Countless games also take this approach.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the closest thing the App Store has to demos, but it comes at a cost: anyone can leave a 1-star &#8220;too expensive&#8221; review of your app without even upgrading to the full version. At that point they are not even rating the app they downloaded (a free, limited version that probably works just fine); they are simply commenting on a portion of the app they didn&#8217;t want to buy.</p>
<p>There are two ways to give me feedback about Tweet Library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email support, post to Twitter, or write on your blog about the software. This is free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave a review in the App Store. This is $9.99.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m very comfortable with this model. The quality of feedback I get in email is extremely high, whether the customer has bought the app or not, and the App Store reviews aren&#8217;t cluttered with pricing rants.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>If you purchased, tweeted, blogged about, rated, or mentioned <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> thank you. I&#8217;ve been very happy to see how well it is being received. I built this app because I wanted to do more with Twitter, but I didn&#8217;t really know until it was released if anyone else would care.</p>
<p>The truth is, I released it a tiny bit too early &mdash; there are a few annoying bugs that I&#8217;ll need to fix soon for 1.0.1 &mdash; but it was a long development cycle, and faced with getting burned out on a project the only thing I know how to do is ship it. Then I can use the reaction from real customers to tell me if I&#8217;m on the right track and where to go next.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already blogged about the pricing and <a href="../../../2010/09/next_generation.html">viability of third-party Twitter apps</a>, though I hadn&#8217;t officially announced the app yet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When Twitter for iPad shipped it jumped to the number 1 spot in free apps, but maybe you don&#8217;t have to compete directly with that. Maybe if you hold your ground somewhere in the top paid list, that&#8217;s enough to find an audience.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Tweet Library has only been out for 3 full days, and I don&#8217;t want to jinx it, but so far this theory is holding. The app went to #2 for top grossing iPad apps in social networking in the first day. I didn&#8217;t expect that, but at $10 I can see how it might happen. Then it also climbed to #2 in top paid iPad apps in the same category, and stayed there for a couple days before dropping to #3 as I write this. The only other Twitter apps in any of the top 10 lists for iPad are Twitter&#8217;s official app and TweetDeck, both free.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that because it kind of blows my mind a little: Tweet Library has been the best-selling iPad Twitter app since it was released.</p>
<p>How did I successfully ship an app in a crowded market at literally 2x the price of any other app? Two things:</p>
<p><em>Refuse to compete on price.</em> I felt so strongly about this that I was willing to launch and fail. If the App Store couldn&#8217;t support $10 Twitter apps, then I would bow out. I saw in <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/10/06/tweet-library-for-ipad-makes-twitter-useful/">a comment on TUAW</a> that someone would wait until the price lowered, but I hope to avoid the pricing gimmicks common to the App Store. There&#8217;s no intro price for Tweet Library, and the price is not going to change. I believe consistency is the best long-term plan for app pricing.</p>
<p><em>Market the app as something new first and yet another Twitter app second.</em> I believe the key to selling Tweet Library is to focus the marketing around what makes it special: archiving tweets, curating tweets, filtering tweets. Yes, you can also post to Twitter and see mentions or reply to DMs, but that is just the price to get in the door. Tweet Library doesn&#8217;t do those common tasks perfectly yet, but customers seem willing to cut me some slack because of all the other unique features that the app offers.</p>
<p>So, up next I&#8217;m going to fix bugs, and I&#8217;m going to add features, and I&#8217;m going to listen to customers. I&#8217;m sure it will soon drop out of the top 10 and other Twitter apps will take its place, but I feel like the launch was strong enough to prove that I&#8217;ve got something. I intend to carve out a little niche in the Twitter market and execute on it.</p>

			<p>I submitted my new iPad app to Apple earlier this week. It hasn&#8217;t been reviewed yet, but Ryan Irelan has been using the beta to curate a &#8220;collection of ExpressionEngine conference tweets over on the EE Insider blog&#8221;:http://eeinsider.com/blog/eeci-tweet-collection/. The app may still only be in the hands of my friends and beta testers, but it&#8217;s great to see how it could be used in the real world.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s one feature of the app: grouping tweets together around topics, events, conferences, categories, whatever, and then publishing them with one click so they can be shared with friends and indexed by Google. There&#8217;s more of course. I&#8217;ll be getting the marketing web site up soon, and a screencast too, hopefully before the app is approved! Although I&#8217;m quick to complain about App Store review delays, in this case I&#8217;m counting on a week delay so that I can get my act together.</p>

			<p>He snuck it in under a commentary on Alex Payne&#8217;s excellent &#8220;last post about Twitter&#8221;:http://al3x.net/2010/09/15/last-thing-about-twitter.html, but we now have a &#8220;Birdfeed postmortem of sorts from Buzz Andersen&#8221;:http://log.scifihifi.com/post/1144913920/in-a-way-the-twitter-platform-has-come-full. I&#8217;m particularly interested in where Buzz thinks the Twitter app market is going:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Does this mean that there&#8217;s no longer room for third party Twitter clients? My suspicion is that people will continue to make them, but it seems to me that they&#8217;re already on the road to becoming increasingly uniform and commoditized as the Twitter experience is more sharply defined by Twitter itself (as my Birdfeed collaborator Neven Mrgan has suggested to me, Twitter clients are going the way of email clients).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems nearly everyone thinks competing with Twitter&#8217;s official app is a bad idea. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Tapbots revealing Tweetbot&#8221;:http://tapbots.com/blog/business/say-hello-to-tweetbot shortly after the Tweetie acquisition:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But this news changes things for us. We probably won&#8217;t be able to charge for the app anymore. Who&#8217;s going to pay for a Twitter client when &#8216;Tweetie&#8217; is free?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the problem isn&#8217;t trying to build any Twitter app. The problem is building a <em>mainstream Twitter client</em>. The official iPhone and iPad apps, plus the redesigned web site, are so good that it&#8217;s futile to go head to head with them. You can&#8217;t undercut on price, and they are so well coded you&#8217;d need a talented full-time team to out-engineer them.</p>
<p>As I said in &#8220;my last Twitter post&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/09/next_generation.html, the trick is to look past the API. What would I want Twitter to add to the platform if I had my way? Design an app around that and you might have something interesting.</p>
<p>The theme in Buzz&#8217;s post that resonated the strongest with me is the emotional drain that building an app like this can have. The competition is intense. There&#8217;s a feeling that if you don&#8217;t have every little feature when you ship, you&#8217;ll be laughed out of the App Store. That is certainly on my mind, especially as &#8220;I intend to push the price&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/06/10_ipad_apps.html in this market, and even with beta feedback I&#8217;m still not sure how my app is going to be received in the real world.</p>
