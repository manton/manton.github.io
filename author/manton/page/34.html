				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/08/beats">John Gruber asks</a>, on the rumor that Apple will acquire Beats:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The Beats streaming service is interesting, but can’t Apple do that on its own, as an expansion of the iTunes Music Store and iTunes Radio?”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately I think the answer is no, Apple can’t easily do anything like what Beats Music has done. Not because they lack the skill, but because they lack the desire to actually do the work and hire the staff to make it happen. Compare iTunes Radio side by side with Beats Music. Beats Music isn’t just a streaming service; it’s more like a platform for curating playlists and discovering music.</p>
<p>I like Beats Music so much that I wrote two posts recently about it. Here’s a snippet from each, first on <a href="../../../2014/02/we_love_music.html">building something you love</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “iTunes Radio looks like something they felt they had to build, not something they wanted to build. Beats Music is in a completely different league, with a deep set of features and content. It looks like an app that’s had years to mature, not a 1.0.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And then on <a href="http://manton.org/2014/02/ending_the_app_store.html">ending the top 200</a> by doubling down on featured apps, just as Beats Music has done for music curation:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “How would this fix the junk problem in the App Store? Simple. No one in their right mind would ever feature one of these ad-filled, ‘re-skinned’ cheap apps. Great recommendations mean less reliance on search, making scam apps more difficult to find by accident.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>However, I agree with Gruber that on the surface this potential acquisition doesn’t really seem Apple-like. It would be unusual for them to acquire a high-profile brand. As much as I’d love to see the Beats Music team join Apple to improve iTunes and the App Store, I’ll be a little surprised if it actually happens. Maybe they have something else in mind that we can’t see yet.</p>

				<a href="../../../2014/05/sunlit_12.html" rel="bookmark">Sunlit 1.2</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Sunlit version 1.2 is <a href="http://taps.io/Ld3g">now available in the App Store</a>. It includes a few minor improvements and one major change: you can now use the app with only a Flickr account. It no longer requires App.net.</p>
<p>We hope this will allow more people to try the app. At any time, you can always add your App.net account to the app’s settings and it will unlock the more advanced features: syncing, sharing stories to other App.net users, and multi-user collaboration so that anyone can add photos and edit text in a story.</p>
<p>Making App.net optional instead of required meant rethinking what the minimum features were that all users should have. Obviously you have to be able to create stories, add photos, include text descriptions, and use filters. But we also kept coming back to one thing: we could not ship without also supporting web publishing. The bulk of work on Sunlit 1.2 was creating a parallel implementation for publishing that would seamlessly work with exactly the same UI, with or without App.net.</p>
<p>Some people may ask why we chose Flickr instead of creating our own user accounts system, or simply having no registration. To support publishing, it helps to have some unique username for a user, and a secure way to authenticate them on the server. It won’t surprise anyone to hear that <em>a lot</em> of people have Yahoo accounts. With a redesigned web and mobile experience, plus 1 TB of free photo storage, Yahoo’s giving Flickr something of a new resurgence. There’s a lot we could build on the Flickr API.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sunlit’s App.net support is a powerful differentiator and we’ll continue to improve it. It lets you own your data, share it with other apps like Ohai, and sync to multiple users. I still believe in the App.net API and user community; it’s too good a platform to give up on.</p>

			<p>Last week, in <a href="../../../2014/04/write_locally_mirror.html">my post about mirroring content</a>, I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “When we get into the groove of using a new service for a few years, it’s easy to forget that web sites don’t have a very good track record.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we find out that <a href="http://mlkshk.typepad.com/mlkshk/2014/04/goodbye.html">Mlkshk is shutting down</a>. They are working <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/463436494364213249">with the Internet Archive</a> to make sure the content is preserved, and they might still find a buyer for the whole service, but as things stand it’s likely that every link to Mlkshk-hosted images will break in September.</p>
<p>Mlkshk hasn’t been on my radar lately, but it was widely used enough a couple years ago that I added support for its image thumbnails to <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>. I hope they can at least find a solution to keep mlkshk.com working as a static site.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/05/07/manton-adn-api">Marco Arment responds</a> to my comment that developers should have seen the potential of the App.net API as something much bigger than Twitter. I wanted <a href="../../../2014/05/appnet_niche.html">my post</a> to be short, but Marco makes good points that are worth following up on. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Building an app on someone else’s API, rather than making your own, is a huge risk: it usually only pays off if the service provides a huge existing userbase and hard-to-duplicate functionality. App.net never offered either. They started out facing the typical social-network chicken-and-egg problem, put a huge paywall in front to prevent any growth, and tried to alleviate that by adding more chicken-and-egg problems to their offerings.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Building entirely on App.net for <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> was indeed a huge risk, and one that we expected would take time to pay off. It was a bet on the future. We are incredibly proud of our app and the response it got in the App.net community, but our goal was always to make an app <a href="../../../2014/01/no_coincidence.html">that appealed to everyone</a>, not just a small niche of tech folks. We’ve actually been working for over a month on a new version of Sunlit that expands the reach of the app beyond App.net, and coincidentally it just went into review at Apple this week.</p>
<p>But I think the chicken-and-egg problem was solvable. The main issue with iOS apps is that they couldn’t sign up a new user directly in the app. This made sense when App.net was a paid-only service, because you’d run into in-app purchase issues with Apple, but it became more technically feasible when the free tier launched.</p>
<p>The App.net founders also seemed receptive to the idea. There just wasn’t time to make it happen. I believe this single roadblock prevented any potentially-mainstream <a href="../../../2013/08/waiting_for_appnets.html">killer apps</a> built on App.net from getting off the ground. If it’s not easy to open a third-party app, create an account, and start using the service, too many people will give up. (Our numbers showed that only 40% of Sunlit downloads actually signed in to use the app for real.)</p>
<p>However, building our own backend for the app would also be very challenging and expensive. We are not syncing small bits of data around. It’s a photo sharing app, so right off the bat you’ve got big files that have to be hosted somewhere. On top of that there’s collaboration features, so you need not just user accounts but private sync channels that have specific read/write access to certain users. Plus all the metadata and formats to support syncing text, photos, and location check-in information. Not to mention publishing HTML, thumbnails, and maps. It’s daunting.</p>
<p>(In fact, it’s so daunting, I don’t think there’s a single app in the App Store that has feature-parity with Sunlit. The app simply could not have been built by a tiny team of 2 part-time developers if building a whole backend infrastructure first was a prerequisite.)</p>
<p>Marco closes with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “As much as App.net wanted to be — and eventually was — much more than a Twitter clone, it got the vast majority of its initial funding, enthusiasm, and developer support from people’s anger at Twitter’s dickification. But internet outrage doesn’t last long. Since App.net never became the new primary place where our friends all hung out, most of us never left Twitter — we all just accept that they’re dicks now, and we forgot about App.net.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s an argument to be made that App.net’s core mistake was building the Alpha web interface only far enough to match Twitter’s features and then moving on to other things. Instead, they could have kept improving Alpha until it was significantly better than Twitter, so good that it couldn’t be ignored. By doing so, maybe they would have also more effectively demonstrated the power of the API underneath.</p>
<p>I assume that App.net chose not to do this so they wouldn’t compete with developers. After all, the service was founded on the idea that developers should be respected and given every opportunity to succeed. Finding the right balance to showcase the platform with first-party apps without stepping on developers is not always easy. We can argue about which missteps were the most costly, but the founders never wavered on their original principles and they promoted every app that launched on the platform. That means something.</p>
<p>As for outrage not lasting long on the internet, Marco’s totally right. I just <a href="../../../2014/05/would_i_go_back.html">don’t forget that easily</a>.</p>

			<p>Justin Williams covers several aspects of this week’s App.net news, <a href="http://carpeaqua.com/2014/05/06/lessons-from-app-net/">comparing it to his own Glassboard service</a>. On finding a profitable niche:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Finding an audience of people interested in your platform is challenging. This isn’t Field of Dreams where if you build it people will magically appear. Once you find that niche of users, you’ve got to ensure they’re also the type of folks that are willing to pay to support your platform. If they aren’t, you keep looking for a niche that will sustain your product.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He also hits on the main thing that was probably holding App.net back: the stigma that it was just a Twitter clone. I’m more than a little disappointed that fellow developers didn’t get the power of the App.net API. Does <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> <em>look</em> like a Twitter app? Give me a break. App.net is hands down the best API of its kind.</p>
<p>So now we figure out what’s next. In the short term, not much changes. Tomorrow I’ll read my App.net timeline, make a few posts, reply and star as usual. Next week I’ll do the same. At WWDC I’ll use App.net messaging apps to coordinate meeting up with friends.</p>
<p>There’s no shame in shooting for the stars and missing. I’m thankful that even as the founders tried a few things outside micro-blogging over the last year, they never compromised on their original mission for the service. They never sold out users or developers, and the servers hum along in testament to that fact, as if nothing that’s good will ever really change.</p>

			<p>Before <a href="http://www.revolution60.com/page2/index.php?id=84850310691">some of the recent discussion</a> about the future of App.net, <a href="https://alpha.app.net/walruscp/post/25988120">Colin Pekruhn asked a question</a>, directed at Ben Brooks and me, about whether we’d go back to Twitter if App.net failed. My answer (and his) was a very clear “no”. Here’s what I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I’m very stubborn and not going to reverse my decision on Twitter. If ADN fails I’ll blog more.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The stubbornness deserves a little more explanation. Because programmers are pretty opinionated folks. When we feel strongly about an approach — to languages, to UI design, to backend architectures, anything — we’ll plant our feet in the ground and argue with coworkers about the right way to do things. And it’s easy to dig in, start coming up with more justifications for a choice before taking a second look and seeing if it’s actually the right thing, or whether we’re just fighting for something because we want to get our way.</p>
<p>I put a lot of thought into no longer posting to Twitter. I often bring up my low Twitter user ID (#897) because I think it helps underscore that I’ve been on the service a long time. I get the history of it. I was there when it was all done over SMS with my dumb Nokia phone. I had fun with early experiments on the platform, like my sadly abandoned <a href="http://story140.com/">@story140 account</a>, my <a href="http://wiitransfer.com/codes/">@wii codes service</a>, the <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker API</a>, and of course the two products I continue to support to this day: <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>.</p>
<p>I stopped posting because at some point the anti-developer attitude at Twitter became too much. The limits on user auth tokens, which have already killed a few popular third-party Twitter apps; the problems with shutting down IFTTT recipes; the guidelines that restricted how you could use your own tweets. This is all fairly well documented and I’ve written about it before. I leave my personal account silent as a small protest.</p>
<p>I knew leaving would be difficult, so I set up a series of posts to discourage my future self from ever joining again. <a href="http://watermark.io/collections/manton/myfinaltweets">My final tweets</a> were timed to go out on the anniversary of Steve Jobs’s death. They’re a collected moment, a tribute to both Steve and how great Twitter could be. I like that they’re forever pinned at the top of my profile page.</p>
<p>The best programmers aren’t so proud that they won’t admit when they’re wrong. There’s a time to fight for what you believe in — your coworkers don’t agree with how you want to build that feature, but maybe they just don’t see it clearly yet — and there is a time to admit you made the wrong call and move on. Saying “I was wrong, let’s do it your way” is a powerful statement and moves a project forward. I never want to ignore Twitter just because I’m so stubborn I refuse to admit I overreacted and that it’s time to crawl back to Twitter and accept defeat.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: <em>I wasn’t wrong</em>. Every reason I gave above for leaving Twitter is still valid. I have friends at Twitter doing great work — it’s truly incredible what they’ve built, from scaling the backend to how the iOS app works — but Twitter is too big and successful to change now. We can’t rewind the clock to when Twitter was a tiny company that cared more about developers than advertisers, so I won’t be back.</p>

			<p>135 episodes already? Hard to believe. But we’ve been pretty consistently putting out weekly shows for a while now. Funny thing about starting early and just sitting down to do work every day or week: eventually you <a href="../../../2008/10/slowgrowing_trees.html">end up with something big</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2014/04/episode-135-an-unfair-advantage-in-a-good-way/">this week’s show</a>, Daniel and I talked about Apple’s stock, rumors of a search engine, and a follow-up on my Twitter ads experiment. I like how this episode turned out.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Right after publishing <a href="../../../2014/04/write_locally_mirror.html">yesterday’s post on mirroring content</a>, I added a link to IndieWebCamp’s <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE</a>, a project from Tantek Çelik to provide a framework for mirroring posts to different services. It looks like that group is doing great work to identify microformats that will make this a more open standard.</p>
<p>Noah Read also rolled his own solution for writing posts on his site first and then letting them flow to Twitter, App.net, Flickr, and other services. He calls them <a href="http://noahread.net/blog/snippets">Snippets</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Microblogging and social sharing will survive, whether or not the current players do. So I wanted to take control of the things I publish on these networks, without abandoning the great things only they can provide, the conversations and reactions to what is shared. So Snippets are the way I will post to these services from now on.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Check out <a href="http://noahread.net/snippets">Noah’s snippets feed</a>. I especially like the name. As a programmer I’m used to thinking “code snippet” when I hear it, but with enough use it’d be easy to reclaim its normal non-code definition.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/a-eulogy-for-twitter/361339/">The Atlantic has an interesting essay</a> on whether Twitter is on a slow decline, less useful and meaningful than it once was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Twitter is the platform that led us into the mobile Internet age. It broke our habit of visiting individual news homepages first thing in the morning, and established behaviors built around real-time news consumption and production. It normalized mobile publishing power. It changed our expectations about how we congregate around shared events. Twitter has done for social publishing what AOL did for email. But nobody has AOL accounts anymore.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It reminds me of something I brought up on Core Intuition a few months back, wondering if Twitter is a core part of the web, something that would be with us forever, or if it is “just another web site”. When we get into the groove of using a new service for a few years, it’s easy to forget that web sites don’t have a very good track record. Giant sites like Facebook and Tumblr seem to have been with us forever, but my personal blog is older than both.</p>
<p>Think about this: if it’s even <em>possible</em> for Twitter to fail — not likely, just possible — then why are we putting so much of our content there first, where there are <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms">rules for how tweet text can be used</a>? Storage for all tweets is so massive that there’s no guarantee that other companies will be able to take over the archive if the service has to fold. It’s why I built <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a> to archive and publish tweets.</p>
<p>Decentralization is the internet’s greatest strength and weakness. There shouldn’t be <a href="https://medium.com/">one service</a> to hold all of blogging; each writer should have his or her own domain and web site. But web sites also die all the time from neglect. We need centralized services to index and syndicate content so that it’s <a href="../../../2012/07/permanence.html">preserved</a> and accessible to more people.</p>
<p>Longevity is the next great challenge for the web. All of my work on Riverfold apps is leading this way, from archiving tweets, to <a href="http://sunlit.io/">curating and publishing your best photos</a>, to <a href="http://searchpath.io/">indexing a copy of the text and HTML from your blog</a>. But I’m just one guy with a limited server budget.</p>
<p>It’s time for a new web standard — a metadata format and API that describes how to mirror published content. Maybe it’s part of <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">IndieWebCamp</a>? When I write on my blog, I want the content to flow to GitHub Pages, to the Internet Archive, to Medium. When I post photos, I want the content to flow to Dropbox, to S3, to Flickr. It’s not enough to backup or copy data blindly; the source must point to each mirror, and each mirror service must understand who the creator is and how to find the original data if it still exists.</p>
<p>Unlike a distributed platform that works at the level of raw data, like BitTorrent, this new system should work natively with well-understood common files: text, photos, video, and the glue (usually HTML, Markdown, or JSON) that makes a collection meaningful. Instead of yet another generic sync system, it’s a platform that understands publishing, with adapters to flow content into each mirror’s native storage.</p>
<p>If you accept that this is something worth doing, then every place we put our content must be classified as either an original source or a mirror. And this brings us back to Twitter. Because while I think the next 5 years for Twitter will be strong, I’m not convinced that it will last 50 years. Therefore, Twitter cannot be an original source of data; it must be just one of several mirrors for micro-blogging.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Yesterday <a href="http://firesid.es/Chat/billkunz">Bill Kunz was interviewed on Firesides</a>, talking about his app Felix, and life as an indie developer vs. at a startup. Bill was especially open about how he used his own savings to build Felix, and some of the planning problems he ran into:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “One thing I would do differently &#8211; and this is probably going to come out wrong &#8211; but I would have stuck to my guns on my own plans better. I added quite a few niche features that ultimately ended up not being used, when I could have spent that time on the core of the app, or other projects. I burned a lot, lot, lot of time on things I ultimately didn’t need to.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Firesides is a very nice use of App.net. You can browse chat transcripts from previous guests without signing in, or sign in with App.net to ask questions when there’s a chat taking place. It’s a little like Reddit’s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/">Ask Me Anything</a>, but more readable and visually appealing, and built on the App.net messaging platform.</p>

			<p><a href="http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/84237156390/ios-7-squandered-a-year-of-third-party-development-on">Jared Sinclair writes about iOS 7 as a squandered year</a> for third-party developers:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Fast-forwarding a year, the effect that iOS 7 has had on third party development is disheartening — which sounds like a fatuous thing to say, since there have been so many well-liked redesigns over the past year. But that’s the rub: the vast majority of third-party developers’ time has been spent redesigning and reimplementing apps to dress the part for iOS 7.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Jared that it was a sort of lost year for app features, but <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/04/29/the_cost_of_ios_7">Brent also has a point</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Jared argues that iOS 7 wasn’t urgent, that evolution rather than revolution would have been fine, since customer satisfaction was extremely high with iOS 6. In retrospect I agree, but were I at Apple I would have argued that the situation is like tech debt — UI debt — and it’s best to deal with it quickly, completely, and early.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>They had to deal with it all at once because UIKit’s look and feel didn’t really evolve the same way Mac OS X usually does, a little each year. Even Aqua, the most dramatic change ever to the Mac’s UI, was fairly straightforward for developers to adopt; if you stuck with consistent Mac controls, you got a lot for free. There was very little of that kind of consistency on iOS because developers frequently built their own custom UIs which had to be thrown out when iOS 7 happened.</p>

			<p>While doing our taxes this month, I was a little surprised just how much I spend for various web apps and services to help run <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">Riverfold</a>. While I could trim some of them, most are essential and save a lot of time. I thought it would be interesting to write up some of the most important ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=f61c5d1648c72ebcf5bd8175aca79cfe5b374401"><strong>Linode</strong></a>: I’ve moved nearly everything to Linode. I like their style: just basic, solid hosting, with good features but not an overwhelming number of services or fancy stuff. They’ve recently increased their RAM and added SSD. I have servers there for Nginx/Unicorn, MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch. I also use their load balancer and Longview stats app. This link uses <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=f61c5d1648c72ebcf5bd8175aca79cfe5b374401">my referral code</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/"><strong>Amazon Web Services</strong></a>: I no longer use EC2, but I have some DNS hosted in Amazon’s Route 53. I also use S3 for backups and a new feature that’s coming to <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> soon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.heroku.com/"><strong>Heroku</strong></a>: Before moving to Linode, most of my stuff was on Heroku. Now I only have one small app and database there, and I’ll be completely moved off by the end of the year. I’m including it here for completeness only. It’s a great option to get started if you don’t want to be a part-time system administrator, but I think <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/03/27/web-hosting-for-app-developers">Marco sums up nicely why you want to use Linux servers</a> instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://stripe.com/"><strong>Stripe</strong></a>: Can’t say enough good things about Stripe. Watermark, Searchpath, Tweet Marker, and Core Intuition Jobs all use it for credit card processing. It’s the best.</p>
<p><a href="http://gaug.es/"><strong>Gauges</strong></a>: As much as I always loved <a href="http://haveamint.com/">Mint</a>, as my business grew to several web apps and web sites, I looked for a new stats package that could support any number of sites, and which would work better across hosts, since I don’t need to run the database. I’ve been very happy with this.</p>
<p><a href="http://appfigures.com/"><strong>AppFigures</strong></a>: I’ve used this for years to track <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> sales. It’s great. I also like that I can enter other people’s popular apps and get an idea of how they’re trending if they make it to the top lists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blinksale.com/"><strong>Blinksale</strong></a>: Kind of an ancient invoicing app that hasn’t changed at all in years, but it works so I keep using it. Originally started by the folks who would go on to do Gowalla.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.beanstalkapp.com/"><strong>Beanstalk</strong></a>: I moved the source for all my Riverfold projects here because it can do Subversion and Git well. I sometimes wonder if I should move to GitHub instead, since I do use GitHub and have a couple tiny public repositories there, but I like that Beanstalk is focused only on private hosting. No social; just a well-designed web app.</p>
<p><a href="https://postmarkapp.com/"><strong>Postmark</strong></a>: Run by the same team as Beanstalk. I switched to this after Sendgrid had <a href="../../../2013/03/moving_off.html">some PR problems you may remember</a>. Email receipts and whatnot go through Postmark now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/"><strong>Dreamhost</strong></a>: Still using this for email and a few static or PHP sites. It’s cheap and works well. Not much benefit in moving away from it, though I prefer my more important web apps to be hosted on Linode.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnsimple.com/"><strong>DNSimple</strong></a>: I have a few domains here and hope to have all of them moved over eventually. I want to have a single place for DNS. Right now I have registration and DNS hosting spread across Dreamhost, Amazon, and Network Solutions. Makes it difficult to remember where everything is and to keep track of expirations.</p>
<p><a href="https://bufferapp.com/"><strong>Buffer</strong></a>: This company has been on my radar since someone asked me to support it in Tweet Library. They also have a really interesting blog where they share revenue, salaries, subscribers, web traffic, and other usually private details from a company. I admire that a lot. <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel</a> and I use it to automate sending Core Intuition Jobs links to Twitter, App.net, and Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/"><strong>Mapbox</strong></a>: We use Mapbox throughout Sunlit. I wrote more <a href="../../../2014/01/sunlit_maps.html">about why here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/"><strong>FogBugz</strong></a>: In the past I’ve build my own bug tracker, used Jira, Redmine, GitHub issues, and others I’m forgetting. They all have problems so for Riverfold I keep it simple with hosted FogBugz. To complement this I use OmniFocus for non-bug tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/"><strong>Zendesk</strong></a>: For too long I was just using Apple’s Mail.app to handle support email. Now support email goes to Zendesk, where I can better track and reply to it. The downside is I’ve had a couple cases of people not seeing the replies, possibly because the HTML email is more often flagged as spam. Need to investigate whether I can switch it to plaintext, but otherwise I’m happy.</p>
<p><a href="http://keen.io/"><strong>Keen.io</strong></a>: I was inspired to try this after reading <a href="http://carpeaqua.com/2014/04/08/data-analytics-that-matter/">Justin’s post on analytics</a>. I’m experimenting with it to get better insight into how people are using my apps. So far so good.</p>
<p><a href="https://tapstream.com/"><strong>Tapstream</strong></a>: Just started using this to help track Twitter ads and other links, to see what marketing actually converts to App Store sales. The web app is good, they responded to a support question the same day, and I love that the SDK is just a handful of .m files that can be dropped into an iOS project.</p>
<p>And that’s it. I may have left a few things out (like consumer-focused apps Dropbox, App.net, and Twitter), but these certainly cover the major services I use now. In the old days it was common to just have one server that did everything. Now there are so many specialized services. While it seems like a lot to manage, each one does a much better job than I could do with a home-grown solution.</p>

			<p>I was talking to friends this week about app advertising, and it inspired me to try Twitter ads. Otherwise known as “promoted tweets”, these ads are actual tweets that show up in search results and timelines, even if the user isn’t following your account. <a href="../../../2014/04/tweet_library_25.html">Tweet Library 2.5</a> seemed like the perfect time to try this.</p>
<p>I set a max of $5 a day and included several related Twitter accounts to help the ads find a more narrow audience of people who might want to buy Tweet Library. Here are the results after 24 hours:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2014/promoted_tweets_dashboard.png" width="600" height="367" alt="Promoted tweets dashboard" border="0" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t have an easy way to track this all the way to actual App Store sales. Assuming a 5% conversion on App Store visits, I likely lost a little money. The extra 1800 impressions is nice though, to raise awareness about the app. I’m going to let it run for a week.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>There&#8217;s a new update to <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> out today. Major additions include CSV file export to Dropbox and new URL schemes for starting a search, export, or publish. The URL schemes look like this:</p>
<p>twtlib://username/search?q=hello&amp;collection=Favorites</p>
<p>twtlib://username/export?collection=Testing</p>
<p>twtlib://username/publish?collection=Testing</p>
<p>twtlib://username/storify?collection=Testing</p>
<p>There are a few other important bug fixes too, especially to importing the Tweets.zip archive from Twitter.</p>
<p>When I gave up on Twitter as a user, many people asked if I would abandon Tweet Library. I wasn&#8217;t sure at first, but the answer now is a clear &#8220;no&#8221;. In fact, since my last personal tweet in 2012, I&#8217;ve released new features and even redesigned the app for iOS 7.</p>
<p>But I do need to start consolidating my work on Tweet Library and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>, because the apps share so many concepts around archiving and search. To that end, this week I&#8217;m retiring tweetlibrary.com as a way to browse and publish collections. The site will now redirect to a special landing page on Watermark. Published collections from Tweet Library also go to a public page on Watermark.</p>
<p>It was a tough decision to change the tweetlibrary.com URLs, but maintaining separate web apps that are so similar made everything more complicated, holding back what I could build. Having a single web codebase (Watermark) will ultimately let me improve both Tweet Library and Watermark more quickly.</p>

			<p>You may have heard by now that <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/04/16/silverpine-software/">Photos+ has a new home at SilverPine software</a>. My friend Jonathan Hays — now co-founder of SilverPine — is of course also half of <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a>, so it was a great fit for him to take on another photo app as well. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “In addition to consulting, we intend to slowly grow a portfolio of software. To that end, we are announcing today that we have purchased Photos+ from Second Gear Software. We have quite a bit of expertise with photo Apps (see Sunlit, among others) and when Justin Williams approached me about purchasing it from him, it felt like a great fit. We have big plans for Photos+ and have already put into motion the first phase of those plans: native Dropbox integration!”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I tested the Dropbox support during the 1.1 beta and think it’s a great direction to take the app. Dropbox the company is going all in on photos: just in the last week shipping Carousel and now acquiring Loom. The more people start using Dropbox to store all their photos, the more useful companion photo apps like Photos+ and Sunlit will be.</p>
<p>And now <a href="http://carpeaqua.com/2014/04/17/moonshots/">Justin Williams is free to focus all his time on Glassboard</a>. While I’ve been building web services and subscription apps for a while now, the truth is I’m still figuring out how to do this as a business too. I’ve learned a lot from Justin’s recent blog posts on the subject.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>It has been nearly a year since the first iOS 7 beta, and something about tint color still bugs me. In fact it bothered me enough at the time of the early betas that a filed a bug on it with Apple, something I very rarely do. The problem isn’t so much in the concept of tint color, which I like; having a consistent color for buttons and links, especially now that buttons are so understated, makes a lot of sense. The problem is the implementation in apps that use tint color anytime they want to highlight something, whether it is tappable or not.</p>
<p>Here’s an example in Apple’s calendar app. It uses a red tint color for buttons, but it also highlights the current day with a round circle using the tint color. It looks tappable, but it’s not.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2014/tint_calendar.png" width="600" height="200" alt="Calendar" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" /></p>
<p>And here’s an even worse example, from the App Store app. “Categories” in this screenshot is a button, but “Paid” directly underneath it — same blue, same font and style — is just highlighted to show that you are viewing paid apps. It’s actually “Top Grossing” that is the button.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2014/tint_appstore.png" width="600" height="200" alt="App Store" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" /></p>
<p>These kind of usability mistakes turn the great potential of tint color into a disadvantage. It’s like underlined text on the web that can’t be clicked. Apps should use tint color to improve usability, not to become even more difficult to use than if everyone rolled their own button styles.</p>
<p>Here’s what Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/transitionguide/AppearanceCustomization.html">iOS 7 UI Transition Guide</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “In iOS 7, tint color is a property of UIView. iOS 7 apps often use a tint to define a key color that indicates interactivity and selection state for UI elements throughout the app.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>But that’s not specific enough. The app screenshots above are following this rule, and it still looks wrong. Bold text or a gray background for highlights are much more effective to show selection state than tint color. I would completely avoid tint color for selection state except for controls that have 3 or more segments, such as a tab bar, and even then sparingly. Highlighting a 1- or 2-segment control with tint color is always going to be confusing, because the selected segment looks like it can be tapped.</p>
<p>With this in mind, fixing the App Store app is a simple change:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2014/tint_appstore2.png" width="600" height="200" alt="App Store" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" /></p>
<p>(You could make the “Top Grossing” button blue or not. I don’t think it’s necessary in this case.)</p>
<p>The best iOS 7 apps I’ve seen follow the spirit of Apple’s guidelines, but they know when to push beyond Apple’s built-in apps and when to pull back and do less. Tint color seems like an obvious case of where we should be more consistent and strict than Apple intended.</p>

			<p>It’s SXSW this weekend, and while I’m again not attending this year, it’s a reminder that today is the 12th anniversary of starting this blog. I took some time today to fix the categories and tags on about a dozen older posts. One of those was fun to rediscover, <a href="../../../2002/09/john_siracusa_has.html">linking to John Siracusa’s review of Mac OS X 10.2</a>. Here’s the part from John that I quoted:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “And forget about any truly forward-looking features akin to Copland’s saved searches or BeOS’s metadata-powered custom views. Put simply, the Finder, once the crown jewel of the Mac user interface, no longer seems to be a priority at Apple.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>That was September 2002. It feels like it has really taken until 10.9 Mavericks (with tags and Finder tabs) for that to change.</p>

			<p>This line in a <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/space-jam-sequel-is-in-the-works-96410.html">blog post on Cartoon Brew</a> made me laugh:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It’s certainly possible to write a Looney Tunes script, just as it’s possible to eat a hamburger with your feet, but there are smarter, easier, and better ways to do it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Every industry that gets big probably has some of this. There’s the old school, the folks who know the right way to do things — for example, you start an animated film with sketches and storyboards, not words — and then there’s everyone who comes in afterwards, without the history and culture of what made it all work. Look at what the App Store has become, compared to how software development worked in the 1990s or early 2000s. If it wasn’t for all the money some of these new developers are making they’d be completely embarrassing themselves with technical naivety and <a href="http://www.bluecloudsolutions.com/blog/money-apps-turn-1k-200k-portfolio/">depressing lack of vision</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, great ideas often start with newcomers. But please respect the past before you break from it.</p>
