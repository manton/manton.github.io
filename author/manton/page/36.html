				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a politically-themed post. Probably the only one before 2008, so don&#8217;t run away just yet.</p>
<p>The Bush veto of the bipartisan children&#8217;s health care plan a few weeks ago really made me angry, but it wasn&#8217;t until &#8220;Justin Miller responded&#8221;:http://twitter.com/incanus77/statuses/310113392 to &#8220;my tweet&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/310110182 that I started to think about why. Here&#8217;s the reason.</p>
<p>When Bush was elected in 2000, I expected this kind of stuff from him. Vetoing stem cell research? Killing children&#8217;s health care funding? Sure, par for the course for this Republican. But then 9-11 happened and everything changed. The war. Our president&#8217;s priorities changed.</p>
<p>Bush got a free ride from the media during the 2000 election, and again after 9-11. He would make the most incompetent and clumsy mistakes and yet be cut slack because, frankly, expectations are just so much lower for him than any other president in recent history.</p>
<p>At some point in 2004, opinion started to shift, led by folks like Howard Dean (who I&#8217;ve &#8220;written about before&#8221;:http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amanton.org+howard+dean). Eventually, after Bush won re-election, there would be enough anti-war momentum to matter. And that brings us up to now and this veto.</p>
<p>Everyone is focused on the war. Everyone understands the significance, the mistakes. Most of the country wants it over but we know that it&#8217;s complex, and the consequences for any given action will be felt for a decade. Compared to the lives lost in Iraq and the harm done to the stability of the Middle East, the rise of a new generation of terrorists &#8212; what does a health care bill matter? Is it worth fighting for?</p>
<p>Democrats in power by a slim majority probably think they have to choose their battles, have to give in on some issues so they can hold on to the important ones, like the war. But I say no. The only thing that works against this stubborn ass in the White House is to take the fight to him. Cut him off at every turn. Don&#8217;t give him a freakin&#8217; inch. Call for an override vote again and again.</p>
<p>Every. Single. Day.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how you win. You put people on the ground in every state &#8212; organizing, protesting, getting out the vote. You put letters in the hands of our representatives &#8212; email, blogs, editorial, flyers. You put a loud voice to what you feel and never, ever back down.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Happy Halloween! &#8220;Wii Transfer 2.5.2&#8243;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ is now available. This is probably one of the most difficult bug fix releases I&#8217;ve done. Full changes are in &#8220;the release notes&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/releasenotes/, but the biggest stuff includes fixed Leopard UI glitches and a new 2-pass encoding that should result in much more consistent movie streaming quality. Along the way I touched most of the corners of the product, including many hours of trial-and-error debugging the Flash FLV player component.</p>
<p>While testing Wii Transfer on my TV the other day I had a moment to reflect on how this product has evolved. What started as a one-weekend hack has grown into something quite a bit more complex. It has a few rough edges, sure, but I&#8217;m proud of this little app and how I&#8217;ve been able to put a simple UI on all these different technologies (embedded web server, HTML/JavaScript/Flash UI, MP3 and FLV conversion, iLife integration, etc). I have a few new features planned and in various stages of development, but I think the just-released 2.5.2 is going to start a trend of refinement; there&#8217;s a lot I could do to improve the movie conversion and streaming experience before introducing anything radically new.</p>
<p>So, Leopard. I had originally planned to just wipe my old Leopard seed partition on the MacBook and test the GM, but at the last minute I dove full in and did an upgrade install on my primary machine, the Mac Pro. I have nightly SuperDuper clones just in case, but the upgrade was completely smooth. It&#8217;s a great OS foundation and I can&#8217;t wait to see what other developers have been working on.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>After I shipped Wii Transfer 2.5 I decided to start spending a little time promoting the product. Every month or so I&#8217;ll do some small thing to improve sales. Last month that was a &#8220;press release&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/press/2.5.html, followed by the &#8220;ad on The Talk Show&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/10/the_talk_show.html, and next month I&#8217;ll be giving away a brand new Nintendo Wii as a holiday promotion.</p>
<p>Today Wii Transfer is on sale at &#8220;macZOT&#8221;:http://www.maczot.com/ for the incredibly low price of just $9 (half off!). To be honest I have mixed feelings about these kind of promotions, and the first time macZOT approached me about it I declined. I worry that it can reinforce a message that all software should be cheap &#8212; that even $19 is too expensive &#8212; but on the other hand it&#8217;s great exposure to an audience that might not otherwise hear about Wii Transfer.</p>
<p>Lisa at macZOT has been great to work with, letting me set the price (even though I get a small fraction of what a normal sale would be, I felt it was important to do the promotion to its fullest and go below $10), and making sure macZOT pings my backend script so that serial numbers go out to customers right away. I know people can be frustrated if they have to wait to receive the product, and I also have a new serial number lookup form on the site that ties into all of this quite nicely.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fun experiment. If you&#8217;ve been thinking about purchasing Wii Transfer but thought it was too expensive, head over to macZOT to pick up your copy. The &#8220;discussion page&#8221;:http://maczot.com/discuss/?p=563 will probably have some comments too.</p>

			<p>Late notice, but I&#8217;ll have a watercolor piece in tonight&#8217;s Monster Mash art show at the Lowbrow Emporium on South Lamar. If you&#8217;re in Austin, drop by between 7 and 11pm and say hi. (Address and other details on &#8220;the poster by Jason Chalker&#8221;:http://austinsketchsquad.blogspot.com/2007/09/they-did-mashit-was-monster-mash.html.) The art is from participants and friends of the Austin Sketch Squad, some of whom will be doing live art at the show. There will also be free beer and candy!</p>
<p>I snapped a &#8220;photo of my desk with art stuff&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/1558857105/ while I was preparing for the show. I forgot to scan the final art, which sadly didn&#8217;t come out nearly as nice as my first sketch, but I&#8217;ll get a picture of that tonight. It was fun to work on and a nice break from late-night programming this week.</p>

			<p>Ambrosia Software&#8217;s &#8220;Andrew Welch in a TUAW interview&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/10/03/tuaw-interview-ambrosias-andrew-welch-on-the-iphone-update-and/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The tack they are taking with the ringtones, though, is not &#8216;We&#8217;ll provide such great ringtones that you&#8217;ll want to buy from us&#8217; but rather &#8216;This is all you&#8217;re ever going to be able to use, too bad if you want to use something else.&#8217; I think they took a winning formula, and got it entirely backwards.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the most disappointing part of what Apple is doing. Even with the iTunes Store, when they had to lock down the songs to appease the music industry, they still thought about the user: songs on 5 machines, unlimited iPods, multiple iTunes accounts on the same machine, great selection, and effortless buying experience. I can wait for a real iPhone SDK (WWDC 2008 please Apple kthxbye), but Apple of all companies should not let corporate deals needlessly cripple the ringtone user experience.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Episode 11 of &#8220;The Talk Show&#8221;:http://www.thetalkshow.net/ is up, and I&#8217;m happy to say that &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ is this week&#8217;s sponsor. Even if you&#8217;ve been subscribed since the first show, click over to see the new site design by &#8220;Airbag Industries&#8221;:http://airbagindustries.com/. It&#8217;s beautifully done and I tried to create an ad graphic that feels at home there.</p>
<p>For the Wii Transfer ad text I included &#8220;Only for Mac&#8221;, partly to discourage any Windows listeners from clicking and to set expectations that Wii Transfer is not a web site, but also because after a decade of being ignored I think Mac users like to be reminded that there is a bunch of great software just for them.</p>
<p>Earlier this month &#8220;Daniel Jalkut wrote about the unlikelihood of MarsEdit for Windows&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/394/blogging-from-windows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I love writing software for the Mac. If I had to write software for another platform, I probably wouldn&#8217;t be nearly as interested in doing it. Heck, I might work more on becoming a musician, or a designer, or one of the other many trades that I have an interest in. For that reason, the chances of MarsEdit for Windows are almost nil.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I love that Mac indies are receiving so many &#8220;what about a Windows version?&#8221; requests. I get similar emails every couple weeks about Wii Transfer for Windows, and luckily there are a couple Windows or open source alternatives that I can point people to. (Some of them are even cross-platform and available for Mac, but they are of the &#8220;double click this Java .jar file&#8221; variety, so I don&#8217;t generally consider them direct competition.)</p>
<p>It used to feel strange getting these requests. I would respond with &#8220;maybe&#8221; and &#8220;unlikely&#8221;, suggesting that it&#8217;s probably not going to happen but leaving open the possibility, as Daniel did when he said &#8220;almost nil&#8221;. Then I realized &mdash; who am I kidding? &mdash; I&#8217;m <em>never</em> going to port this to Windows regardless of demand. Never. &#8220;With the right team&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ I enjoy working on cross-platform apps, just as I appreciate meetings, planning, and the other formalities (in moderation) that come with a more corporate environment. But Wii Transfer isn&#8217;t about any of that; it&#8217;s my vacation from the real world, and on my time I use and build for Macs.</p>
<p>Also read the Airfoil for Windows section of &#8220;Ars Technica&#8217;s interview with Paul Kafasis&#8221;:http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/2/2/6863 from February.</p>

			<p>I have a copy of CS3. Photoshop, Illustrator, and Flash are all permanently in my Dock. If you do any graphics or animation work, you pretty much need these tools, in the same way that anyone who does any kind of corporate writing needs Word.</p>
<p>But truthfully, I haven&#8217;t had Microsoft Office installed for about a year (I use Pages or Leopard&#8217;s QuickLook to read other people&#8217;s Word documents), and I see a similar fate for some of the big Adobe apps. Despite &#8220;what some people have said&#8221;:http://theocacao.com/document.page/271 over the years, there will never be a permanent replacement for Photoshop &#8212; it is too powerful, does too much &#8212; but there could be a healthy market of smaller, focused tools that tackle one piece of the Photoshop puzzle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flying Meat&#8217;s Acorn&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/ is the first of those tools that actually delivers. For the most part I can use Acorn as if I was using Photoshop. Keyboard shortcuts for switching tools, selection, basic layer manipulation &#8212; it all works.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been testing Acorn by working on some new UI mockups, a task it seems particularly well-suited for. One of the most refreshing things has been using a text tool that renders text just as it would look in a normal NSTextField control. Photoshop has a few anti-aliasing settings, but nothing that exactly matches the normal Mac OS X rendering, which makes mockups that mix and match screenshots from Interface Builder and new text look out of place.</p>
<p>As a 1.0, this is a very solid app, and most importantly it gets all that non-delicious stuff right. It would be easy when writing a Photoshop competitor to focus on the fun stuff &#8212; Core Image filters or whatnot &#8212; so it&#8217;s nice to see Gus didn&#8217;t gloss over the basics.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s missing? After using it for a couple weeks for real work, the only things I am particularly missing are layer groups (totally understand why he left those out for now), Save for Web (which I hear is coming shortly), and Copy Merged (did I miss it?). And the big one: Open/Save for Photoshop files. It doesn&#8217;t need anything fancy in the .psd files, just the same features of a .acorn file to allow a designer to move between the apps if necessary.</p>
<p>Right as I&#8217;m about to post this, &#8220;Pixelmator finally ships&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/09/25/pixelmator-hits-1-0/. I&#8217;ve only spent a few minutes with it, but it also looks pretty competent. Time will tell whether it holds up for real work as well as Acorn has for me.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>This morning I finally rolled out &#8220;version 2.5 of Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/, the most significant release of the product yet. It probably deserved a 3.0 label slapped on it, but I like how all the 2.x releases revolve around the sharing features (sending movies, music, and pictures to the Wii via the Opera browser). Besides, I have a special set of entirely new stuff planned for 3.0.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new? Movie streaming is the big one. You can now drag and drop movie files to convert to Flash Video format, which Wii Transfer&#8217;s web server will happily stream up to your Wii. It works surprisingly well considering the Wii has such limited memory and no hard drive. Last night I even tested with feature-length movies.</p>
<p>Other new features include background music for picture slideshows (both MP3 and AAC) and bookmark sharing, so that you can browse your Safari or Firefox bookmarks on your Wii to easily visit those sites. The &#8220;release notes&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/releasenotes/ page has more of the details.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also bumped the price up to $19, where I expect it to stay for some time. One way I like to think about the price of Wii Transfer is in relation to another common purchase from Wii owners: games. It&#8217;s still less than half the price of a new Wii game.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the beta testers who provided feedback. There are still a number of things about movie sharing that I&#8217;d like to polish up, so additional minor updates are likely. I often use the &#8220;Wii account on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii to post these and other announcements.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Damon Clinkscales has a write-up&#8221;:http://damonclinkscales.com/past/lone-star-charity-workshop-wrap-up/ of the Charity Workshop that took place before the Lone Star Ruby Conference in Austin a couple weekends ago. I skipped the conference and attended these tutorials instead, enjoying some great talks by Marcel Molina, Bruce Williams, and 6 other speakers all packed into 4 hours. I definitely picked up a few good tips on Ruby blocks and ActiveRecord, but I was not-so-secretly relieved that I didn&#8217;t attend the full conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since brunch on Sunday&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalnomad/1352583178/ after the conference, where I got to hear another wrap-up from co-workers, I&#8217;ve been thinking about why. Why did I sell my RailsConf ticket and book a flight to Chicago for C4 instead? Why skip a cheap Ruby conference practically in my own backyard? Why have I whittled my Ruby-themed blog subscriptions down to just a few from dozens?</p>
<p>Now I know: it&#8217;s about the difference in the communities. The Mac developer community is all about building  unique apps, crafting an excellent user experience, and the &#8220;indie culture&#8221;:http://www.al3x.net/2007/08/c41-friday.html of building something small and useful. The Rails community by contrast seems focused on how few lines of code a controller method is. I&#8217;m lucky to work with people who care about that stuff, because it often does yield better applications, but I just don&#8217;t wake up in the morning excited about rewriting code, so why would I leave my family for a few days to hear someone talk about it?</p>
<p>There are many kinds of programmers. People who have hacked their whole life, dropping out of school to sell software; traditional developers with a CS degree and big company background; and even fine arts majors who fell into programming by accident as a way to build web sites. Based on that background, or what direction their passion takes them, I believe there is a balance between joy for the <em>act of writing code</em> vs. the pride in <em>seeing the final product</em>, and each programmer leans to one way or the other.</p>
<p>For Rails developers, at least many of the leaders in the industry who came from or were inspired by the extreme programming methodology and test-driven development, it&#8217;s the former: the art is found in the lines of code &#8212; how efficient can the logic be, how DRY, how RESTful.</p>
<p>For Mac developers, not just the &#8220;Delicious Generation&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Article/DeliciousGeneration-2006-11-06-10-00 but old school Mac developers as well, it&#8217;s the latter: the art is how the final product looks and behaves &#8212; being inspired to build something simply because you used another application that was great.</p>
<p>Cutting it this way allows me to see two things very clearly that were confusing before. It puts specifics to why I&#8217;ve drifted further away from the Rails cutting edge, and it explains why I get so annoyed with some of the newer crop of Mac developers who proclaim &#8220;bindings&#8221;:http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000080.php and garbage collection as beautiful gifts for programmer productivity even though they have no added value for the user experience.</p>
<p>Rails is a great framework, and I will continue to enjoy switching gears to write web apps in between my Mac projects. But I&#8217;m not going to tune back into that community until there is an equal focus on the bigger picture as it impacts the user (more scaling, more UI best practices), or whatever the next big thing to hit web apps ends up being.</p>

			<p>Soundtrack for this blog post: &#8220;The Touch&#8221;:http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=254632798&amp;s=143441&amp;i=254632948 from the 1980s Transformers feature.</p>
<p>Yesterday Apple announced new iPods, plus cool stuff like the Starbucks integration and iTunes Wi-fi Store. I was out at lunch and errands, so I followed the announcements on my iPhone with Safari and Twitter. If the new store had been available, I probably would have bought some music too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave Winer had mixed feelings about the new stuff&#8221;:http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/09/05/will2007BeLike1984.html, but likes how the iPod is evolving to be its own full-featured client:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They are interesting if only because they illustrate so clearly that it&#8217;s possible to get content onto the iPod directly, without synching, without tethering to a laptop or desktop computer. I think the users will love this, and it will quickly become the primary way music gets on the device.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The $200 price drop on the iPhone was a surprise. My first thought: Apple is totally playing to win. With such an aggressive price drop, they plan to own the high-end market, and maybe some of the middle too. It never crossed my mind that I was ripped off paying $599 until I started reading &#8220;comments in this TUAW post&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/09/05/apple-lowers-price-of-8-gig-iphone-to-399/. These are the same kind of people who say &#8220;I like your software but <em>I wish it was free</em>&#8221; to indie Mac developers.</p>
<p>The iPhone was expensive at $599 but worth it, and the new price doesn&#8217;t change that fact. It&#8217;s allowed me to work even more remotely, stay connected to friends, get unlost using maps in a new city, and greatly improve how I use a mobile phone.</p>
<p>(I wrote most of the rest of this blog post a couple weeks ago. It was originally titled &#8220;1000 emails in your pocket&#8221;, but that was before I saw Craig Hockenberry&#8217;s excellent &#8220;Benchmarking in your pants&#8221;:http://furbo.org/2007/08/15/benchmarking-in-your-pants/ blog post, which while not as directly accurate to Apple&#8217;s original iPod marketing, was much more funny.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to post specifically about the sessions at C4 yet, because anything I say would be redundant against posts from &#8220;Alex Payne&#8221;:http://www.al3x.net/2007/08/c41-friday.html, &#8220;John Gruber&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2007/08/c4_1_in_a_nut, and &#8220;Mike Zornek&#8221;:http://blog.clickablebliss.com/2007/08/13/c41-retrospective/, among others. Instead I want to follow up &#8220;my original iPhone report&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/07/iphone_its_from.html with how the phone performed during travel.</p>
<p>There were a <em>lot</em> of iPhones at last month&#8217;s C4 conference. I had such good luck using the iPhone at the airport and on the train and walking around Chicago, I took my MacBook&#8217;s dead battery as a sign to stick to the iPhone all weekend, using it exclusively for email, Twitter, blog reading, and general web surfing. I responded to a handful of emails, used SMS for sending tweets, and hit the iPhone version of Newsgator Online (synced from my NetNewsWire subscriptions) for news and blogs.</p>
<p>Sure, I was jealous of everyone running Twitterific while I had to refresh m.twitter.com manually, but overall the experience was great. As &#8220;Matt Haughey has blogged about&#8221;:http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2007/07/01/24-hours-with-the-iphone-my-dream-mini-computer/: the iPhone is a computer, and 3 full days of use proved to me that it&#8217;s extremely competent.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to two weeks ago and I went on a weekend road-trip to Dallas with only the iPhone, confident I could respond to email if needed. Same thing over the long Labor Day holiday: drove 7 hours both ways for 2 nights in Louisiana, easily able to follow up on bugs from a recent software release without my MacBook.</p>
<p>Of course there are a few rough edges: I don&#8217;t do significant server-side spam filtering, so deleting spam on the iPhone is getting tedious; paying a premium for SMS is annoying and counter to the unlimited web bandwidth; and my typing is only now to the point of pretty good. But otherwise any limitations with the built-in software are quickly becoming solved with new 3rd-party offerings, which have blossomed faster than most of us expected in no small part thanks to &#8220;Nullriver&#8217;s excellent installer&#8221;:http://iphone.nullriver.com/beta/.</p>
<p>Now the the only question is: what do I do with my &#8220;free $100&#8243;:http://www.apple.com/hotnews/openiphoneletter/?</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve been using &#8220;Ta-da List&#8221;:http://www.tadalist.com/ for the last couple of years for all my to-do lists. I have about 100 lists and love the speed of adding new items and some of the subtle smarts it applies to sorting recent lists and cleaning up completed ones.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve been on the lookout for a desktop app. OmniOutliner has become a bit bloated and all the Getting Things Done apps seem so structured. Along comes &#8220;TaskPaper&#8221;:http://hogbaysoftware.com/projects/taskpaper today and there&#8217;s a lot to like. The plain text file format is refreshing and nicely open.</p>
<p>I wrote a Ruby script to export all my lists from Ta-da into TaskPaper so that I can give it a proper workout. It makes a new document (with a single project) for each list it finds. Make sure to install &#8220;Hpricot&#8221;:http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/ first &#8212; there&#8217;s no official Ta-da List API so we need to parse HTML a little.</p>
<p>Download: &#8220;tadalist_taskpaper.rb&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/software/scripts/tadalist_taskpaper.rb</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the file in your favorite text editor and change TADALIST_HOST to whatever your account is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure Safari is running and you have logged into Ta-da. The script reads the cookie value from Safari&#8217;s Cookies.plist so that it doesn&#8217;t need to simulate a real sign-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run from the command line. It will create the new files in the current directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will see short status messages for what it is doing. It&#8217;s broken if there are any Ruby exceptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>From time to time on the &#8220;MacSB list&#8221;:http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/macsb people ask about the value of localization and what percentage of sales come from foreign customers. Since day 1 of &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ I&#8217;ve always been surprised at how many sales are from Europe. At times it felt as if over half of sales were outside the United States, so I finally ran the numbers to know for sure.</p>
<p>My homegrown customer database doesn&#8217;t actually include the physical address, so I grabbed the last 500 sales from PayPal and wrote a quick script to group the countries. Here&#8217;s the chart:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2007/sales_chart_countries.gif" border="0" height="265" width="341" alt="Wii Transfer countries chart" /></p>
<p>The United States represents just over half. If you add up the other English-speaking countries, it hits 70%. Still, this is a purely English-only piece of software. I&#8217;ve resisted the push to localize until I feel the codebase is better prepared for it, and the UI more stable.</p>
<p>At &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ last year I wrote a custom Rails web app to manage localization resources for both the Mac and Windows products and deal with the outsource translators, and the takeaway from that experience was definitely to go slowly. It&#8217;s easy to end up with a foreign language version that makes compromises and is potentially less useful to customers than the English version. Depending on the size of the product, localization could take weeks or months, time that might be better spent adding features.</p>
<p>Back to the real stats. Why are the foreign numbers so high? I think the weak dollar combined with an already relatively inexpensive price makes Wii Transfer even more of an impulse buy in Europe.</p>

			<p>Ignore that this post is a week late. While I was out sick last week there was a great discussion across blogs about email clients, starting with &#8220;Brent Simmons&#8221;:http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3425 and then to &#8220;Paul Kafasis&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Article/Rise-of-the-OS-2007-07-05-12-00.html while passing through several good blogs in between.</p>
<p>Some of my additional gripes about Mail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text editor is terrible for text-only email, especially when quoting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI refresh glitches with mailbox unread counts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sluggish showing new smart folders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search is not powerful enough without making smart folders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall stability problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I started writing an email client last year and worked on it in my spare time for a couple of months before abandoning it. It added a few new twists that other clients don&#8217;t have, including a server component in an attempt to embrace the benefits of both Gmail (access anywhere, automatic sync) and a native Mac client (better UI). No one I described it to thought they needed it, and I gave up before the UI was polished enough to actually show. Turns out the server piece was too complex and no matter how I juggled the numbers, it just didn&#8217;t seem a profitable endeavor.</p>
<p>The recent discussions really make we want to take some of the core pieces (great performance for huge amounts of mail and a tag-based filing system), rebuild it on top of IMAP instead of my custom web services gateway, and see what happens. But I probably won&#8217;t. Email clients are a tricky thing to get right, and I don&#8217;t have time right now to make it perfect.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that there is a market waiting for a great email client. You don&#8217;t need to compete with Mail.app, you just have to appeal to anyone who has been burned by an email client before. People who are serious about email.</p>

			<p>That&#8217;s the way I described the iPhone to anyone I showed it off to over the weekend. The thing is amazing. Easily the most advanced and beautiful UI that we have ever seen on a portable device.</p>
<p>I waited outside the Apple Store most of Friday to get an iPhone, and it contrasted very favorable with &#8220;my experience camping out for the Wii&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2006/11/nintendo_wii_purchase.html. The 6pm sale time decision was a smart one. It turns out waiting in line all day wasn&#8217;t necessary, but for anyone who had to have one on day 1 it was the safest choice, and it makes for a fun community. I ran into a bunch of people I knew and met new folks as well. Enjoyed catching up with &#8220;Donna Kidwell&#8221;:http://www.gamermom.com/ and had a chance to chat at length with Jeremy Derr of &#8220;Barton Springs Software&#8221;:http://www.bssware.com/.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damon YouTubed the line&#8221;:http://damonclinkscales.com/past/iphone-line-at-the-apple-store-the-domain/ in the early afternoon and by 6pm the line was roughly 250 people. We were in the low 40s and were in and out of the Apple Store in 15 minutes. They ran a great launch. Also a nice assortment of free water, tea, pizza, and coffee from both Apple and surrounding businesses. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a shot of me&#8221;:http://flickr.com/photos/digitalnomad/697023122/ from Damon&#8217;s Flickr stream.</p>

<p>Here are my posts to Twitter throughout the day, which also show part of the story:</p>
<p><em>6:34am:</em> Good morning iPhone Day! Weather forecast in Austin for today: 40% chance of showers and storms.</p>
<p><em>10:15am:</em> It&#8217;s only 10am but already realized I need to go to Plan B. Bribe friends already in line to use their 2nd iPhone purchase.</p>
<p><em>11:09am:</em> Change of plans. Heading to the Apple Store now to join in the line-waiting fun. Will it be too late?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>12:26pm:</em> I expected rain, but that seems unlikely. It&#8217;s hot like a real Austin summer here in the iPhone line.</p>
<p><em>2:32pm:</em> Hanging out in The Line with Jeremy of Barton Springs Software and @damon. Apple Store is closed. Had some lunch and a Starbucks soy latte.</p>
<p><em>4:03pm:</em> 2 hours left. We can redeem our free Starbucks coffee coupons now. Excited! (About the iPhone. Not the coffee.)</p>
<p><em>6:30pm:</em> Got my iPhone.</p>
<p><em>7:35pm:</em> Activation will have to wait. Ratatouille.</p>
<p><em>8:18pm:</em> Movies all sold out. Pre-activation dinner at Kerby Lane instead.</p>
<p><em>9:53pm:</em> Activation took less than a minute. Also, no plan choice. Just $20 added on to what I already pay, I guess.</p>
<p>Other reviews around the web:</p>
<p>&#8220;Matt Haughey&#8221;:http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2007/07/01/24-hours-with-the-iphone-my-dream-mini-computer/: &#8220;So in conclusion, the iPhone is nice from start to finish, but Safari is really the thing that turns it from a phone into a mini-laptop. Once I get more used to two-thumb typing, the last limitations that keep it from feeling like a real computer will be gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott Stevenson&#8221;:http://theocacao.com/document.page/488: &#8220;I usually don&#8217;t get too into pop culture events, but this is different. The Mac is going mainstream in a big way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ryan Irelan&#8221;:http://www.ryanirelan.com/past/2007/07/01/apple-iphone-brilliant-device-horrendous-activation/: &#8220;I probably tried out the emergency call slider three dozen times. I wonder if anyone actually called 911 because their phone wasn&#8217;t activating quickly enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Steven Frank&#8221;:http://stevenf.com/2007/07/the_official_stevenf_iphone_review.php: &#8220;Best phone ever. And given the rest of the industry&#8217;s generally pervasive cluelessness about pretty much everything, I don&#8217;t expect it to be surpassed by anything until the iPhone 2.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;John Gruber&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/iphone_first_impressions: &#8220;Overall day one impression: the iPhone is 95 percent amazing, 5 percent maddening. I&#8217;m just blown away by how nice it is &#8211; very thoughtful UI design and outstanding engineering.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I finally released &#8220;Wii Transfer 2.3&#8243;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ late last night. This is the version I demoed in &#8220;my interview with The Unofficial Apple Weblog&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/18/video-wii-transfer/. The most notable changes are AAC support, an improved music player interface, and better use of the Wii remote buttons.</p>
<p>This release sports a new icon, designed by Jordan Langille of &#8220;OneToad.com&#8221;:http://www.onetoad.com/. As much as I enjoy tinkering with Photoshop and Illustrator, I knew I didn&#8217;t have time to do a quality icon. I wanted something fun that still captured a part of the original icon, and this concept has really grown on me since it was finished almost 2 months ago.</p>
<p>I also took this opportunity to refresh the &#8220;Riverfold web site&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ design a little. Just don&#8217;t tell anyone that it still uses HTML tables.</p>

			<p><img src="../../../images/2007/moof_beer.jpg" alt="Moof" width="150" height="265" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="6" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /> Along with most of our house, my office is packed up and ready to move this week. The photo to the right is of one of the handful of items in a box labeled &#8220;Manton&#8217;s desk,&#8221; or, if someone else had her way, &#8220;Random junk Manton saves to remember the past but which should really be in the trash can.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unopened Moof beer from WWDC 1996, my first WWDC. At 20 I was too young to drink, but I probably would have saved it anyway. That was back when Apple gave you cool stuff and not just another cheap laptop bag.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s WWDC will probably go down as one of my favorites. The keynote was a bit dull, but it was offset by the reality that Leopard is a mature and usable system. I have been running all my primary apps off of it since last week, including Mail.app, NetNewsWire 3.0, and Xcode.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t place the feeling at the time, but now I realize that last week&#8217;s sessions were, in a way, relaxing. There was no sense of urgency. Most of the sessions I attended were practical, full of hands-on advice for preparing for Leopard and many applicable to Tiger development as well. I got a lot out of the week, and when I decided to skip out on Friday it didn&#8217;t feel like the world would come crashing down because of it.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2007/james_morrison.jpg" alt="James Morrison" width="300" height="226" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /> Other highlights of WWDC 2007 were away from the sessions: walking Chinatown with &#8220;Willie&#8221;:http://willie.tumblr.com/ on Sunday in search of the illusive bakery item; hitting the &#8220;SF Mac Indie party&#8221;:http://sfmacindie.com/ that night and hanging out with fellow developers afterwards; Buzz Andersen&#8217;s party Monday, catching up with &#8220;Lane&#8221;:http://www.monstro.com/ and the host; the &#8220;Dan Benjamin&#8221;:http://www.hivelogic.com/ annual breakfast; Apple &#8220;Design Awards&#8221;:http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/ada/ on Tuesday, which had a record number of wins for <em>apps I&#8217;ve actually used</em>; accidentally walking into a James Morrison concert at the Apple Store (left photo); being interviewed by Scott McNulty of &#8220;TUAW&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/, though I secretly hope they will decide not to air it; enjoying great Italian with the &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ team on Wednesday before catching the tail end of &#8220;CocoaHeads&#8221;:http://theocacao.com/document.page/480; plus the Apple Bash and more drinks and discussion Thursday night.</p>
<p>Like at &#8220;SXSW earlier this year&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/03/twitterconf.html, Twitter proves both cool and useful. I was lucky enough to meet many of the people on my Twitter friends list for the first time last week.</p>
<p>Of course it wasn&#8217;t all fun and games. I sifted through more legitimate Bookshelf bug reports than usual; I was exhausted pretty much every day; and there were a couple developers I had hoped to seek out that I just never made the time to.</p>
<p>All in all, though, a good week and now I&#8217;m ready to get back to coding.</p>

			<p>Today is a good day to release software. &#8220;MarsEdit gets a nice update&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/346/marsedit-12-growl-picasa-and-vox and &#8220;NetNewsWire 3.0&#8243;:http://ranchero.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=1646 ships. At VitalSource we also just released &#8220;Bookshelf 4.6&#8243;:http://www.vitalsource.com/index/bookshelf today, which lays the foundation for media-rich textbooks and adds a highlighter rating UI for any subscribed highlighters you have. This data will bubble up in a few places in the future to allow you to discover people and books, although for now it&#8217;s one-way.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a &#8220;short screencast of the rating interface&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/screencasts/2007/bookshelf_rating.mov (12 seconds, 700k). The star widget is a simple Cocoa control that hits a web service in the background. It was fun to write and surprisingly not very much code.</p>

			<p>Brent Simmons, from a &#8220;TUAW interview&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/05/5-questions-with-brent-simmons-creator-of-netnewswire/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One of the things I love about being a Mac developer is getting to meet the folks who make the apps I use. In a way, my /Applications folder is also my social network. Which is cool.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I never thought about it that way, but it&#8217;s definitely a great aspect of the Mac developer community. I hope to add a few more people to my /Applications social network next week at WWDC.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to a bunch of WWDCs now, but I&#8217;m particularly excited this year because it will be the first time I&#8217;ve attended as representing both a &#8220;large-ish company&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ and an &#8220;independent one-man shop&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/.</p>
<p>I will be carrying VitalSource business cards in my wallet, but I also hope to have a printed batch of Wii Transfer serial numbers to hand out. I know a lot of Mac developers have a Nintendo Wii and it&#8217;s a shame I haven&#8217;t given out more copies. If you have a Wii and see me (I look &#8220;something like this&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/me/), please get my attention so that I can correct this oversight.</p>

			<p>Since version 2.0, &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ has had a built-in web server for serving music and photos to the Nintendo Wii. The server was written in Cocoa and the code became very unwieldy as I continued to add features. Dozens of methods for processing different parts of the URL, and many if statements for conditionally branching based on the URL, splitting the URL parameters, and more.</p>
<p>The code looked something like this (only worse):</p>
<pre><code>

if (path startsWithSubstring:@"/albums") {

[self processAlbumsRequest:path];

}

else if (path startsWithSubstring:@"/artists") {

[self processArtistsRequest:path];

}

else {

// ...

}

(void) processAlbumsRequest:(NSString *)inPath

{

// split out the parameters and request extensions from the URL path

// ...

if ([e isEqualToString:"xml"]) {

// ...

}

else if ([e isEqualToString:"html"]) {

// ...

}

}

</code></pre>
<p>Multiply that times 10 for all the different URLs that Wii Transfer knows how to process, and you can see how it worked fine for a couple simple things, but quickly became a mess as I added features.</p>
<p>For the upcoming version 2.3, I redesigned most of the URLs to follow a common structure, patterned after the default URL syntax that Rails uses: /controller/action/id. Now, instead of if statements, I dynamically route the URL requests using NSSelectorFromString() and performSelector:withObject:.</p>
<p>Consider this code (as above, simplified from the real thing):</p>
<pre><code>

// extract the values from /controller/action/id URLs

NSArray* pieces = [[path stringByDeletingPathExtension] pathComponents];

NSString* controller = [pieces objectAtIndex:1];

NSString* action = [pieces objectAtIndex:2];

NSString* param_id = [pieces objectAtIndex:3];

// call a method named controller_action, passing it the id

NSString* sel_name = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@_%@:", controller, action];

SEL method = NSSelectorFromString (sel_name);

[self performSelector:method withObject:param_id];

</code></pre>
<p>Now if I need to invent a new URL, say &#8220;/tracks/play/1234.mp3&#8243;, all I have to do is write the implementation for that method:</p>
<pre><code>

- (void) tracks_play:(NSString *)inParamID

{

// ...

}

</code></pre>
<p>The web request calls through to this new method without any additional glue code, in this case passing &#8220;1234&#8221; in the single parameter.</p>
<p>(The underscored method signatures aren&#8217;t very Cocoa-ish, but this is actually a plus because I can quickly spot the chunk of the controller that processes a set of requests, and I like that they read just like the URLs. I&#8217;m also currently using a single controller instead of having separate controller objects for the different types of requests, but I may expand that later.)</p>
<p>This convention has also allowed me to simplify all the URLs that Wii Transfer uses. Other examples include &#8220;/covers/search/U2&#8243; or &#8220;/artists/show/5&#8243;. I&#8217;ve eliminated a bunch of code, and it fits nicely with how I serve application resources and the start of a HTML template system.</p>
<p>Could it be taken further? Sure. I remember in the Mac OS 9 days building a web interface for a product using only compiled AppleScript scripts stored in the resource fork. Lately, folks like &#8220;Gus Mueller&#8221;:http://gusmueller.com/blog/ and Adobe&#8217;s Lightroom team have been doing interesting things with &#8220;embedding Lua&#8221;:http://www.sqlabs.net/blog/2006/01/adobe-lightroom-and-lua.html. I don&#8217;t want that level of extensibility yet, but it seems like a logical next generation when I outgrow even this new web architecture in Wii Transfer.</p>
