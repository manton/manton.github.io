The first meeting was at <a href="http://www.opaldivines.com/">Opal Divines</a>. We passed around sketchbooks and discussed art, comics, animation, and how the digital world has effected independent artists. Some people brought laptops, some brought prints. Most everyone sketched.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2003/sketchgroup2.jpg" width="135" height="185" vspace="2" hspace="10" border="1" align="right" alt="Looking"> Rick gave out copies of his comic book, Budget Strips; <a href="http://www.rdta.net/">Justin</a> had his Flash short films on his PowerBook; <a href="http://www.ismaelcavazos.com/">Ismael</a> showed some framed prints inspired by doodles; and John and Jasun both had great sketchbooks. About a dozen people showed up, an incredible mix of talented artists. I&#8217;ve been trying to get in the habit of keeping a sketchbook and drawing more regularly, so it was a big inspiration.</p>

			<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2003/08/i_would_not_feel_so_all_alone.html">John Gruber counters anti-Carbon arguments</a> from Andrew Stone, again:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Apple&#8217;s original plan more or less boiled down to replacing the Mac OS with NextStep; Mac developers had the crazy idea that it should be replaced with a new version of the Mac OS. Apple listened, the plan was revised, and six years later, here we are.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently, no one sent Stone the memo.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The good news is that most of this Carbon vs. Cocoa stuff has died down by now. Developers realize that there are strengths in both APIs.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks I&#8217;ve been experimenting with adding Cocoa functionality to an entirely Carbon app. It turns out this is fairly straight forward. In fact the hardest part was making the move to mach-o and an application package. At that point you can drop NIB files in to the project, and mix and match Objective-C with C++. All using CodeWarrior.</p>
<p>The integration is mostly seamless. For example I have drag-and-drop working between a Data Browser control in a Carbon window and an NSTableView in a Cocoa windows. The Cocoa code knows nothing about the Carbon window and the Carbon code knows nothing about Pasteboards. Another surprise was menu integration: NSTextView properly enables and responds to menu items in my Carbon Edit menu!</p>

			<p>I often subscribe to a weblog because I trust that person&#8217;s opinion on a certain subject. I know that they worked at a company I have respect for, or wrote software that I like, or created some art or film that is interesting.</p>
<p>But many go further than that. They open up another part of their life that in many ways is much more interesting. A great example of that is Jeffrey Veen. Forget web design, his posts on cycling have been great. He also blogs in a pattern that I have come to appreciate: infrequent posts but each one actually says something. Too many bloggers now post 10 times a day, and it&#8217;s all useless stuff. You have to read a week&#8217;s worth of garbage to get something insightful.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Veen on <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000131.html">Pain and Cycling</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I crawled back to the city, wobbling across the Golden Gate into 30mph winds. My vision blurred and a cramp in my hamstring knotted and released with each pedal stroke. When I finally got home,  I was unable to lift my bike up the stairs. I rolled it around to the garage and stumbled into the house. Leslie looked at me and said, &#8216;Oh no.&#8217; I took a 30 second shower and fell into bed with a bowl of pasta.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<a href="../../../2003/07/the_animation_show.html" rel="bookmark">The Animation Show premiere</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Friday night&#8217;s premiere of <a href="http://www.animationshow.com/">The Animation Show</a> here in Austin was a lot of fun. An excellent collection of shorts. Many of them I had never heard of, and most I had never seen.</p>
<p>Afterwards Don Hertzfeldt and Mike Judge took some questions. Here are two quotes from Don:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Really the point of this is to give back to the artists.&#8221;<br />&#8220;We&#8217;ve done this before &#8212; we hope we can help them get through the door.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, he made two points on the purpose of the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>To get good animation to audiences. Not just a few cities but into the midwest and all over the country. Apparently they are booking more shows than is usual for <a href="http://www.spikeandmike.com/">Spike and Mike</a>.</li>
<li>To help artists get their work out there, help them make money. Don feels that short films should be a viable pursuit in themselves, not just as a way to land a feature job at a big studio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other points:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s not a competition. Spike and Mike and The Animation Show can co-exist. Mike Judge pointed out that in the 80s there were several shows (International Tournee, etc). Don remarked that it doesn&#8217;t have to be like the big features, where there can only be one player for a given movie weekend.</li>
<li>Every year there will be a new show, with both brand new shorts and also older classics. New submissions will be considered for the 2004 show.</li>
</ul>
<p>The big surprise in the program was the inclusion of Ward Kimball&#8217;s 1957 film, &#8220;Mars and Beyond.&#8221; Kimball, one of Disney&#8217;s Nine Old Men, passed away earlier this year.</p>
<p>Some more highlights (incomplete list):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nfb.ca/strangeinvaders/">&#8220;Strange Invaders&#8221;</a>, from the National Film Board of Canada</li>
<li><a href="http://www.jade.dti.ne.jp/~yam/">&#8220;Mt.Head&#8221;</a>, a great piece from Japan</li>
<li>&#8220;Cathedral&#8221;, CGI with great backgrounds, really well done</li>
<li>&#8220;Parking&#8221;, Bill Plympton</li>
<li>&#8220;Vincent&#8221;, Tim Burton</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dasrad.com/">&#8220;Das Rad&#8221;</a>, neat idea and well executed</li>
<li>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; and &#8220;Office Space&#8221; by Mike Judge</li>
<li>&#8220;Billy&#8217;s Balloon&#8221; and &#8220;Rejected&#8221;, plus the 3 new shorts for this show by Don Hertzfeldt</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.animationshow.com/">The Animation Show web site</a> now has a complete program list, and a schedule for cities the tour will hit over the next year.</p>

			<p>I meant to blog every day from WWDC, but the network was just too flaky, and all my free time was spent coding. I wrote up a few things and will post them over the next week.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,59189,00.html"><img src="../../../images/2003/starry_night.jpg" width="179" height="155" vspace="2" hspace="10" border="1" align="left" alt="Starry Night"></a> I hoped to feel rested, but I was drained after the conference was over. Slept on the plane back, and a big nap the next day trying to adjust. The church that owns the land behind our house put on an incredible fireworks show Sunday night. It lasted a good 30 minutes, and rivaled any city-sponsored fireworks I&#8217;ve seen. It was even bigger than the same event two years ago. We had just moved into our new house the previous day, and we sat on the back deck with a drink, staring at the sky above our house. It was a great welcome to the neighborhood.</p>

			<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2003/06/you_have_new_mail.html">John Gruber</a>: &#8220;The elephant in the middle of the room, of course, is Apple Mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a while now I have regretted switching to Apple Mail. But this is not unusual, because I have regretted switching to <b>every single email client I have tried</b> since the Eudora days. Let&#8217;s face it &#8212; Eudora&#8217;s ugly, but it was a rock-solid app.</p>
<p>The first big mistake was moving to <a href="http://www.cyberdog.org/">CyberDog</a>. There was a lot to like about that app, and I was a big fan of OpenDoc, but even today I have a bunch of mail stuck in its proprietary formats. I need to boot into Mac OS 8 and extract that stuff one of these days.</p>
<p>Then I moved to Mailsmith. Unfortunately I lost mail due to corrupted databases. I have no idea how to get that stuff out. Even so, the 2.0 release sounds nice, and I&#8217;d be willing to give Mailsmith a another try. I&#8217;m stupid that way.</p>
<p>Back to Apple Mail. If you are ever confused enough to think it&#8217;s a great app, try this: delete a single email message in a folder containing 2-3 thousand emails. On my TiBook, the OS locks for a good 5+ seconds.</p>
<p>The saving grace of Apple Mail is that it is easy (presumably) to get out of it &#8212; they use standard unix mbox files for everything. Thank you Apple.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m at WWDC, and Steve Jobs just demoed the new Apple Mail. Pretty nice stuff, but no mention of performance. I&#8217;ll wait to dump Apple Mail until trying Panther, which I&#8217;ll install on an external drive sometime this week. Or maybe I&#8217;ll just get a <a href="http://www.apple.com/g5/">G5 desktop</a> and not worry about performance anymore.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be a fun week.</p>

			<p>I believe in traditional (2d) animation. But watching Nemo, for a moment I almost believed the hype &#8212; that 2d just can&#8217;t compete with 3d anymore. To remind myself that it&#8217;s not true I looked at the great drawings in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0811839753/mantonorg">Art of Finding Nemo book</a>, and remembered the fish sequence from the original Fantasia. Both mediums are appropriate for their own stories, and any great idea with strong characters can be embraced by audiences. You only have to look at last year&#8217;s successes Lilo &amp; Stitch and Spirited Away as proof. The thing that makes Pixar great is the story artists and the hands-off management, not the render farm.</p>
<p>There will be great 2d films to come, and to be successful they will need to embrace what makes 2d special: drawings. It&#8217;s clear that Disney (the company) has never understood what Walt believed in. <a href="http://www.jimhillmedia.com/legacy/index.htm?../articles/05192003.1.htm~contentFrame">Jim Hill thinks</a> that many top artists, rather than submit to 3d re-training, may leave to build a new traditional animation company, taking over the art form that Disney pioneered.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And &#8212; since WDFA execs now seem genuinely reluctant to greenlight a new traditionally animated feature &#8212; that&#8217;s why many Disney Animation vets are now reportedly talking about &#8216;&#8230; pulling a Bluth.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Don Bluth, tired of the cheap production process compared to the classic Disney films, left the company and took many senior animators with him. They made The Secret of Nihm, and then the financial successful An American Tail.</p>
<p>Although I don&#8217;t know the political climate at the studio, it is clear that there was a division among the animators, and Bluth left many young recruits behind. One of them, <a href="http://www.animated-movies.net/GlenKeane.html">Glen Keane</a>, is among the most respected animators in the business. He has supervised the characters Ariel, Beast, Alladin, Pocahontas, Tarzan, and Long John Silver. Now he wants to direct Rapunzel with charcoal animation, or 2d with 3d hair, but the project is being forced into an all-CG production.</p>
<p>Getting back to Jim Hill&#8217;s point, would Glen leave rather than make a completely CG film? Maybe not. Ironically, he worked closely with John Lasseter before Lasseter left for Pixar, and then closely with Eric Daniels on the computer/traditional hybrid Long John Silver in Treasure Planet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.witoldriedel.com/MT/archives/001554.shtml">Witold Riedel</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The writers at Pixar are somehow always able to think outside of one age group and so I think that even if Pixar decided to make movies with paper-napkin-puppets exclusively, they would still be able to turn them into wonderful classics. Their storytelling sits at the beginning and in the centre of the process and this really shows.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			<p>It&#8217;s appropriate that I&#8217;m in a coding frenzy for the next few weeks. <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> e-ticket in hand, and at work we go GM on a major version of our software just a week before the conference.</p>
<p>This will be my fifth WWDC, and I think it will be a good one. It&#8217;s great to work for a company committed to this conference. Lots of mysterious TBA sessions, which probably means they will cover new Panther technology. Unfortunately the session map puts some of the good Carbon sessions on the last day. Every WWDC I have to wonder if Apple will fully support Carbon development.</p>
<p>The code I&#8217;m working on now will be the last for Mac OS 9. Since I use a custom C++ framework, we&#8217;ve been expanding it over the last few months. Wrappers for Carbon Timers, network transfer, and QuickTime. OS X-specific stuff, like sheets. More advanced UI controls, custom buttons, and a search box. A minimal toolbar class, which looks like the OS X toolbar at first glance, but works on OS 9 and doesn&#8217;t support customization.</p>
<p>When we finally say goodbye to OS 9, some of this code can be replaced. WWDC is a good turning point. Without worrying about shipping a product, I can dive into the new Carbon HIToolbox APIs. And Cocoa. Based on what Apple says at the conference I will decide whether moving to a hybrid Carbon/Cocoa app is the way to go.</p>
<p>It should be fun.</p>

			<p>The Matrix double-feature last night was fun (thanks <a href="http://www.damon.to/blog/">Damon</a>). Five hours of movies and food, yikes. I enjoyed the movie, and my only complaint was when they started replacing Keanu with a CG character in some of the fight scenes. It started to look more like a video game then a film, but given the nature of the Matrix world, maybe that was the point.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/05/030515the_matrix_r.html">Kottke was also annoyed</a> by the effects: &#8220;The completely computer-generated effects (e.g. in the Neo vs. 100 Agent Smiths fight) looked, well, completely computer-generated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before and between the features they screened 3 of the new <a href="http://www.intothematrix.com/">Animatrix shorts</a>. I had seen part of one online, but was waiting until the DVD came out so I could watch them all. Now I&#8217;m not so sure. I&#8217;ll probably still get the DVD, but I hope the subject matter in the other shorts is better than The Second Renaissance. Not that it was bad &#8212; it was brilliantly done, with a great blend of CG and hand-drawn &#8212; but it sure was a depressing little film. Sort of like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006HAWP/mantonorg">Grave of the Fireflies</a>: a beautiful and moving film, but not something I want to watch over and over.</p>

			<p>At SXSW I told Mena Trott that RSS 1.0 was dead or dying, because it was too complicated. Turns out I was partially wrong &#8212; it&#8217;s very much alive, but perhaps only because it&#8217;s the default in Movable Type. Six Apart has signed up for the semantic web vision, and they are tool builders so they look for ways to make their products spit out semantic goodness.</p>
<p>I used to feel the same way. I wanted to build tools to help web designers use meta data effectively, provide meaningful structure to their site, put their template-driven pages in a database, and a whole host of other tricks that in 1995 seemed like noble work. I&#8217;m too tired for that now. I just want to use the web, and build good software, and do a few other things.</p>
<p>You reach a point where you no longer want to tinker with things that work. Could RSS 2.0 be better? Sure, but so could any number of standards. You need stability to build new tools on top of.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1393.html">The RSS profile discussion</a> on Sam Ruby&#8217;s blog makes me want to set fire to my computer. As do all the competing approaches for <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1299.html">putting HTML into RSS</a>.</p>
<p>Ben Trott chimes in with <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2003/05/a_proposal_rss_.shtml">&#8220;RSS for Weblogs&#8221;</a>. I still think there&#8217;s a division in the RSS community between people that want a simple format and people that want to evolve it, embracing RDF and a handful of upcoming weblog-related specs. As such, the battle for RSS standards is going to suck. Of course maybe I&#8217;m wrong, maybe this work does need to happen, to &#8220;finish&#8221; RSS. To all involved, good luck!</p>
<p>&lt;a href=&#8221;http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/24/zeldman_has_an_rss_feed.html</p>
<p>&#8220;>Mark Pilgrim</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Zeldman maintains this feed by hand, like he maintains the rest of his site. Let&#8217;s keep this in mind the next time someone claims that it&#8217;s OK for a data format to be complex because it&#8217;ll only ever be produced and consumed by machines.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the TypePad announcements comes word that they will be pushing FOAF (friend of a friend). According to the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/news/0,12597,942024,00.html">Guardian article</a>, &#8220;instantly taking an experimental standard and taking it to the mainstream.&#8221; Is that a good thing?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget the little guy who has to code this stuff by hand. And don&#8217;t push formats that no one wants. Where possible, give choices. When a product takes off like Movable Type has, the formats that it spits out have a big influence.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll end with a few RDF articles. Hopefully this will be my last blog post about blogs for a while.</p>
<p>IT World: <a href="http://www.itworld.com/nl/ebiz_ent/03182003/">&#8220;RDF and other monkey wrenches&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Jon Udell, &lt;a href=&#8221;<a href="http://webservices.xml.com/pub/a/ws/2003/04/15/semanticblog.html">The Semantic Blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But we&#8217;d hate to be saddled with the rigorous data preparation that the Safari production teams slog through. That&#8217;s the Semantic Web dilemma in a nutshell. Where&#8217;s the sweet spot? How can we marry spontaneity and structure? Recent trends in blogspace, plus emerging XML-savvy databases suggest a way forward.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			<p>A few weeks ago <a href="http://arstechnica.com/paedia/f/finder/finder-1.html">John Siracusa wrote a great summary of the Finder</a>, with specifics on why the OS X Finder is a step back from the OS 9 Finder. In the second half he provides suggestions for improvement that return what was good about the old Finder, plus a general architecture and guidelines for adding features.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.asktog.com/columns/035SquanAdv.html">Tog writes that Apple has been squandering the advantage</a> it used to have.

<blockquote><p>&#8220;According to the patent, piles comprise collections of documents represented graphically in stacks.  Users can browse the &#8220;piled&#8221; documents dynamically by pointing at them with the cursor; the filing system can then divide a pile into subpiles based on each document&#8217;s content.

			<p>There&#8217;s an opportunity for Ranchero if they act soon. We are still in the early stages of RSS readers and aggregators, both web-based and desktop apps. Over the next year, we are going to see even more tools for managing weblog subscriptions and discovering new blogs.</p>
<p>&lt;a href=&#8221;http://www.dashes.com/anil/index.php?archives/005631.php</p>
<p>&#8220;>Anil Dash wants</a> to follow many, many weblogs:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The second idea that I really believe in, despite the fact that nearly everyone who heard it thought I was either being crazy or facetious, was that in 2 or 3 years, many of us will be reading 10,000 weblogs. It&#8217;s a hard statement to justify literally unless you factor in how software and platforms are going to evolve.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>At SXSW, he made the comparison to the New York Times. Instead of hundreds of writers and editors at a newspaper, you have thousands of bloggers focused on topics they know something about, and smart software that brings it all together.</p>
<p>Impossible today. At least two things are needed: Better ways to discover new blogs, using blogrolls and <a href="http://rdfweb.org/foaf/">FOAF</a>-like formats to connect bloggers that share common interests; and filtering systems that allow unimportant entries to be hidden, or special topics flagged and brought to your attention.</p>
<p>Back to NetNewsWire. It has a good UI, it&#8217;s built on a nice database (<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>), it knows network stuff and RSS, and it will soon integrate a good rendering engine (<a href="http://developer.apple.com/darwin/projects/webcore/">WebKit</a>). Why not use that infrastructure to build other tools on. Plug-ins could hook into the application at different levels, such as filtering incoming RSS feeds, providing search services, or making changes to the subscription list. NetNewsWire has great AppleScript support, but this would go a step beyond that.</p>
<p>Now would be a great time for Ranchero to start thinking about this, before everyone starts writing their own aggregator. The last thing I want is 10 applications with incomplete features. I&#8217;d rather have a couple good ones that are compatible and can be extended.</p>

<p>The big news for me &#8212; more than Michael Moore&#8217;s rant, or Adrien Brody&#8217;s win for The Pianist &#8212; was that Spirited Away beat out Lilo &amp; Stitch for Best Animated Feature. Now comes word that Disney will keep its promise to <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/getarticle.pl5?nn20030326b1.htm">re-release Spirited Away to 800 theaters this week</a>.

			<p>After SXSW I made a point to seek out new blogs. One is Micah Alpern, <a href="http://www.alpern.org/weblog/2003/03/19.html#a618">who writes about Marissa Mayer&#8217;s talk</a>, &#8220;The How and Why of Google UI&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Marissa is involved in UI, Usability, and Project Management at Google so she&#8217;s had a big effect on how Google.com has evolved. It was an insightful talk with great examples of how a user centered design processes can lead to successful products.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Also on the Google UI front today, <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000120.php">37signals enhances Google&#8217;s default design</a> by exposing similar search terms and their hit counts:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our idea for 37BetterGoogle was to go beyond Google&#8217;s standard search and offer alternatives based on the words you originally entered. By searching for different forms of the same words and comparing those results to your initial query, Google does the legwork for you, helping you see results you may never have discovered the first time around.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, 37signals has placed the entire design into the public domain using a Creative Commons license, essentially giving the idea to Google free of charge. Good for them.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Compare RSS with scriptingNews format, which is richer, it includes enough information to do an elegant syndication-based search engine (coming later today). Netscape&#8217;s and Slashdot&#8217;s formats are basically equivalent, neither is as rich as our format.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>At some point Dave stopped evangelizing the <a href="http://my.userland.com/stories/storyReader$11">scriptingNews format</a>, but Userland tools still support it. Manila&#8217;s RSS output is actually often incomplete compared to the scriptingNews version. This annoyed me enough with <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Hack the Planet</a> that I wrote a little Python script to convert scriptingNews to RSS. (NetNewsWire doesn&#8217;t support scriptingNews subscriptions.)</p>
<p>I had never coded in Python before, but I&#8217;ve read a little from Learning Python and <a href="http://www.diveintopython.org/">Dive into Python</a>. Even so, the script is mostly an unenlightened mess. The usual disclaimers apply: do whatever you want with it, don&#8217;t blame me, feel free to send improvements back to me, etc.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running it from cron on my Mac OS X laptop with <code>curl -s http://wmf.editthispage.com/xml/scriptingNews2.xml | python sn2rss.py > wmf_rss.xml</code>, and then I point NetNewsWire at the local generated file.</p>
<p>You can download it here: <a href="../../../software/downloads/sn2rss.py.html">sn2rss.py.txt</a>.</p>
<p>For those wondering why I didn&#8217;t just use XSLT, I did try that first. But doing string replaces didn&#8217;t seem to be available in the old version of <a href="http://www.blnz.com/xt/">XT</a> I was testing with.</p>
<p>A final warning: Python&#8217;s XML parser on Mac OS X 10.2 is broken. I had to install <a href="http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/">PyXML</a>, which also had a broken install script that required tweaking. Too bad I threw away my changes.</p>

			<p>Macromedia is fortunate to have two things going for it: <a href="http://www.klynch.com/">Kevin Lynch</a>, who seems like a smart guy, and Dreamweaver, which won&#8217;t let the company forget about HTML.</p>
<p>My expectations were very low for the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/special/progress_report/">Macromedia.com beta report</a>, but truthfully there is some good stuff in there. Macromedia will not be successful pushing their Rich Internet Application strategy without educating customers when to use Flash, when to stick with HTML and core web technologies, and when to combine both. The report <em>feels</em> honest. Here&#8217;s the take-home point:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Content and applications should coexist. The most successful sites will walk the delicate balance of using Macromedia Flash and HTML together to create engaging, effective experiences.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/">Anil Dash</a> said at SXSW, about why audio blogs suck: &#8220;They break the web to me in all the ways Flash does.&#8221; How does Flash break the web? Used poorly, it&#8217;s a glorified JPEG &#8212; no links, no URIs, no back/forward button in the browser, no user control. Ironically, Macromedia was held up as a good example in Jesse James Garrett&#8217;s <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000058.php">user-centered URL design essay</a>, and that URL consistency remains on the new site. Obviously there are people at Macromedia who get it. When the report says &#8220;Internally, there was a lot of debate about the home page&#8221;, you can read between the lines and imagine the different camps fighting it out in meetings.</p>
<p>I had a great lunch conversation with Trei Brundrett of <a href="http://www.handwire.com/">Handwire</a> last week about Flash vs. traditional web applications. He had experimented with a completely Flash front-end for a previously web-based content management system, with disappointing results (slow load times and decreased usability). Other web developers that go down this path might also find themselves questioning their decision, depending on the project. There are small studios producing entire animated television series using Flash! You have to wonder if the same tool is also appropriate for building software user interfaces.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see Macromedia eating their own dog food. I wonder if it will change their rhetoric on Rich Internet Applications a year from now.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>After the panel Tuesday I commented to <a href="http://dollarshort.org/">Mena</a> that TrackBack is still sort of Movable Type-only and maybe needs simplifying if it is to gain acceptance in other tools. Turns out I was wrong, in part. TrackBack is a pretty good specification. As far as how pinging works, it&#8217;s about simple as it could be.</p>
<p>I started implementing TrackBacks for my blog tonight. I&#8217;m using Radio Userland, which has it&#8217;s own centralized comment system that I don&#8217;t use. For a couple of reasons I prefer the idea of TrackBack. It adds a little bit of accountability (you need your own weblog), and also allows the poster more control over his or her own comments.</p>
<p>However, not everyone knows how to issue TrackBack pings, which is really the part about the system that needs some usability help. So I also want to eventually add support for detecting in-bound links using referrers, which would be gathered into the same database and co-exist alongside TrackBacks. All the coding will be in PHP, included as necessary from the static HTML files that Radio generates.</p>
<p>Another one of my goals is to have simple TrackBack Ping URLs. My first idea here was to use the permalink itself, but right now I think I&#8217;ll use a variation like /trackback/2003/03/15. When I have it working, I&#8217;ll add the URL below each post.</p>
<p>Matt Haughey is also doing <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archives.blah/006625">interesting things with TrackBack</a>: &#8220;So Winamp is now sending trackbacks to my blog, and every time a new song comes on, a new ping goes out, and my site changes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this year <a href="http://www.mplode.com/tima/archives/000206.html">Timothy Appnel suggested changes</a> for the next generation to TrackBack.</p>

			<p>SXSW has wrapped up for me, although many others will still be out partying long after I post this. I&#8217;ve had the chance to meet some interesting people. Some of them I have names and URLs for, some just faces and conversations.</p>
<p>The Future of Blogging panel was good. <a href="http://tantek.com/log/">Tantek &Ccedil;elik</a> asked a question about the complexity of <a href="http://rdfweb.org/foaf/">Friend of a Friend</a> (FOAF), and whether a more human-readable/writable format was needed. The question was not well received by the panel, which took the view that tools (like Movable Type) will be able to hide the sometimes messy details from the user.</p>
<p>But remember that if nothing else, the weblog movement has proved that it is the simple formats that will be successful. RSS 1.0 (RDF-based) was interesting, but it&#8217;s dead, and it&#8217;s dead because it was too complicated. Similar situation with XML-RPC vs. SOAP. To get to the point of having great tools that hide the protocols, you need to go through a period of hand-coding. The easier a spec is to understand and implement, the more people will adopt it, the more momentum it will have, and the more tools that can build on it.</p>
<p>I took a bunch of notes in some of the more interesting sessions. Originally I had planned on posting them to the <a href="http://www.sxswblog.com/exchange.asp">SXSWblog Notes Exchange</a>, but alone their value is questionable; they are so interspersed with my own thoughts which need more exploration. Over the next few days I&#8217;ll unravel them and post my view on the topics that have threaded through the conference.</p>
<p>Justin Hall on &lt;a href=&#8221;http://links.net/daze/03/03/03/inlining_notegiving.html</p>
<p>&#8220;>note taking</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now that I&#8217;m practicing more professional journalism, I see less value in a straight recitations of events. I want a summary, with key glowing thoughts brought out, hyperlinked and put in context. Notes are good for article building, but they don&#8217;t make much of an article in and of themselves.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
