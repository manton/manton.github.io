			<p>The private park behind our house is owned by a local church, and they aren&#8217;t afraid to spend money on fireworks every year. Last week was probably the best show yet. We brought some chairs out to the sidewalk to get a good view over our trees. Our neighbors were doing hotdogs and marshmallows in their front yard and also provided sparklers. Fun times.</p>
<p>I took some cheap video with my digital camera. Some frames from it are below. It was so close overhead that the paper remnants from the fireworks were falling in the street and in the yard.</p>

			<p>Yesterday I finally arrived back in Austin after 8 days in California. Last weekend started off with a trip to Los Angeles, where I met up with my old friend Justin and attended &#8220;2D Expo&#8221;, a conference sponsored by <a href="http://www.asifa-hollywood.org/">ASIFA-Hollywood</a> for traditional animators. The conference was great, and I left feeling pretty energized. There is an opportunity right now for traditional animation to leave its Disney roots and break new ground. I met some great people and had fun talking about the industry and what comes next. Hope to be back to the LA area one of these days.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, Justin picked me up from Burbank and we drove north on highway 1, which hugs the coastline all the way to San Francisco. We stopped at a few random scenic points, a nice restaurant overlooking the water, and at Big Sur. A healthy couple mile walk through Chinatown and dinner at Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf rounded out the evening.</p>
<p><center><img src="../../../images/2004/highway_1.jpg" width="400" height="239" alt="Highway 1" border="1"></center></p>
<p>Monday through Friday was Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">World Wide Developer Conference</a>. At work we sent 5 people, so we had pretty good coverage of all the interesting sessions. As usual the keynote was not to be missed. I&#8217;ve yet to see a Steve Jobs&#8217; demo that wasn&#8217;t effective. The first time I saw him was the Macworld Expo after he came back to Apple (but before he took over), and he even managed to make a NeXTSTEP demo look impressive. Contrary to what many people believed at the introduction to Mac OS X, Apple&#8217;s new OS is not just NeXT-based; it&#8217;s about a third NeXT, a third classic Mac OS, and a third something entirely new. That last third really shines in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">Tiger</a>.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve routinely been working past midnight the last couple of weeks as we make a final push to get our software finished. Although it&#8217;s just coincidence that we usually ship right before WWDC, it reminds me of the old days of trying to get betas ready to demo before Macworld Expo or one of the other yearly conferences.</p>
<p>I took a break from that on Sunday, my third Father&#8217;s Day. Big breakfast with the family, mowing the lawn with some iPod tunes, putting together a baby crib, lunch, then headed down to the Austin Sketch Group meeting and talked animated films and art while sipping a chocolate coffee drink which had entirely too much caffeine in it. <a href="http://www.flatblackfilms.com/">Bob Sabiston</a> came by to recruit folks for Richard Linklater&#8217;s upcoming film, A Scanner Darkly (based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679736654/mantonorg">Philip K. Dick book</a>). It will employ the same rotoscope technique used for <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/waking_life.html">Waking Life</a>, but perhaps favoring a more consistent style rather than the individual inventiveness of that previous film. Should be fun to see the result, and in the wake of Shrek 2 box office numbers it&#8217;s good to see some investment in creative, lower-budget animated films.</p>

			<p>I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;m a big comic book person anymore, at least not the way I was as a kid, eagerly awaiting the weekly shipment of comics to the local shop. Recently I&#8217;ve read books like <a href="../../../2003/01/understanding_comics.html">Understanding Comics</a> that helped awaken my appreciation for the form. There are some good things happening in the comics world, too, especially from independent artists. The Internet is changing distribution and how artists connect with readers, of course.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last week Apple released the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/AppleSWDesign/">Apple Software Design Guidelines document</a>. I&#8217;ve only just skimmed it, but it looks like the best document from Apple in years.</p>
<p>Take this little bit of advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When saving files of your own document types, include a file type, creator type, and filename extension for your file. It is best to include all three of these identifiers to ensure maximum compatibility with other platforms.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, yeah. Finally some solid, practical recommendations from Apple that take into account the whole system, not a narrow set of APIs.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago I read the Microsoft article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnwui/html/iuiguidelines.asp?frame=true">&#8220;Inductive User Interface Guidelines&#8221;</a>. The principles from the document showed up extensively in Windows XP and will be even more prevalent in Longhorn as Microsoft attempts to cloud the difference between web and traditional applications. It struck me as an interesting approach, one that clearly has benefits for some types of users and some applications. I wrote about it a little last year in a post called <a href="../../../2003/02/inductive_vs.html">&#8220;Inductive vs rich user interface design&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Now take that feedback in the context of <a href="http://www.asktog.com/basics/firstPrinciples.html">this article from AskTog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Usability and learnability are not mutually exclusive. First, decide which is the most important; then attack both with vigor. Ease of learning automatically coming at the expense of ease of use is a myth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple has almost completely ignored the user interface principles that Microsoft is pushing. Here&#8217;s a quote from the new Apple design guidelines document:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Allow the user, not the computer, to initiate and control actions. Some applications attempt to assist the user by offering only those alternatives deemed good for the user or by protecting the user from having to make detailed decisions. This approach mistakenly puts the computer, not the user, in control.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Apple document doesn&#8217;t contain anything &#8220;new&#8221;, but it&#8217;s a great set of principles and suggestions gathered from other sources and put in a succinct format. The new Apple is not without it&#8217;s recent user interface stumbles, but it&#8217;s nice to know that overall they have the best grasp of the big design picture that they&#8217;ve ever had.</p>

			<p>If you&#8217;d have asked me last week whether I would see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0350028/">Raising Helen</a> on opening night, I&#8217;d have given you a puzzled look and maybe said something about looking forward to Harry Potter. But that was before I realized that the short film <a href="http://www.animationartconservation.com/lorenzo.html">Lorenzo</a> will be shown before that new Kate Hudson flick.</p>
<p>Lorenzo makes extensive use of computers but is still a traditionally animated film. I was immediately captured by the visuals of this film since I first saw stills and clips from it. In the age of Pepsi commercials, trailers, and &#8220;The Twenty&#8221;, theatrical short films are all but dead. I jump at the chance to see one, especially one as visually innovative as Lorenzo.</p>
<p>A technical summary of the animation process for Lorenzo can be found in this <a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~mario/npr/projects/sigg03/lec8/hand_1.pdf">PDF from a Siggraph lecture</a>. Also check out <a href="http://vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&amp;code=0e819731&amp;atype=articles&amp;id=2042">this article from VFXWorld</a>.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m listening to track 3 of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000095J94/mantonorg">Finding Nemo soundtrack</a> on repeat. Something very soothing about that opening music.</p>
<p>I finally got to watch the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001IN0MQ/mantonorg">Triplets of Belleville DVD</a> special features, and I only wish there was more (full director&#8217;s commentary would be nice). When I left the theater last month, there was no question in my mind but that Sylvain Chomet in a brilliant artist and director. The death of 2d animation in Hollywood is a blessing in disguise. Small, modest-budget, completely artist-driven productions could flourish right now. New and different stories could be successful in a way that was impossible when Disney owned the screen in the 1990s.</p>
<p>From an <a href="http://www.animwatch.com/Feature04-Triplets.shtml">AnimWatch interview with Evgeni Tomov</a>, the Triplets of Belleville art director:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Animation has its charm and qualities. It delivers different aesthetic and emotional experience. It is not just about telling a story the fastest and the cheapest way. The Triplets would have not been nearly as interesting and unique if it was a live action film. The hand made, drawn feel that comes from the screen, the stylization of the characters (you can not find actors with this kind of bizarre physics) resonate quite well with the equally bizarre story we are witnessing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Think big and keep drawing.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.flowdelic.org/">Mason Hale</a> of frog design started a weblog last week, and already he&#8217;s got some great posts and discussion. Mason and I worked together around 1995. You know, back when the Internet was still fun.</p>
<p>At the time, Mason had been building a CGI framework inside Frontier. This coincided with Frontier&#8217;s time as a free application and helped jump start Dave Winer&#8217;s push to build Internet-related applications around Frontier. I built a number of web applications in Frontier, wrote some <a href="../../../archive/idiom/mactivity_presentation/index.html">cool un-shipped software</a> that used an embedded Frontier database, and even helped host and maintain the Frontier-Talk mailing list for a time. After a few years, Frontier and I went our separate ways. (Bonus in the previous link: The web server plug-in mentioned in the slides from 1996 was called Rendezvous.)</p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/05/17#asGoodATimeAsAny">Dave Winer announced</a> that the Frontier kernel&#8217;s source code will be released for the first time. This is a really interesting move and, like all good ideas, probably could have had more of an impact if done earlier. AppleScript dominates desktop automation now, but a focused set of Frontier tools could still be very useful. I don&#8217;t think this effort will fizzle like the <a href="http://macbird.userland.com/">MacBird release</a> did, in part because Frontier is already Carbonized (see <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2842">Brent&#8217;s comments about that</a>) and in use by developers.</p>
<p>Mason and I still bump into each other every once in a while, but now it&#8217;s more as parents than as geeks. To Dave, Mason, Brent, <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Wes</a>, and everyone else that contributed to Frontier&#8217;s history: congrats.</p>

			<p>Not 5 minutes after I posted <a href="../../../2004/05/the_itunes.html">yesterday&#8217;s iTunes piece</a>, <a href="http://www.irelan.net/becoming/">Ryan</a> tells me I&#8217;m asking for too much. &#8220;My fear is that too many features will render iTunes a useless and unusable app,&#8221; he writes, and he&#8217;s absolutely right to be concerned.</p>
<p>I will admit that my list contains some less-than-great ideas, only loosely organized around the idea of discovering new music (something I&#8217;ve been trying to do lately). I do think RSS support would be interesting, though, because it would allow iMix-like functionality but distributed across anyone&#8217;s web site and created using any software.</p>
<p>The important point, I guess, is that iTunes still has room to grow, and that&#8217;s not by accident. Smart Playlists and Party Shuffle are two examples of great features that fit well inside the existing interface.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://otterlearn.typepad.com/blogkathleen/2004/05/my_itunes_playl.html">Kathleen wants something similar with RSS</a>, but sort of the other way around: RSS generated from the published iMixes.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s no secret that iTunes is one of Apple&#8217;s best apps. Of all the iApps, iTunes remains the only one I have no critical feature requests for. With version 4.5, Apple adds to what was already a solid app, and they continue to do so in a way that fits well inside the two foundation pieces they&#8217;ve created: the basic music library interface and the iTunes Music Store.</p>
<p>I noticed the other day that they now have trailers and music videos inside of iTunes. The investment they made in the old <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/">trailers site</a> was initially just to showcase QuickTime, but it ties perfectly in with the store soundtrack collection.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next? Here are some more random ideas for the iTunes platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Movie showtimes.</b> Can they give this a good/fast UI? Sherlock 2 isn&#8217;t so bad, but I never have the app running. iTunes is always there.</li>
<li><b>Music magazine.</b> Both original articles and syndicated articles from major magazines and even weblogs.</li>
<li><b>RSS reader.</b> What app couldn&#8217;t use a little RSS? I&#8217;d like music feeds (which <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/MRSS/rssGenerator">Apple already provides</a>) directly in iTunes instead of NetNewsWire. Double-click a news item to hear a song preview, of course.</li>
<li><b>Recommendations from library.</b> This has been suggested before: An option to feed local playlists to iTMS servers to improve recommendations. This is different than publicly shared iMixes, but maybe could be an extension of that feature.</li>
<li><b>Amazon integration for CDs.</b> Not all music is available in iTMS. I&#8217;d like a simple Amazon interface off of their search results, for those times I can&#8217;t find what I&#8217;m looking for in iTMS.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2004-04-14.22:22">&#8220;What if Mail.app were like iTunes?&#8221;</a>, Rui Carmo rattles off a dozen features that would be nice in Mail, but he only hints at the real question. What makes iTunes such a great app? Clearly some of it is interface design. Then there&#8217;s the incredible speed, which also affects usability. iTunes is the only iApp still written in Carbon, is that a relevant distinction? Does iTunes (because of the music store and iPod) simply get more resources within Apple? Maybe. But even with all of these things, you can&#8217;t continue to build and ship a great app without a smart team and tight integration between related groups (UI, WebObjects, etc), and ultimately I think that&#8217;s what makes any product a success.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see what the iTunes folks come up with for 5.0.</p>

			<p>There has been a fascinating discussion among information architects and web designers about the usefulness of breadcrumb trails. Mark Hurst of Good Experience talks about <a href="http://www.goodexperience.com/columns/04/0325.pp.html">the page paradigm</a>, Peter Merholz <a href="http://www.peterme.com/archives/000296.html">mostly disagrees</a>, and Christine Wodtke <a href="http://www.eleganthack.com/archives/003852.html">offers her two cents</a>. Here&#8217;s part of what Steve Krug had to say about the topic in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789723107/mantonorg">&#8220;Don&#8217;t Make Me Think&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For most sites, I don&#8217;t think Breadcrumbs <i>alone</i> are a good navigation scheme. They&#8217;re not a good replacement for showing at least the top two layers of the hierarchy, because they don&#8217;t reveal enough. They give you a view, but it&#8217;s like a view with blinders. It&#8217;s not that you can&#8217;t make your way around using just Breadcrumbs. It&#8217;s that they&#8217;re not a good way to <i>present</i> most sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get my wrong. Done right, Breadcrumbs are self-explanatory, they don&#8217;t take up much room, and they provide a convenient, consistent way to do two of the things you need to do most often: back up a level or go Home.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark might argue that &#8220;back up a level&#8221; is more often accomplished with the browser&#8217;s back button, eliminating one of the points above. (Although the book actually has a whole chapter on this stuff, to be fair to Mr. Krug.)</p>
<p>Yesterday, Andrei Herasimchuk wrote that <a href="http://www.designbyfire.com/000075.html">navigation doesn&#8217;t actually exist</a>. Instead, he argues, there are only ways of finding things, and some of them have nothing to do with conveying the user&#8217;s position. He does a good job of framing the different needs of large collections of web pages vs. web applications. Clearly there is a &#8220;where am I&#8221; to hierarchical sets of data. Users feel as if they are moving between pages that have relationships, and making those relationships clear in the interface (via category lists or breadcrumb trials) minimizes how much the user is required to think about where they are, and how to get someplace else.</p>
<p>Amazon, on the other hand, is a web application. While there are clear navigation elements (browsing category pages, or using the primary navigation to jump between books and DVDs), most of the time the user doesn&#8217;t get lost because they aren&#8217;t moving. Instead of saying &#8220;I am on the search results page&#8221;, they might say &#8220;I am searching for a book&#8221;. The experience is dominated with tasks: &#8220;I&#8217;m adding something to my shopping cart&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m buying this book&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m changing my credit card information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or maybe they are just randomly clicking on featured products. It all feels effortless to the user because Amazon has done such a great job with their search and recommendation system.</p>
<p>Brenda Laurel gave an interesting keynote address at SXSW Interactive this year, one which I have trouble summarizing in any meaningful way, and thankfully has nothing to do with this discussion. But a dozen years earlier, she edited a compilation of essays on user interface design from the perspective of the teams at Apple. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201517973/mantonorg">&#8220;The Art of Human-Computer Interface Design&#8221;</a>, and one essay by Abigail Sellen and Anne Nicol hits to the heart of this issue of navigation. Here&#8217;s a snippet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The number of questions concerning navigation is very much application-dependent. Typically they arise most frequently with applications that are structurally complex and that contain a large amount of information. Hypertext-based software is one obvious example; hierarchically structured systems are another. Users tend to make heavy use of spacial metaphors: they report feeling &#8216;lost,&#8217; speak of going &#8216;up&#8217; and &#8216;down&#8217; between levels or going &#8216;in&#8217; and &#8216;out&#8217; of situations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users often spontaneously construct spacial mental models or mental &#8216;maps&#8217; in order to move easily from one context to another. This has obvious implications for design. Reducing the memory lead on the user is one benefit of making these mental &#8216;maps&#8217; explicit. Users can refer to the map instead of trying to retrieve information from memory to tell them &#8216;where they are.&#8217; Another benefit is that a map can form the basis of a mental model on which the user relies to infer how to get from point A to point B without having to keep in mind a set of procedures for navigation. Thus, by exploiting spatial metaphors and allowing the user to make the inference, designers can help users avoid having to ask the question, &#8216;How do I get from point A to point B?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good points to think about. Instead of attempting to wrap this up with some insightful comment, I&#8217;m going to go build stuff.</p>

			<p>A few loosely connected weblog posts I read today&#8230;</p>
<p>John Gruber, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/04/spray_on_usability">&#8220;Ronco Spray-On Usability&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;UI development <i>is</i> the hard part. And it&#8217;s not the last step, it&#8217;s the first step. In my estimation, the difference between:</p>
<ul>
<li>software that performs function X; and</li>
<li>software that performs function X, with an intuitive well-designed user interface</li>
</ul>
<p>isn&#8217;t just a little bit of extra work. It&#8217;s not even twice the work. It&#8217;s an entire <i>order of magnitude</i> more work. Developing software with a good UI requires both aptitude and a lot of hard work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Rick Roe, <a href="http://rick.icons.cx/index.php">&#8220;The Good, the Bad, and the Tog&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The whole point of graphical user interfaces is that they balance efficiency with intuitiveness. An intuitive interface may make some tasks take longer to complete than they could in an interface designed for maximum efficiency, but you can learn it on the spot instead of having to take time digging through documentation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Andre Torrez, <a href="http://torrez.org/archives/000300.php">&#8220;Even You Can Do It&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Stop talking about it an just build it. Don&#8217;t make it too complicated. Don&#8217;t spend so much time planning on events that will never happen. Programmers, good programmers, are known for over-engineering to save time later down the road. The problem is that you can over-engineer yourself out of wanting to do the site.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			<p>After two years of using Radio Userland, I decided to migrate this weblog to Movable Type. I wrote a UserTalk script to export my data for importing into Movable Type, and everything went about as well as could be expected. I&#8217;m making small tweaks to the design, and I added some category pages (still filing old posts in the appropriate categories, since that wasn&#8217;t preserved in the migration). Otherwise it&#8217;s the same site for now. I originally purchased Radio thinking I would customize it, having done a fair bit of Frontier programming <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/credits#may1996Frontier40mac">back in the day</a>. I haven&#8217;t had time, so for now I&#8217;ll give Movable Type a try.</p>
<p>The Six Apart folks have something interesting planned for weblog comments, sort of a single sign-on system with (presumably) a central user registration server. More information is up at <a href="http://www.typekey.com/">TypeKey.com</a>. It will be interesting to see how open their system is, and what other services could potentially be build on top of it.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The last day of SXSW tends to be less about substance and more about winding down after the long weekend and leaving on a positive note. In the morning I listened to Gabriel Jeffrey talk about his success with <a href="http://grouphug.us/">Group Hug</a>. It was a fun session. He is also doing some interesting things with <a href="http://uigui.com/log/">his weblog</a>, such as linking each person&#8217;s name in the comments to a Wiki page. The other hilarious panel of the day was about online dating. The mix of backgrounds among the panelists made for a lively session, and with the tension between the panelists, topped off when Jonathon Abrams (Friendster) tried to hook up with fellow panelist Courtney Johnson (Tickle), you had to wonder if it was all an act. Somehow Lane Becker kept it all together.</p>
<p>The session by Jason Fried of 37signals was the exception to the above. For readers of their weblog, <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a>, the content was familiar. It was a more formal presentation than their game show session from two years ago. I had to leave halfway through, but picked up good notes from <a href="http://www.damon.to/">Damon</a> and the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/presentations/">full slideshow is now online</a>. Also check out the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/book/">sample chapter</a> from their new book.</p>
<p>Jason just posted <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000600.php">some thoughts on the conference</a>, specifically challenging the dominance of CSS and Web Standards this year.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s way too much talk about CSS and XHTML and Standards and Accessibility and not enough talk about <b>people</b>. CSS and Standards Compliant Code are just tools &#8212; you have to know what to build with these tools. Great, I&#8217;m glad your UI doesn&#8217;t use tables. So what? Who cares if it <i>still</i> doesn&#8217;t let people achieve their goals. Web standards are great, but people&#8217;s own standards include getting things done (and that&#8217;s <i>still</i> too hard to do online).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree 100%, and it&#8217;s something I joked about in <a href="../../../2004/03/15.html">my last post</a>. I made the point more fiercely in an early draft of my day 1 post, but ended up editing it out. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading the comments on Jason&#8217;s post, and the other blog posts that will fall out from it.</p>

			<p>Weather changes. The first two days of SXSW were marked with light rain, but today was a beautiful day. Leaving the EFF party tonight, we saw lightning off in the distance. Now, as I write this back at my house, a thunderstorm is passing overhead. A hard rain fell. Lightning flashes and a lingering thunder echoes as it continues eastward.</p>
<p>Several very good sessions today, including an excellent afternoon session by Jeffrey Veen on user-centered design and the <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/">Adaptive Path</a> process. The morning was back-to-back CSS panels. Nothing particularly new was discussed in those, but I found it interesting to hear how the different designers represented on the panel approach design.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">Dave Shea</a>: &#8220;We don&#8217;t care about usability.&#8221; He sees CSS as a way for designers to expand the possibilities of their work. (Witness <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">Zen Garden</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://stopdesign.com/">Doug Bowman</a>: &#8220;CSS is beautiful.&#8221; Not just what the user sees but the structure and underlying code, and the craft that brings it all together. (Review <a href="http://stopdesign.com/present/sxsw2004/hifi/">slides</a>.)</p>
<p>Jeffrey Zeldman wasn&#8217;t there, but he might as well have been. There is a great trick that modern web developers are playing. When justifying their work, they replace any mention of &#8220;CSS&#8221; with &#8220;Web Standards.&#8221; But wait &#8212; wasn&#8217;t HTML 3.2 and table-based layout a &#8220;web standard&#8221;? :-) Of course what they really mean is <em>modern</em> web standards, but this accidentally shorthand aids their cause tremendously, I think. And when I say their cause, I really mean our cause. (Resist <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/tohell/">bad browsers</a>.)</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>One of the things I like about SXSW is that it&#8217;s a time to just think about new ideas without necessarily trying to relate them directly to a particular work project. When I take notes, I write down interesting quotes or concepts that the speakers are presenting, but I also intersperse my own opinions. It&#8217;s important to capture ideas at the time they spark, and today there were enough to fill a book. Instead of summarizing the day I will take some of the themes and work through them in later posts this week.</p>
<p>I should at least note that it was great to hear Joe Trippi speak, though. <a href="http://www.irelan.net/becoming/archives/000995.shtml">Ryan posted some photos</a> from that session and the MoveOn.org keynote.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I almost skipped the <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/panels/index.php?action=detail&amp;con=ia&amp;id=10">accessibility panel</a> but I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t. As usual <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/">Jeffrey Veen</a> did a great job of putting the current web practices into perspective with stories from the old school of web design. It used to be that every day was a battle with designers who were taking what they learned from the print or traditional multimedia worlds and trying to stamp it on to web design, whether it fit or not. But the new crop of designers look at building for the web as a craft. Veen says it&#8217;s about &#8220;designing for the web natively.&#8221; Exactly. He sees it now as a business case &#8212; that good design just tends to lead to degradable and accessible sites.</p>
<p>Ironically, just a year ago Veen shared the stage at SXSW with <a href="http://klynch.com/">Kevin Lynch</a> of Macromedia. Kevin was talking about rich Flash-based applications that often see the web as more of a networking infrastructure than a platform in its own right. Now we see other pieces of Macromedia&#8217;s strategy: their Central product by-passes the web browser entirely. Granted, they are doing some very interesting stuff, but it&#8217;s not entirely relevant to designing for the web. The new reality of web development that Veen spoke about is that designers are embracing what the web is about rather than fighting against it or trying to control it.</p>
<p>The next panel continued the accessibility discussion. James Craig brought up Veen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000266.php">&#8220;Business Value of Web Standards&#8221;</a> essay, and Jim Allan mentioned the needs of Palm devices as another business case to help sell accessibility standards.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s usability. Why is it that many standards-based and accessible web sites are more usable than others? I think there are two reasons.</p>
<p>First, adhering to standards is not just conforming to the specification but also following the recommendation of those standards. For example, use the alt attribute on images to specify a text version. But as Jim Allan said in the session, &#8220;you can&#8217;t just blindly follow the guidelines.&#8221; The second part is the education of this new class of web people. What tools do they use? BBEdit and HomeSite. They are hand-coding this stuff which means they&#8217;ve built dozens or hundreds of web sites. You have to build up a level of experience with what works and what doesn&#8217;t to make progress on usability, and you have to be a veteran web user to know the existing best practices.</p>
<p>After dinner we went to the Frog party, where I met up with Mason Hale and even ran into Carl de Cordova, who was a co-founder of WebEdge, the Mac web developers conference I was a part of years ago. I have a bunch of old photos and archives of the old WebEdge site that I should post one of these days (the domain was unfortunately taken over by a car company). Also met <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm</a>, chatted with Eli Pariser of MoveOn.org, and received the Jakob Nielsen playing card (collect all 8) from the <a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com/">OK/Cancel</a> folks. A good day.</p>

			<p>SXSW Interactive officially begins tomorrow. I met with <a href="http://www.irelan.net/becoming/">Ryan</a> and <a href="http://www.damon.to/">Damon</a> this afternoon to discuss the design for a project at work, eat lots of food, and finish round 2 of my effort to convince Ryan that fixed-width layouts are usually a bad thing. Light rain fell as we made the short walk over to the convention center with <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/">Sam Ruby</a>, who has a <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/panels/index.php?action=detail&amp;con=ia&amp;id=35">session on Wikis</a> this Sunday. Lane Becker is also on the panel, so it should be an interesting one. (At least I think they are on the panel. The PDF schedules don&#8217;t list either one of them.)</p>
<p>Other sessions that look good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Democracy in Action: <i>MoveOn.org</i></li>
<li>Joe Trippi presentation</li>
<li>Weblogs and Emergent Democracy</li>
<li>Replacing Billboard, Bestseller Lists and Editors with Robots: <i>Paul Bausch, Cameron Marlow, Erik Benson (Amazon)</i></li>
<li>Hi-Fi Design with CSS: <i>Doug Bowman, Dan Cederholm, Dave Shea, Chris Schmitt</i></li>
<li>The Frontiers of User Experience: <i>Jeffrey Veen</i></li>
<li>Ridiculously Easy Group Forming: <i>Adam Weinroth (Easyjournal), Tantek, David Sifry, Pete Kaminski, Sam Ruby</i></li>
<li>The Three Little Things: <i>Jason Fried</i></ul>

			<p>I started reading the electronic version of <a href="http://www.craphound.com/est/">Eastern Standard Tribe</a>. Hoping to get through some of it by SXSW and pick up a hard-copy there. I&#8217;ve also been reviewing my Cocoa books, since I&#8217;ve been porting the user interface of an application to Cocoa (still lots of Carbon and cross-platform C++ underneath). More on all that some other time.</p>
<p>For now, here are two somewhat contrasting quotes from the authors of those books, on file format standards:</p>
<p><a href="http://x180.net/2004/01/17.html#banksandpdf">James Duncan Davidson</a>: &#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure that I&#8217;ll always be able to open a PDF file.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2004_01_01_archive.html#107311966175124389">Cory Doctorow</a>: &#8220;ASCII is the new PDF!&#8221;</p>
