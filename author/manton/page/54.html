			<p>Okay, not really. But this has been a crazy and surprising week for my &#8220;little&#8221; application, Wii Transfer. Putting 8 hours each day into &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ (I have a post coming about that tomorrow, by the way) and then juggling home responsibilities, putting out various other fires, and sitting down to work on Wii Transfer until 3am is just not healthy.</p>
<p>Luckily I slept great last night and took a 3-hour nap today. So time to blog again. :-)</p>
<p>Over a week ago I released Wii Transfer 2.0 and made a big mistake, and since I&#8217;ve been programming for the Mac for over a dozen years now, I really should know better. It was buggy. And not just a few minor cosmetic problems, but at least two serious crashers. I simply had not tested enough. It&#8217;s difficult (sometimes impossible) to regain a user&#8217;s trust after their first experience with an application is a bad one, so I got to work that weekend fixing problems and releasing beta builds to customers to get a few extra eyes on the software.</p>
<p>Then Monday came, and <em>all hell broke loose</em>.</p>
<p>Links from &#8220;Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/january#mon-22-wii_transfer, &#8220;Ranchero&#8221;:http://www.ranchero.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=1523, and &#8220;The Unofficial Apple Weblog&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/01/22/wii-transfer-2-0/ were followed by &#8220;Jostiq&#8221;:http://joystiq.com/2007/01/25/wii-transfer-for-mac-os-turns-your-wii-into-a-media-center-but/, &#8220;Infendo&#8221;:http://infendo.com/2007/01/wii-media-center-software.html, &#8220;4 Color Rebellion&#8221;:http://4colorrebellion.com/archives/2007/01/22/wii-transfer-for-mac-reaches-20/, and a bunch of others. Ironically one of the only gaming sites I read that never linked to Wii Transfer was the only one I had actually sent an announcement to (&#8220;GoNintendo&#8221;:http://www.gonintendo.com/). Traffic and sales were way up (&#8220;here&#8217;s a Mint screenshot&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/riverfold_mint.png from one day last week).</p>
<p>But meanwhile, the application was just not that stable. I started rewriting most of the web server inside Wii Transfer and fixing lots of issues with iTunes and iPhoto libraries stored on external drives. Then I made my second mistake: I added a feature (album cover artwork!). Obviously, adding a feature in the middle of bug fixes just delays the original fixes and introduces new problems.</p>
<p>I also quickly realized how many things could go wrong with how music and picture sharing works. It relies on the Nintendo Wii and your Mac being on the same local network. Because Wii Transfer pings a bookmark server to register your IP address, you also have to make sure the app picks the right IP if your Mac is on both ethernet and wireless networks. Worse, many people have the Mac OS X built-in firewall enabled, so users are required to manually open up port 9000.</p>
<p>At one point on Tuesday when sales were coming in, every time I received a PayPal notification email I literally groaned. &#8220;Stop buying this software until I can make it work reliably,&#8221; I would say to the computer. The thing that got me through was that all customers who sent in support email were extremely helpful and patient. The other good news is that with version 2.1.1, it&#8217;s looking pretty solid, and the next update should wrap up any remaining fringe issues.</p>
<p>To everyone who gave Wii Transfer a try, thanks! I think you&#8217;ll like what comes next.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I finished &#8220;Wii Transfer 2.0&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ late Thursday night. This version is an interesting milestone for the application because it goes beyond just using the SD card to shuttle data back and forth between your Mac and Wii. There is a small Cocoa web server embedded inside Wii Transfer that can serve up MP3s and JPEGs directly to the Wii using the Internet Channel. I think this could be the basis for some really fun stuff in the future.</p>
<p>One of the things I added at the last minute is to try to simplify how you connect to your Mac from the Wii. IP addresses are difficult to memorize for most people and may change depending on how your home network is setup. To solve this, Wii Transfer will optionally create a permanent URL for you on bookmark.riverfold.com. You can then add that URL as a favorite for your Wii and it will always redirect to your local machine. Wii Transfer will ping the Riverfold server on startup and update the bookmark database with your current IP address. You can think of it as a simplified version of &#8220;Dynamic DNS&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS.</p>
<p>I just noticed that Wii Transfer is the featured download and staff pick in the &#8220;video section of Apple&#8217;s download site&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/video/. That is a nice surprise. It will be interesting to see what that does to download stats.</p>
<p>One last thing. Starting next month the price will go up to $14 for version 2.0 (free upgrade for all existing users). I usually work on Wii Transfer at night, so the increase will help offset all the sleep I lost. :-) Even at $14 it may be underpriced. Remember the &#8220;Brent Simmons rule&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/168/the-price-is-wrong: anything less than $20 won&#8217;t be taken seriously. In this case though I think it&#8217;s just about right. I&#8217;m also finding a large percentage of purchases from Europe, despite no localization, probably because the US dollar is so weak now. Enjoy!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Last week I said&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/macworld_2007_predictions.html I wasn&#8217;t interested in an iPod phone, unless it was something no one had even thought to expect. Well, it is. I am blown away by the iPhone. <i>The thing runs <strike>Mac</strike> OS X.</i></p>
<p>The iPhone is really inspirational in terms of UI design polish. You can tell they put some years into it. I was playing with Tiger&#8217;s NSAnimation the other night (sort of a poor man&#8217;s &#8220;Core Animation&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/coreanimation.html), and it reinforced for me the fact that UI effects are no longer optional pieces of software design. They can both visually supplement the user interaction and just make the application experience more enjoyable. &#8220;Disco&#8221;:http://www.discoapp.com/, for all the criticism as a glorified Disk Recording framework wrapper, is fun to use. Same goes for the just-released &#8220;Snapshot 2.0&#8221;:http://www.stuntsoftware.com/Snapshot/, which has a really thoughtful single-window UI.</p>
<p>This is going to be another great year to be a Mac developer. And we haven&#8217;t even seen the rest of Leopard yet. Only bump in the road will be if iPhone is a closed platform. The &#8220;comments over at Theocacao&#8221;:http://theocacao.com/document.page/404 provide some interesting commentary on that question.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>A few years ago I used &#8220;VoodooPad Lite&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/ extensively. Every note, to-do list, and feature description went into it. At some point I migrated away from VoodooPad to a combination of text files and &#8220;Ta-da list&#8221;:http://www.tadalist.com/, perhaps fearing I would have too much data in a weird format that would be difficult to get at later.</p>
<p>But I was always on the lookout for a problem that would best be solved with VoodooPad again. With our localized help files for &#8220;Bookshelf 4.1&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/, I tried for most of a day to use VoodooPad to manage the help. I even experimented with Gus&#8217;s dead &#8220;project for remote wiki editing&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi?space=3ec82d22-c72a-01d9-1639-c0cbe4c4c32b, thinking I would write my own web-based help-specific wiki system and plug &#8220;Boomerang&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi/348c223e-0512-01da-1c41-c0cbe4c4fc75 into it. In the end it was too difficult to force the existing static help files into VoodooPad.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to a few nights ago. &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ 1.5 has no Apple Help at all, and it needs some. A perfect opportunity for VoodooPad, and I&#8217;m happy to report that the solution works beautifully. I knew I could make it work because clearly VoodooPad&#8217;s own help files are managed with VoodooPad. After a bit of experimentation I bought a new VoodooPad license and all was well in the world.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>I manage the help content in VoodooPad, creating pages for different help sections and generally just typing away and getting stuff done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HTML export template lives inside the VoodooPad document itself, so everything is in one place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also inside the VoodooPad document is a post-processing script (written in Ruby) that looks for a comment in index.html and inserts the appropriate AppleTitle and AppleIcon meta tags that Apple Help needs to get its work done.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The only part I haven&#8217;t finished yet is that the script should also send the files off to Help Indexer to update the search index. I coded that part but it doesn&#8217;t work yet &#8212; there is something different about how VoodooPad executes these scripts that prevents other applications from launching. (Maybe. I&#8217;ll sort it out eventually.)</p>
<p>You can &#8220;watch a screencast of the process here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/screencasts/2007/voodoopad.mov. I add a new page, enter some filler text, export the VoodooPad document, then re-run the Xcode project and view the changes in Apple Help. Fun!</p>

			<p>Watching from the sidelines as Dan Benjamin prepared his first podcast really made me want to get out &#8220;the microphone&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/194992192/ again. Creating a podcast is a great experience, and I always tell myself I&#8217;ll do them more frequently. There have been a few recent events that I&#8217;ve wanted to capture as podcast episodes, including the experience waiting in line for the Wii, but it just hasn&#8217;t come together.</p>
<p>Enough about me. Go listen to &#8220;The Hivelogic Podcast with Dan Benjamin&#8221;:http://www.hivelogic.com/articles/2007/01/06/podcast_is_here, interviewing &#8220;John Gruber&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/ about the upcoming Macworld announcements. The Macworld keynote is this coming Tuesday at 9am Pacific, but I haven&#8217;t heard word yet on whether it will be streamed live or a delayed rebroadcast.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Dan covers his Macworld predictions&#8221;:http://hivelogic.com/articles/2007/01/04/macworld_2007 in great detail. Instead of predictions, since mine will probably be wrong, I&#8217;m going to list what I <em>want</em> to see:</p>
<p><em>Tablet.</em> I tend to agree with &#8220;Steven Frank&#8217;s analysis&#8221;:http://stevenf.com/2007/01/wherein_i_predict_the_future.php more than &#8220;this former Apple exec&#8221;:http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1981815,00.html, but either way it remains pretty unlikely that a tablet is going to happen under Steve Job&#8217;s watch. At WWDC once Steve Jobs called the Newton a &#8220;little scribbly thing&#8221; or something similar, and it wasn&#8217;t long before he officially gave that division the axe.</p>
<p><em>Numbers.</em> Some people still insist on sending me Excel documents. We need a simple application in the iWork suite that can natively read/write Excel documents and handle the basics.</p>
<p><em>Finder.</em> I&#8217;m pretty sure Leopard will sport a new Finder, as well as user interface candy paint applied across the operating system. The only question is whether they&#8217;ve rewritten it from scratch and in the process introduced even more problems. I&#8217;m optimistic on this one, though, and expect an elegant UI evolution from the Finder team.</p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t care about:</p>
<p><em>iTV.</em> See &#8220;previous post about DRM&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/goodbye_itms.html. If I want to watch a movie, I&#8217;ll put in a DVD. However, I do hope to draw some inspiration from whatever they do and apply it to &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ development.</p>
<p><em>iPod Phone.</em> I have no doubt it will be well designed, but it will also be at least $299 (guess). I have only owned a couple mobile phones in my life, and they were free or nearly free. The iPod Phone will have to be something no one&#8217;s even thought of yet for me to consider it. It&#8217;s kind of like &#8220;Nike + iPod&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/, a luxury that I don&#8217;t really need.</p>
<p>Anyway, should be a fun Macworld. I haven&#8217;t been in years and I&#8217;m a little jealous of those who are attending this year. (But not jealous enough to want to get on a plane next week.) Part of me misses the old days, having a booth and talking with users or seeing what was new on the show floor. I was at the first Macworld keynote after Steve Jobs came back to Apple, while Gil Amelio was still in charge, and I&#8217;ll always remember it as something pretty special.</p>

			<p>When I started on the &#8220;music sharing feature&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/holiday_hacking.html in the upcoming 2.0 release of Wii Transfer, I knew it couldn&#8217;t support protected songs from the iTunes Music Store. Still, it was disappointing when I started using it and such a big chunk of my favorite music was inaccessible. The only DRM problem I&#8217;ve ever run into before now is forgetting to deactivate old machines and hitting the 5-machine limit, but that&#8217;s easily solved, and I have been quick to defend iTMS and promote its convenience to others.</p>
<p>No longer. Overnight my music library has become much less valuable, just because I chose to use it in a different way. Almost all the music I&#8217;ve bought in the last couple of years is from iTunes. I created two smart playlists, one to show protected and one not. Apparently of the 5000 songs on this computer, 500 of them are from iTunes. <em>10%.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what is going to replace my use of iTunes yet, but for now I think I&#8217;ll lean on Amazon Prime&#8217;s free 2-day shipping and just order and rip CDs to good old fashioned high-bitrate MP3s. Too bad, because I do love the iTunes experience. Just gotta keep repeating to myself: text files, JPEGs, and MP3s are forever. Everything else is suspect.</p>

			<p>I got sick (the flu?) shortly after Christmas, but nevertheless managed to sneak in some coding on Wii Transfer 2.0, which I hope to release this weekend. The big new feature for 2.0 is music and picture sharing. Essentially, there is a web server built into Wii Transfer. You can use the Wii&#8217;s Opera web browser to connect directly to your Mac running Wii Transfer and pull up MP3s or iPhoto albums. I&#8217;ve licensed &#8220;Jeroen Wijering&#8217;s Flash-based tools&#8221;:http://www.jeroenwijering.com/ for listening to MP3s and browsing photos. The interface isn&#8217;t perfect yet (the buttons should be bigger for easy TV viewing), but I think it&#8217;s pretty good for a first shot at this. The web server portion is based off of &#8220;J&#252;rgen Schweizer&#8217;s Cocoa example code&#8221;:http://culturedcode.com/cocoa/.</p>
<p>&#8220;Check out this screencast&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/screencasts/sharing.mov to see what most of it looks like. The first part shows the new Wii Transfer main window UI with a source list for switching features, and the second part shows what it looks like from the actual Wii. I just setup a tripod and filmed off the new HDTV with my digital camera.</p>
<p>I also started back on &#8220;real work&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ today. We have some neat stuff shipping later this month that I&#8217;ll be blogging about more once it&#8217;s ready to show. I knew I could easily get lost in inconsequential stuff on the Tuesday after a long break, so I spent a bit of time yesterday reviewing to-do lists and getting my head on straight. Got some real coding and design done today, so no complaints there either.</p>
<p>All in all, 2007 is starting off great. (Except that I still seem to be sick, but I&#8217;m going to try to ignore that for a bit longer.)</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ is now listed as part of the &#8220;MacSanta promotion&#8221;:http://www.macsanta.com/. Only $7 through Christmas day!</p>
<p>I also released Wii Transfer 1.5 late last night. The major change in this version is support for automatically backing up saved game data files from an SD card. The Nintendo Wii by default does not save games to SD cards, but it&#8217;s easy in the Wii settings interface to copy your saved games to an SD card or restore later. If Wii Transfer is running when you insert an SD card into your Mac, it will automatically copy the saved games to your hard drive (in Application Support), organizing them by date. Then there&#8217;s a simple UI for restoring the games back to an SD card. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a short screencast&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/screencast_backup.mov if you are curious what it looks like.</p>
<p>One neat part of this that I was able to do &#8212; and this is consistent with the whole point of Wii Transfer, improving the experience of transferring Wii data &#8212; is to show the real game names in the restore list. The data files actually use a 4-character code, but &#8220;WiiSave.com&#8221;:http://www.wiisave.com/ is maintaining a list of codes to real names. I&#8217;ve baked a portion of that list into Wii Transfer 1.5, and the application also automatically downloads an updated list from the Riverfold web site so that as new games are released, Wii Transfer will know about them.</p>
<p>Now head over to &#8220;MacSanta&#8221;:http://www.macsanta.com/ and pick up some great Mac applications, all 20% off.</p>

			<p>I guess it&#8217;s a sign I&#8217;m not blogging very often when I don&#8217;t even announce my own product! A big thanks to &#8220;Dan Benjamin&#8221;:http://hivelogic.com/ and &#8220;John Gruber&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/ for linking up &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/, a little application I quietly rolled out last night. (I&#8217;d thank the other links too but I&#8217;m still sorting through referrers for today. Maybe it&#8217;s time to buy &#8220;Mint&#8221;:http://www.haveamint.com/.)</p>
<p>Wii Transfer started as a weekend hack to make the process of converting QuickTime movies to more Wii-friendly codecs much smoother. Not many hours into it I realized there are a bunch of useful features I could build around the Wii. Rather than work on it for a few months leading up to a big 1.0 release (all the while not knowing if it would be well-received), I borrowed a little &#8220;less software&#8221;:http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Build_Less.php and brought it to the point that it was generally useful and worth paying for.</p>
<p>This kind of quick iteration is great because it means tonight I can announce version 1.2. There are a handful of minor improvements, but the two big new features are AppleScript support and an interface for quickly opening video podcasts from iTunes.</p>
<p>Overall this has been a really fun process and I&#8217;m interested to see where it goes from here. I will write more about Riverfold, the company, in a later blog post.</p>

			<p>If you&#8217;ve talked to me recently about video games or read &#8220;my post about trying for a Wii pre-order&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2006/10/wii_preorders.html, you know I have become obsessed with getting a Nintendo Wii at launch. The &#8220;high scores that the new Zelda was receiving&#8221;:www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/wii/legendofzeldatwilightprincess last week pretty much sealed the deal for me: <em>I had to have one</em>.</p>
<p>Thursday and Friday if I was out doing errands and passed a store I would inquire about their launch plans. It wasn&#8217;t looking good, with mixed messages from employees about how many units they would be receiving. Saturday afternoon I stopped by Wal-mart at around 2pm and already there were 22 people in line for the midnight launch of only 29 systems for that store. They urged me to stay, but I couldn&#8217;t. I had a whole day planned already, and it didn&#8217;t include video games.</p>
<p>Saturday evening I made a list of a half dozen possible stores and called each one. It was clear right away that if I wanted a Wii on the launch weekend, there was only one choice.</p>
<p><center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/304262928/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/103/304262928_343fac2a3d_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Wii line at Target" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /></a> &nbsp; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/304262930/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/122/304262930_318e0a2597_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Wii sunrise" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /></a> &nbsp; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/304257199/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/113/304257199_761be31e60_s.jpg" width="75" height="75" alt="Wii ticket" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /></a></center></p>
<p>I arrived at Target at about 9:30pm Saturday evening with a chair, blanket, Nintendo DS, and book. They would open ten and a half hours later at 8am the next day, but tickets would be passed at around 7am. Early line campers who had arrived at 3pm in the afternoon had a sign-in list to ensure there was no confusion. I was number 33 out of 60 confirmed Wii systems. By midnight, all the consoles were accounted for, and everyone who arrived afterwards was turned away.</p>
<p>I had a great time talking with other line waiters. It was an interesting mix of people, from John next to me who worked at Apple here in Austin, to a set of young gamers who pulled up with a truck and unloaded two couches, a rug, and a coffee table.</p>
<p>Around 4 in the morning I realized how unprepared I was. It was in the 40s that night and my blanket was completely insufficient. If I ever do something crazy like this again, I&#8217;m packing several blankets, a sleeping bag, and pillows. By 6am I considered the few hours of uncomfortable sleep I got a success and took a jog around the parking lot to get my blood flowing and stop from shivering.</p>
<p>The sun rose and tickets were passed out. The excitement of the night before was back as a Target manager confirmed that they would indeed have a full 60 copies of Zelda, and almost as many for other games. Not everyone is going to get a Wii the first week, but from where I&#8217;m standing Nintendo has done a great job of shipping out as many systems as possible and making sure the games and controllers are there to go along with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post again next week about my impressions on Wii Sports and Zelda, but so far I am not disappointed. I make no apologies for being a Nintendo fan, but the Wii is neither over-hyped nor a gimmick, and I think the system will live up to its original codename.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

			<p>Last year I participated in NaNoWriMo and successfully &#8220;completed a 50,000 word novel&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2005/12/50136_words.html in one month. It was a great experience, but when someone conducted an informal survey on 43things of who would be doing it again this year, I answered that it was just something I wanted to do once in my life, like running a marathon, and I wouldn&#8217;t be doing it again.</p>
<p>And yet, before November rolled around again, the idea for a novel started growing in my mind. I had pretty much decided to go for it again. On the 1st of the month I wrote the opening and started organizing notes for the characters and plot.</p>
<p>But that same night I was sketching with friends at a coffee shop instead of writing. &#8220;Paul Adam&#8221;:http://www.untameduniverse.net/ and I talked about 24-Hour Comic Day, NaNoWriMo, and side projects. That conversation made me realize that I have a <em>bunch</em> of stuff I want to work on right now, and writing a novel which I have no immediate plan to publish just can&#8217;t fit into my schedule right now. NaNoWriMo is an all-consuming thing &#8212; you have to drop everything to finish it.</p>
<p>The story and characters I came up with have some potential, though. Instead of cramming it into a month, I may work on it a bit over the next year or two.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I started writing this post yesterday afternoon. Worried that I would jinx a victory, I wrote two versions: one for a narrow loss and one for what really happened.</p>
<p>Two years ago, after Kerry lost, &#8220;I wrote&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2004/11/after_almost_winning.html: &#8220;We almost won, and all the hard work of the last 18 months will pay off big in two short years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s two years later, and we did it. DNC chairman Howard Dean&#8217;s &#8220;50-state strategy&#8221;:http://democrats.org/a/party/a_50_state_strategy/ worked. The media will tell you that the election was just about Iraq and Bush, but it goes deeper than that &#8212; voters are sick of Republican corruption, tired of half-hearted attempts at health care, and longing for a real vision for public education. You can see the patterns by looking at the progressive wins in state races and on local propositions too.</p>
<p>There are &#8220;20 posts in the politics category&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/category/politics.html of my blog, and they include some of my favorites from the last 4 years. It&#8217;s nice to be on the winning side again after too long. The next part of the job is for Democrats to show everyone in America that real progress can be made in Washington. Deliver. Then keep organizing and make it all happen again in 2008.</p>

<p><center><img src="../../../images/2006/voting.jpg" alt="Voting" width="400" height="195" border="0" style="border: 1px solid gray" /></center></p>
<p>Yesterday Traci and I called voters as part of &#8220;MoveOn.org&#8217;s Call for Change&#8221;:http://www.moveon.org/. I&#8217;m always nervous about calling complete strangers. I did this for the first time for Howard Dean&#8217;s campaign and it&#8217;s easy to get disillusioned with answering machines and hang-ups. But almost everyone we talked to was planning to vote today, and I think there&#8217;s definitely a sense that <em>this election matters</em>. Sometimes a simple reminder is the difference between voting or skipping it, so if you only reach a handful of people it can make the difference in a close race if thousands of other people are doing the same.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be up late tonight watching the returns. Polls close early in some places and may get crowded, so don&#8217;t wait any longer if you haven&#8217;t voted yet. For location info call 1-866-MY-VOTE-1.</p>

I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to see each of his films in the theater, and this is definitely his best yet. It has actually been finished for a while. &#8220;I posted about it back in 2002&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2002/09/bill_plympton_has.html when he started production. Before the showing I asked him about making an appearance at &#8220;STAPLE! this coming March&#8221;:http://www.staple-austin.org/ but it doesn&#8217;t look like his schedule will allow it. He&#8217;s one of about 4 animators I hoped to approach about showing their films at STAPLE!, in addition to some great local talent we&#8217;ll have speaking and showing their work.</p>

			<p>I saw The Illusionist when it came out a couple months ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. &#8220;I love magic&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2005/02/the_great_scott.html. The film was well told, the ending a surprise for me. Edward Norton was really good in it too. I re-watched Fight Club a week later, for the first time since the theatrical release.</p>
<p>Last night, I saw &#8220;The Prestige&#8221;:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/. How lucky are we to have two movies about magicians in the same year? The Illusionist was really good, but The Prestige sidesteps direct comparison and just creates a new league for itself. My head was still buzzing an hour after the film was over, unraveling the different layers of the film, what it all meant for the characters and their actions. It was one of those rare works that inspires, both from the flawless filmmaking and the dedication of the fictional characters as well. I was literally on the edge of my seat and completely captivated.</p>
<p>Even as the credits started to roll I wanted to see it again. It&#8217;s that good.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Two weeks ago I casually showed up to EB Games 5 minutes before they opened, hoping to luck out with a &#8220;Nintendo Wii&#8221;:http://us.wii.com/ pre-order. Unfortunately the last slot was taken by someone who was there over two hours earlier, and at least a couple dozen people (including me) were turned away before the store even opened.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m determined to get one of these consoles, and there&#8217;s something interesting about trying to get one at launch. Every day new reviews flow in to gaming blogs. I don&#8217;t see myself as a hardcore gamer, but the Wii looks like an innovative system with several fun games available at launch or shortly after.</p>
<p>So I called Toys R Us last night to inquire about pre-orders opening up today at 10am. He said they had 10 Wii and only 3 PS3s. Furthermore, mall security wouldn&#8217;t let anyone on the property until 4am. This would seem to limit the opportunity for all-night campers, so I was pretty hopeful as I left for the store shortly after 4am this morning.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that right. I have become so obsessed with this that I was willing to spend 6 hours in line. Luckily, the weather is beautiful this weekend. I packed a book, iPod, and sketchpad into my bag and left feeling pretty good, that at the least I would have some time alone to read or write or listen to music.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2006/wii_line.jpg" width="200" height="150" hspace="10" vspace="5" alt="Wii line from phone" align="right" /> There were already at least 20 people there when I arrived. Several in line were hoping to reserve both Wii and PS3. One made the comment that they would be selling the PS3 on Ebay, but keep the Wii for themselves. There was even someone waiting for the new Elmo doll, which made the whole scene even more bizarre.</p>
<p>Apparently some of the folks had been there well before 4am, probably closer to midnight or earlier. The details are sketchy, but the story I heard involves a bewildered security officer, two police cars, threat of jail time, and a mad dash at 4am to the front door. By the time I got there, the last Wii pre-order slots were being decided by a foot race across the parking lot. Seriously. Meanwhile, a second line at the exit door was setup in a futile effort by those too stubborn to admit defeat.</p>
<p>I finished the banana I had brought for breakfast, played a little multiplayer Nintendo DS, and left before 5am with a &#8220;good luck&#8221; and a wave to those crazy enough to get there before me. I guess I&#8217;ll try again at Best Buy or Target next month. Rumor points to &#8220;as much as 120 units available&#8221;:http://gonintendo.com/?p=7517 at some stores.</p>

			<p>C4 was last weekend and looked like a lot of fun. Unfortunately I was about travelled-out this year with RailsConf and WWDC. Perhaps next time.</p>
<p>Daniel Jalkut was the first I saw with nice write-up. He provides &#8220;a speed-through of sessions&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/213/c4-abridged and closes with what is probably the biggest draw for attendees:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As inspiring and as much fun as the scheduled speakers were, the unstructured social time both between sessions and in the evenings were just as much fun, and probably just as educational.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I subscribe to a couple dozen Mac developer blogs, and keeping an eye on Flickr and Technorati tags for C4 is another great way to see what developers are up to. Mr. Rentzsch himself has a &#8220;set of links here&#8221;:http://rentzsch.com/c4/zeroLinkage, and Mike Zornek just posted some &#8220;short videos of the room&#8221;:http://clickablebliss.com/blog/2006/10/25/c4_photos_and_movies/ that give another view of the show.</p>
<p>When I go back through my older Mac programming posts, I&#8217;m reminded that I don&#8217;t really blog about Mac development as much as I used to. Perhaps that is because there are so many other good Mac guys blogging now.</p>

			<p>The Da Vinci Code appealed to me and many others because it successfully mixes pieces of both art history and code breaking. The book captures in fiction the same fascination I had first cracking open Applied Cryptography.</p>
<p>A few months ago &#8220;Damon&#8221;:http://www.damonclinkscales.com/ completed a &#8220;companion to the book and film&#8221;:http://www.davincicc.com/, containing images and links to concepts organized by chapter. It uses the VitalBook digital book format, and is viewable in the software I helped write, &#8220;VitalSource Bookshelf&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/. I&#8217;m working on some fun new stuff for Bookshelf at the moment that uses web services and &#8220;SSE&#8221;:http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sse/, something I hope to post more about in the future.</p>
<p>In other Da Vinci news, story artist and animator Jim Capobianco has completed animation on his short film &#8220;Leonardo&#8221;:http://leoanimation.blogspot.com/. I saw a preview of this at &#8220;2d Expo two years ago&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2004/07/california_adventure.html, and I can&#8217;t wait to see the finished product. Even in storyboards and rough pencil animation it was great.</p>

			<p>I picked up the board game &#8220;Carcasonne&#8221;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UNAX?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mantonorg&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00005UNAX/ a few weeks ago and have been enjoying it. It&#8217;s great to see some innovation in board games again, and it&#8217;s a relaxing change of pace from video games. Target and the other big box stores are still mostly packed with remakes of classic board games, which are fine, but if you seek out the more speciality shops there&#8217;s a range of good stuff available. I bought my copy at &#8220;Dragon&#8217;s Lair&#8221;:http://www.dlair.net/, a local Austin comics and games shop that I&#8217;ve been frequenting for about 15 years, but I&#8217;ve seen it featured prominently at other quality toy stores.</p>
<p>I originally sought out Carcasonne for play between adults, but I&#8217;ve found the game also works great for kids even younger than the 8 years recommended on the box. Just follow a few rule simplifications. First, no farmers. Next, as recommended by someone in an Amazon review, use the word &#8220;traveler&#8221; instead of thief. And finally, just score a single point for any completed castle, road, or cloister. Part of the charm of the game is in constructing the map anyway, so these simplified rules make for fast and enjoyable games for younger children.</p>
