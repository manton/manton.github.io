				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The sort of odd &#8220;best of both worlds&#8221; balance in my different projects at &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ and as a solo shop is that I love working with a team, and I also love working alone. I mean really alone, doing the planning and design and coding and marketing. I&#8217;ve resisted farming out any piece of my apps at &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ (except the application icon) so that I can have complete control. It&#8217;s brutally hard sometimes, but it&#8217;s mine.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re working by yourself and add another person to the project, a funny thing happens: you become a manager. Before, you could spend 100% of your time on the work. Now you can allocate 50-75%, because you&#8217;re getting the new programmer up to speed, answering questions, and setting priorities. If you&#8217;re lucky (and I usually am), the person you added is contributing so much that it easily makes up for your loss in productivity, and then some.</p>
<p>The trade-off is worth it. Exchange the previous low communication overhead for extra coding man-hours.</p>
<p>You can build something great with a team, something that would be impossible alone, if you surround yourself with people who are better at your job than you are. I love that first moment when a team doubles in size from 1 to 2, or 2 to 4.</p>
<p>But after the initial frenzy of coding and emails and new features, I usually get burned out again. The project doesn&#8217;t strictly need me anymore, and I&#8217;m ready to get back to starting an app from scratch, when the scope is so small that the whole thing still fits in my head.</p>

			<p>I like this paragraph from a &#8220;long post by Mike Lee&#8221;:http://le.mu.rs/motherfucker/Entries/2010/7/1_Fuck_modesty.html</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;On any project, whether it&#8217;s a band performance or a team shipping, there&#8217;s a time to curse, and a time to praise. Someone who gets those in the right order is an inspiring leader. Someone who gets them backwards is just an asshole.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned on a recent &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2010/06/episode-31-skipping-the-morning-session/ episode, I have a really hard time remembering who I meet unless I read their blog, or follow them on Twitter, or have heard about their reputation. None of these were true when I first met Mike Lee, walking to pizza one night at C4&#91;1&#93;. I didn&#8217;t even know at the time that he worked at Delicious Monster. But it didn&#8217;t matter because he essentially opened with: &#8220;I was hit by a car last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bam! World&#8217;s toughest programmer indeed, and now I&#8217;ll never forget his face or the conversation. We can&#8217;t all be as relentlessly passionate and memorable as Mike, but there is a lesson here in personal brand: finding what sets us apart from every other programmer and letting that shape our voice and the projects we work on.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mike Rohde racked up $190 in iTunes in-app purchases&#8221;:http://www.rohdesign.com/weblog/archives/003193.html without knowing it, blaming an app called &#8220;Fishies&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fishies-by-playmesh/id360868737?mt=8 by PlayMesh for tricking his son into purchasing virtual items without a password prompt. He was obviously pretty upset &mdash; I would be too! &mdash; but calling it a &#8220;scam&#8221; probably goes too far. So what really happened?</p>
<p>It is fairly well known that after the App Store prompts for your iTunes password, you can download more apps for a certain length of time (at least a few minutes) before it requires a password again. What seemed less clear is that this applies to in-app purchases as well.</p>
<p>To be sure, I ran a test to confirm the behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download a new free app from the App Store (I downloaded the current number 1 iPhone app, Farm Story Summer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter your password to confirm the download.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as it finishes, go to another completely different app (in my case it was Iconfactory&#8217;s Ramp Champ, which I had downloaded months ago).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchase an in-app virtual item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It prompts for whether you want to buy the item (the standard Apple prompt), but <em>without requiring a password</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What must have happened to Mike is that he bought something, entered his password, and then handed the iPad over to his son. His son played the fish game and clicked a bunch of random stuff (likely got the Buy prompt), but because the whole concept of virtual currency is kind of confusing, and because it didn&#8217;t ask for a password, the app happily let him make all the purchases.</p>
<p>I doubt the developer of this app did anything wrong. A reasonable argument could be made that iTunes should either not cache passwords at all, or keep a separate cache for app downloads vs. in-app purchases, or maybe always prompt for a password on in-app purchases. My kids and other kids I know have also used this backdoor trick to sneak a couple app downloads, but usually it&#8217;s a few bucks, not $190. Consumable virtual items (that you can keep buying over and over) make this problem much worse.</p>
<p>On &#8220;episode 60 of This Week In Startups&#8221;:http://thisweekin.com/thisweekin-startups/this-week-in-startups-60-with-neil-young/, Jason Calacanis interviewed ngmoco founder Neil Young about the mobile game business, focusing on the hit iPhone/iPad game &#8220;We Rule&#8221;:http://werule.ngmoco.com/. I was stunned to learn from the show that some individuals spend not only hundreds of dollars but up to $10,000 on in-app purchases in We Rule. Neil Young was happy to take their money, but something feels wrong here, like a gambling addiction gotten way out of hand. Or maybe just kids running up their dad&#8217;s credit card bill.</p>

			<p>Alright, it&#8217;s been 2 weeks. How does the iPhone 4 hold up?</p>
<p>For me, there was less urgency to this launch then for previous iPhone releases. I wanted the 3GS on day one (video recording!) and of course I waited all afternoon for the original iPhone (shiny!). Likewise I couldn&#8217;t wait for the iPad. This time I viewed iMovie and FaceTime as the killer apps. Sign me up!</p>
<p>But I wasn&#8217;t willing to wait all day. I tried the same approach that had worked great for the iPad: show up late in the day after the madness has settled down. No luck this time. I waited about half an hour, then came back before closing and waited a couple more hours to get a voucher for the next day. Total wait time about 3.5 hours over 2 days and 3 visits.</p>
<p>To get it on day 1, most people waited 6 hours. I&#8217;m sure &#8220;John Gruber&#8217;s story on Flickr&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/4731689070/in/contacts/ was common too.</p>
<p>This was Apple&#8217;s most poorly-managed launch I&#8217;ve been to. The 3GS line was pretty fast. For iPad it was extremely quick &mdash; in and out in half an hour. I mostly blame the extra step of requiring activation in-store, but there were enough problems that I think this whole thing was mismanaged somewhere.</p>
<p>Some of the inconsistent messages I heard depending on which Apple Store employee I talked to:</p>
<ul>
<li>AT&amp;T activation is not the bottleneck / yes it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are selling 30 phones every 10 minutes / no idea how long the wait is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&#8217;ll shut down the line at 7pm and give out vouchers / staying open until 2am.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vouchers will allow you to skip everyone else in line the next day / you&#8217;re guaranteed a phone but have to wait in line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also &#8220;collected a few tweets about the launch&#8221;:http://tweetlib.com/manton/iphone4.</p>
<p>Anyway, the phone. It&#8217;s the best phone I&#8217;ve ever seen. No question.</p>
<p>Now that some time has passed, I think I can comment on the reception issue. It&#8217;s real. Outside my house, I don&#8217;t notice it. But my street is a notoriously bad dead zone, and while I don&#8217;t get any more dropped calls than I used to, I can no longer hold the phone in the palm of my left hand when using mobile Safari. It&#8217;s pretty frustrating because I&#8217;ve been holding the phone this way for 3 years. It&#8217;s awkward to break the habit.</p>
<p>Having said that, I&#8217;ll close with the same thing I told strangers who came up asking about the phone. It&#8217;s easy to overlook the reception issue because of how great the rest of the phone is, and all existing iPhone users will love the iPhone 4. Eventually I&#8217;ll just cave in and buy a bumper.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m fascinated with App Store pricing. There&#8217;s just so much interesting stuff going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>99-cent apps and the race to the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users expecting apps to be cheaper because the device is smaller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The high-end successes like OmniGraffle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sales and pricing gimmicks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether apps can compete outside of the top 100.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So when 37signals launched their first iPad app &mdash; Draft, for sketching mockups and quickly uploading them to Campfire &mdash; the first thing I wondered was: &#8220;how much?&#8221; The comments on their &#8220;launch blog post&#8221;:http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2420-launch-draft-for-ipad are a hilarious and sad mix of the usual cheapskates balanced with 37signals defenders. But the most amusing part is that at only $10, Draft is a bargain compared to Campfire itself, which has an entry-level paid plan of nearly $150/year.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m a big Campfire fan, actually. The best iPhone client for Campfire, Ember, has a permanent spot on &#8220;my home screen&#8221;:http://www.firstand20.com/homescreens/manton-reece/.)</p>
<p>My first indie iPad app, a 3-4 week project that has stretched to 3-4 months, will also be $10. At that price it will be twice as expensive as its competition. I&#8217;m pricing it that way for three main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s worth the price of two trips to Starbucks, because it takes the category in a new direction with features no one else is doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s designed for people who are serious about this stuff, not an impulse buy, not for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s a standalone app but includes an optional web complement, offered for free, but which will incur &#8220;real hosting costs&#8221;:http://www.heroku.com/.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Daniel Jalkut and I talked about this a bit on &#8220;Core Intuition 28&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2010/04/episode-28-the-ipad-super-episode/ &mdash; that it might be okay to overcharge a little for 1.0 rather than raise the price later, and that it should be possible to build a business on the iPad the same way many developers have on the Mac: not by looking for the big overnight hit but by steadily selling some number of copies every day and letting it spread by word of mouth.</p>
<p>Marco Arment wrote about this as &#8220;App Store B&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/208454730 in October last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;More of their customers notice and demand great design and polish. More sales come from people who have heard of your product first and seek it out by name. Many of these apps are priced above $0.99. These are unlikely to have giant bursts of sales, and hardly any will come close to matching the revenue of the high-profile success stories, but they have a much greater chance of building sustained, long-term income.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re three months into the iPad, just passed 3 million devices sold, and not every app has dropped to near-free. I think $10 iPad apps in particular are going to remain pretty common.</p>

			<p>I like &#8220;this Flickr set from Brent Simmons&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/brentsimmons/sets/72157623879850432/ showing the stages of building NetNewsWire for the iPad. It&#8217;s exactly the process I&#8217;m going through right now with my new app. Get some placeholder views and tables in there, then iterate, each time filling in more of the missing pieces.</p>
<p>iPad interface design is also proving to be much more difficult than I thought it would be. Concepts that work on the iPhone don&#8217;t necessarily translate to the larger device, and there are very few iPad apps to draw inspiration from. There&#8217;s no standout app from Apple&#8217;s lineup either, at least not in the way that iTunes 1.0 defined nearly every Mac app to follow. With the exception of some very basic ideas like splitviews collapsing in portrait mode, and a generous sprinkling of popovers, I&#8217;ve yet to see much consistency from new touch apps.</p>
<p>Apps that have had the biggest influence on me so far: from the iPhone, Birdfeed and Pastebot; and on the iPad, Mail and Twitterrific. Send me a reply &#8220;on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton if you have any other recommendations.</p>

			<p>My first reaction when I started reading &#8220;The Kids Are All Right&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/kids_are_all_right on Daring Fireball was: Well, I had to disagree with a John Gruber essay eventually, might as well be this one. There was no developer program fee when I started building Mac apps! You could write whatever you wanted and share it with friends.</p>
<p>But then I thought more about the $99 hurdle. What was I doing as a teenager and would the procedures Apple has in place now have stopped me? (For context, I&#8217;m 34.)</p>
<p>I started programming for the Mac with THINK Pascal, a beautiful little development environment. Then I moved to C with Dave Mark&#8217;s book, which came with a C compiler on a floppy inside the back cover. Eventually I saved up and bought Symantec C++. Even at an educational discount these were expensive compared to the free Xcode of today.</p>
<p>At that point I&#8217;m pretty heavily invested in the Mac, but the killer was the documentation. I&#8217;m sure I spent hundreds of dollars on &#8220;Inside Macintosh&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Macintosh books. Our senior year in high school, my friends and I would meet at a restaurant before class for coffee and breakfast. I remember I&#8217;d get there early and sit in the booth with one of my oversized volumes of Inside Mac, taking in too much caffeine for my own good while I devoured every page, even the advanced topics that were still over my head.</p>
<p>I lived and breathed this stuff pretty heavily for a few years. To imagine letting a $99 iPhone dev fee and some locked-down APIs prevent me from building apps is laughable. Great computers inspire people to build new software. That&#8217;s how it was when I got my first Mac, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s that way for the new generation of young iPhone and iPad tinkerers.</p>
<p>One day I hope the App Store will be more open. But it is what it is. I&#8217;ll point out where I think Apple can improve, and then I&#8217;ll build and ship anyway. It makes no sense to sit around and complain on my blog about the good old days while some kid half my age is taking his or her idea all the way to the top of the App Store and owning the platform of the future.</p>

			<p>It appears I was too optimistic &#8220;in my last post&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/03/24hour_review_times.html about the App Store getting better.</p>
<p>The iPhone version of Snowtape, in development for months, &#8220;was rejected&#8221;:http://www.vemedio.com/blog/posts/134 because it could let users record and share audio from the internet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;His sole words were, that there are lots of things missing in the SDK agreement and that they can not foresee any circumstance that leads to a denial of an app. That&#8217;s right! We did not violate any paragraph of the SDK, yet they forbid us distributing our app.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The developer removed the ability to transfer audio files off the phone and then Apple let the app through.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s this post &#8220;on the developer forums&#8221;:https://devforums.apple.com/message/190892 about an iPad app rejection because they recreated a UI innovation from the new Photos app. Apple said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The application uses a tap and a pinch to expand feature that is present in Apple iPad Applications. This action is associated solely with Apple applications, and we kindly ask that you update your app appropriately.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a bunch of iPhone and iPad development this week. The more I work with it, the more I love the platform. But it just takes a couple rejections to sour the whole experience.</p>
<p>And yes, I realize I&#8217;m posting this on one of the most exciting days in the history of the App Store. The first round of iPad apps hitting the store today look fantastic.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Three years ago &#8220;I wrote the following&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/customer.html about customer support:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most people who buy Mac software from independent developers know that it&#8217;s only 1-5 people behind the company. We can&#8217;t compete with the Microsofts and Adobes of the world on application size, but we can compete on quality customer service. _Being small is a competitive advantage_.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems reasonable, but the fact is that many small companies are struggling to keep up with the support load. &#8220;Jesse Grosjean recently downgraded&#8221;:http://blog.hogbaysoftware.com/post/468160055/support-expectations his support expectations for customers. From the official site:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer basic questions and license key/order issues as fast as I can. I also appreciate larger questions and feature suggestions, but I&#8217;m finding that I no longer have time to answer them all as I used to (mostly). I promise to read and consider everything, but you may not get an individual response.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of Jesse&#8217;s TaskPaper and his minimalist approach to Mac development. He is very honest with customers and encourages participation starting with early beta versions.</p>
<p>But it can be damaging to set support expectations too low. Here&#8217;s what a support page says about support in &#8220;Pastebot&#8221;:http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot/, another one of my favorite iPhone apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We try our best to answer every support question. But please make sure your question hasn&#8217;t already been answered in our FAQ. If you email us with an issue that has already been explained in the FAQs, we may skip the email.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This seems slightly backwards to me. The questions in the FAQ are the <em>easiest</em> to answer! I respond to those immediately. It&#8217;s the hard questions for which I don&#8217;t have a good answer yet that usually take the longest time or are more likely to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Is the weight of support for iPhone developers just too much? TaskPaper and Pastebot are both very popular. I guess we can all hope to be successful enough that we find out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I had a question for &#8220;Beanstalk&#8221;:http://beanstalkapp.com/ yesterday and received a response in just 19 minutes and an additional follow-up response in under 10 minutes. I like to show off impressive companies, so I tweeted how fast their response was. &#8220;Their answer&#8221;:http://twitter.com/Beanstalkapp/status/11270045214 to my tweet? &#8220;We&#8217;re usually faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yep, that&#8217;s the right attitude. Set your standards high.</p>

			<p>&#8220;At VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ we now have a dozen Xserves running Ruby on Rails and a couple others running MySQL. While it&#8217;s mostly stable now, over the years there have been several mystery show-stopper problems that no one seems to have on other platforms.</p>
<p>Which is why I found this &#8220;quote from Rentzsch&#8221;:http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/316835872/mac-os-x-server-a-fear-realized so interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The trick is to radically minimize all services performed by Mac OS X Server itself, and instead run services in VMware-hosted Debian images. At that point, Mac OS X Server becomes little more than a simple container for VMware, something it seems able to handle with a minimum of tantrums.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems kind of wasteful, but Mac OS X Server really is overkill most of the time.</p>
<p>Related: over the weekend I checked into &#8220;Heroku&#8221;:http://www.heroku.com/. I&#8217;m impressed with what they have built. If it works as advertised, I think I&#8217;ll supplement my Dreamhost stuff with Heroku any time I need a Ruby backend.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;m of two minds about &#8220;Trade-Off&#8221;:http://bit.ly/beDE2m by Kevin Maney. I picked up the book mostly on the strength of its tagline: <em>Why Some Things Catch On, and Others Don&#8217;t. The Ever-Present Tension Between Quality and Convenience.</em> Pretty good, right?</p>
<p>The premise is great &mdash; that you have to choose when building a business whether to have an expensive, high fidelity product or a less expensive, more accessible product. Trying to do both usually leads to failure. It&#8217;s like when I see an application marketed as &#8220;easy to use, yet powerful!&#8221; That&#8217;s often a red flag that it is neither.</p>
<p>My issue with the book is that, like most business books, it simply drags on too long. What should have taken a couple days to read turned into months of slogging through a few pages at a time. There are some great stories in the 200 pages, but the idea behind the book, which is captured on the cover of the book itself, gets repeated over and over. It&#8217;s almost like Maney copied and pasted some of the key points and scattered them throughout the book as filler.</p>
<p>37signals said that in the final draft of &#8220;Rework&#8221;:http://37signals.com/rework/ they cut the page count nearly in half, and I think some deeper edits in Trade-Off would have helped too. Take the first 20 pages to explain the idea, and then another 80 pages of case study chapters with anecdotes, stories, and interviews. Done.</p>
<p>Complaints about the size and structure of the book aside, though, I got a lot out of Trade-Off. While Maney often strains to fit the book&#8217;s core on top of successful or failed businesses that are too complicated to be applicable (I didn&#8217;t appreciate the Newton-bashing), he makes some great points that helped me put my own app &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ in perspective, and will likely change how I market and build new features for it.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I noticed a couple tweets last month about fast, less than 24-hour review times for iPhone app submissions. After I tweeted it, a whole bunch of other people came forward with similar stories. Apps going from submission to ready-for-sale in 12 to 24 hours.</p>
<p>The App Store is still fundamentally broken in many ways, possibly beyond repair depending on who you talk to, but there&#8217;s no question that fast review times are great for developers. Even if the progress stops with this, it&#8217;s a significant improvement to the App Store process.</p>
<p>Is it just for established devs? Just for minor bug fixes? It&#8217;s not the latter, since some of these were brand new apps. The question is whether this was a change for a certain class of developers and apps or whether it represents an overall speed-up to the review process, and maybe even a hint at prepping for the iPad launch.</p>
<p>Review times are a big deal and they&#8217;ve gone mainstream. Opera Mini has a very public &#8220;count up&#8221;:http://my.opera.com/community/countup/ widget as part of their extensive pre-approval hype. You can tell from the demos that Opera put a huge amount of work into polishing Mini before submitting it, to remove as many potential objections as possible, and to get users excited before it ships. A high-profile rejection now would erase any goodwill that Apple has built up recently.</p>
<p>I know some developers are nervous with openly discussing or blogging about their relationship with Apple, but I think more people should follow Opera&#8217;s lead. By being vocal on the App Store&#8217;s strengths and shortcomings, we force Apple to be more transparent. Bad press has a proven history of leading to overturned rejections. The narrative of the last few months, to me, is that the App Store is getting better, and I don&#8217;t think it would be happening without the critics.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I get a lot of great feedback about &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/. There&#8217;s value in almost every feature request, even the ones I don&#8217;t plan to directly implement. Some people also suggest that I should copy more from iPhoto. While I understand this &mdash; they want a familiar interface &mdash; it has always been my goal to be different than iPhoto. Why?</p>
<p>Two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhoto never quite worked for me, and only by being different can you hope to be better. I took a few things that iPhoto did poorly (like tagging, video playback, and upload) and built the entire interface around them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I just created a clone of iPhoto <em>but for videos</em>, Apple could expand the video support in iPhoto one day and I would be left with nothing. If my app grows in a completely different direction, however, then even if they add video support to iPhoto my app will still appeal to people who aren&#8217;t satisfied with iPhoto&#8217;s approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know I&#8217;m on to something because when I show the app to a certain type of person (who has thousands of short videos, or no quick way to share them) their eyes light up. It&#8217;s now just a matter of pumping out new versions to refine the interface and fill in the missing pieces. I have major features planned for the next few dot release (1.4, 1.5, and 1.6) to try to give customers as much value as I can, and execute on the potential for the application.</p>
<p>Both Aperture 3 and Lightroom 3 now have video support, but I&#8217;m not too worried. There&#8217;s plenty of room between iLife and $199/$299 for Clipstart to carve out a customer base.</p>

			<p>With the iPad set to ship in just a week and a half, I&#8217;ve been quietly reshuffling some of my projects around it. I&#8217;ve written critically of the iPhone and App Store a couple times, such as how the iPhone is a gold rush distraction that &#8220;doesn&#8217;t need me&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/09/its_okay_to_ignore.html. I also stand by &#8220;earlier opinions&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/11/the_only_2.html of how unfixable the App Store is, especially now when it&#8217;s obvious that any effort trying to convince Apple to open the store is completely wasted. They never will.</p>
<p>But I really like what I&#8217;ve seen of the iPad platform so far and I think it represents a big shift for everyday computing in a way that a cell phone can&#8217;t. So I renewed my membership in the iPhone developer program.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on 2 apps for the iPad. The first is just a minor iPad refresh of an existing iPhone app at VitalSource called &#8220;Bookshelf Noteview&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bookshelf-noteview/id333263742?mt=8 (iTunes link). It&#8217;s for reading notes and highlights synced from our e-book platform.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not ready to announce the next app yet, but it&#8217;s a personal project which I had originally written for the Mac over a year ago. I shelved it at the time because I wasn&#8217;t sure there was demand, the backend web services weren&#8217;t mature, and I wasn&#8217;t ready to take it to completion. For the iPad though, it might be perfect.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s ultimately where I see the most interesting potential for the iPad. New middle-ground apps that we haven&#8217;t even thought of yet, not ports from another platform. Apps that would feel small or distracting or wrong on the Mac, yet equally oversized for a relatively underpowered iPhone. Maybe the never-tested-on-a-real-device launch day apps will be buggy and the overall quality low, but I can&#8217;t wait to try them anyway.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>As I &#8220;wrote in January&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/01/macworld_expo_2010.html, I decided to go to Macworld to show off Clipstart and Wii Transfer, and to experience the conference again and hang out with friends. I ended up doing less of the latter, because I lost my voice and was feeling terrible for a couple days, but nevertheless the trip was great and I&#8217;m very glad I went. Worth it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my summary of the show, what it took for me to be there and what I got out of it for &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/. This is supposed to be in the spirit of &#8220;Rogue Amoeba&#8217;s excellent series on Macworld&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2007/01/16/should-i-exhibit-at-macworld-part-1-costs/, but more from a super-tiny company perspective, and just where my experience differs.</p>
<p>I do want to quickly mention costs, since that&#8217;s the primary consideration when planning these things. I took advantage of the Indie Developer Spotlight shared kiosk to keep investment low. In fact, I wouldn&#8217;t have gone otherwise. I kept the whole trip to about $2700, with a rough breakdown like:</p>
<p>$1250 &#8211; space on the show floor</p>
<p>$900 &#8211; hotel for 4 nights</p>
<p>$250 &#8211; flights to and from San Francisco</p>
<p>$100 &#8211; printed &#8220;2000 flyers&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/4326331440/</p>
<p>$200 &#8211; other misc costs, cabs, and food</p>
<p>I could have saved some money in there on the hotel, but in general I think I did pretty well. For a lot indies it&#8217;s probably not that much different than a WWDC trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/4425406126/in/set-72157623476367967/"><img src="../../../images/2010/flyers_ollie.html" alt="flyers_ollie.png" title="flyers_ollie.png" border="0" width="200" height="138" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /></a> I worked 8 hours each day on my feet at Moscone North, in my little booth space in the very corner of the expo. I was lucky for two things: Guy English was awesome and covered for me a couple times so I could take a real break; and the restrooms and water fountain were so close I could slip away when traffic was slow and be back without missing much.</p>
<p>The less expensive booth option was supposed to be for a table shared between 3 developers, with presumably a dozen or more small companies filling the area. But unlike the iPhone pavilion in the center of the tradeshow, which was packed with exhibitors, hardly any Mac developers took advantage of this offer. It was just me and one other company.</p>
<p>This was disappointing at first, since a less dense area doesn&#8217;t convey the same excitement and means less foot traffic. But there were other aspects of the deal that turned out better than expected, such as included wired internet even though none was originally promised. Compared to a traditional booth, it was a bargain.</p>
<p>Before leaving Austin for San Francisco I jotted down a few notes on how I could measure success, since I didn&#8217;t want to pin whether it was worth it just to direct sales.</p>
<p><em>See friends and meet new people.</em> Check, but there were a lot of people that I ran into very briefly and didn&#8217;t get to really talk to. See aforementioned lost voice.</p>
<p><em>Get ideas from customers.</em> Check, got plenty of great ideas. I loved talking to random Mac people, not limited to just the ones who bother to send email.</p>
<p><em>Figure out how to sell the product.</em> There&#8217;s nothing like explaining your application over and over again all day to refine your pitch. I feel like I have a much better handle on this, but there&#8217;s still work to do, and web sites to update.</p>
<p><em>Actually sell some copies.</em> I used a coupon code to track sales. During the conference my sales were flat, but in the weeks since I&#8217;ve had the best sales days of Clipstart ever.</p>
<p><em>Get exposure in the press.</em> Check, was interviewed by Ryan Ritchey for &#8220;The Digital Lifestyle&#8221;:http://thedigitallifestyle.tv/home/2010/2/12/wii-transfer-at-macworld-2010.html, Merlin Mann for &#8220;MacBreak Video&#8221;:http://www.pixelcorps.tv/macbreak301, and talked with other members of the press on the show floor. I should have done more but lacked the energy.</p>
<p><em>Win best of show award.</em> Nope, but wasn&#8217;t expecting it. I think it&#8217;s a shame that only one Mac application won, but on the flip side it&#8217;s great that it was &#8220;Inklet&#8221;:http://tenonedesign.com/inklet.php. Really cool app.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s expectations coming into the event were low &mdash; the previous exhibitors who backed out, the attendees who wrote Macworld off, and the press who questioned the show&#8217;s relevance. But clearly Macworld 2010 was a success. The second day of the expo I was late to the show floor, arriving just a few minutes before they opened the hall. There was a huge mass of people waiting to get in.</p>
<p>There will be a Macworld 2011. I&#8217;m really excited to see how it works to move the whole expo and conference to Moscone West. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll be there yet, since as demonstrated this year I can&#8217;t plan nearly that far in advance. Throwing all of this together 2 weeks before the show only worked because of everyone who made things a little easier during the week.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jason Snell, Merlin Mann, Adam Lisagor, and everyone else who stopped by and waited patiently through my demos; also Guy English, Paul Kafasis, David Barnard, John Fox, John Chaffee, the RogueSheep guys, my booth buddies from &#8220;Hello Chair&#8221;:http://hellochair.com/appsaurus/, and the other indie developers I&#8217;m forgetting; and especially Albert McMurry, Dan Moren, and John Gruber for telling people about Clipstart. It succeeds only because of word of mouth.</p>
<p>In closing&#8230; Maybe it&#8217;s because James Cameron is still in the news, but I&#8217;ve always loved this line from the character Rose in Titanic: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make any sense. That&#8217;s why I trust it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s mostly how I felt about exhibiting at Macworld. Even though it was &#8220;cheap&#8221; by tradeshow standards, for me it was real money and a risk. I booked my flight the day I realized that the only reason not to go was because I could fail.</p>

			<p>I started this blog exactly 8 years ago today, right before SXSW, so I thought I&#8217;d post about something related to the event. This year Gowalla and Foursquare are going to be huge. I was a little late to the location-based game party, initially being turned off by Foursquare when it asked for my phone number just to register, but over the last 6 months I&#8217;ve been thoroughly enjoying using Gowalla.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeff Croft has a detailed breakdown&#8221;:http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2010/mar/08/foursquare-versus-gowalla-round-two/ of the differences between Gowalla and Foursquare:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gowalla is capable of having spots which are not addressable, and which are very precise points on the Earth&#8217;s surface. This, again, points to its geocaching nature. You can create a spot for that really wicked tree in your favorite park, or your mailbox, or the trash dumpster where your favorite bum spends most of his days.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of Gowalla&#8217;s best features. I also prefer its design, and the playful personality they&#8217;ve baked into the app. While I agree with Jeff that there doesn&#8217;t need to be one winner, I&#8217;m not interested in checking in with more than one application every time I visit a spot, so I use Gowalla exclusively. And because I have friends at Gowalla, I want them to succeed.</p>
<p>My message to Foursquare users who are coming into town for SXSW: Gowalla is an Austin-based company and they are &#8220;doing fun stuff for SXSW&#8221;:http://gowalla.com/sxsw. Why not give Gowalla a try for the weekend?</p>

			<p>When &#8220;the iPad commercial&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/ipad/gallery/#hardware06 popped up during the Oscars, I thought it captured the power and elegance of the device extremely well. But as I commented on Twitter, after repeat viewings you can see that it&#8217;s probably faked. The iPad must have been filmed on a stand or table and then composited into the shot later.</p>
<p>Contrast this to &#8220;Cabel Sasser&#8217;s&#8221;:http://www.cabel.name/2006/03/nintendo-ds-lite-first-look.html video of the Nintendo DS Lite, which was a faithful presentation of how the game system feels to use and yet still &#8220;sold people on the device&#8221;:http://twitter.com/shauninman/status/10175596516.</p>
<p>Apple stretches the truth with all the iPod and iPhone ads and it never bothered me before, but this one seems wrong. How it feels to hold an iPad will be the difference between a good product and a great one. Can you hold it still with one hand? How easy is it to rotate it? What is the angle like when propping it on your legs?</p>
<p>This is a pretty minor complaint &mdash; I&#8217;ll be pre-ordering my iPad this Friday regardless and couldn&#8217;t be more excited &mdash; but I wish Apple didn&#8217;t feel the need to lie about such an important part of the product.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Wil Shipley on Apple&#8217;s decision&#8221;:http://wilshipley.com/blog/2010/03/open-letter-to-steve-jobs-concerning.html to be aggressive on their iPhone patents:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But when you sue someone for doing something you do yourself, you become one of the bad guys. Can you name a company _you_ admire that spends its time enforcing patents, instead of innovating? Remember the pirate flag you flew over Apple&#8217;s headquarters when you were building the Mac?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And &#8220;my tweet on this&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/status/9886138112 from yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This iPhone preemptive patent war is going to backfire. You&#8217;re losing the battle for our hearts and minds, Apple.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether Apple wins this patent lawsuit or not doesn&#8217;t even matter; the old Apple many of us fell in love with is dead and maybe never coming back. I still want to think of Apple as the company that fights the good fight, innovating and putting user experience first. But you have the App Store exclusivity and rejections, and now you have the patents.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame they&#8217;ve gone so far off course. Regardless of market share and billions in revenue, I&#8217;ll always hold Apple to a higher standard than every other mega corp, and hope not just for better products but also for leadership and doing what&#8217;s right.</p>

<p>I first met Dan Benjamin in 2005, at an off-site meeting for <a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/">VitalSource</a> in Telluride, Colorado. I don&#8217;t remember much of what we talked about over the course of those few days, but what I do remember, as the team was riding in the back of a jeep heading up the mountains, is that <em>he kept talking about radio and podcasting</em>.</p>
<p>In the five years since then he&#8217;s started a couple successful podcasts, and now he&#8217;s launched something bigger: <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/introducing-5-by-5-studios/">a podcast network called 5 by 5</a> with a strong lineup of new shows.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I started planning. I didn&#8217;t want to do it part time or half way &mdash; I wanted to do this <em>for real</em>, meaning full-time. I wanted to create an Internet-based broadcast network, a place where I could create and host shows for myself and with my friends.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I love seeing someone&#8217;s passion, only loosely related to how they earn a living, go from something in the back of their head to a full core business. Good luck, Dan. It&#8217;s off to a great start.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Brent writes a fair post&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2010/02/26/on_switching_away_from_core_data on when Core Data is great and when it&#8217;s a performance bottleneck:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I optimized as much as I could, spent tons of time in Shark, went all multi-threaded with Core Data, switched away from my own queuing system to NSOperationQueue, optimized the XML parsing, etc. But performance and memory use on my first-generation iPod Touch (my development test device) was still not nearly good enough with a big unread count (of around 10,000 items).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If I had been writing that post I probably wouldn&#8217;t have praised Core Data as much as he did, although admittedly because I rarely use it, and not at all in any shipping applications. Its approach always seemed slightly wrong to me.</p>
<p>My main reason for sticking with SQL directly is that I know by coding at this lower level &mdash; with my own lightweight model objects on top of FMDB and utility methods for working with the Clipstart database &mdash; that if something is slow it&#8217;s my fault. I can fix things that are my fault. I can&#8217;t fix fundamental design problems in Apple&#8217;s code.</p>
