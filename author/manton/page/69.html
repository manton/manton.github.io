			<p>I saw the Al Gore documentary &#8220;An Inconvenient Truth&#8221;:http://www.climatecrisis.net/ last month. It&#8217;s a very important movie, and I hope everyone has a chance to see it.</p>
<p>They handed out copies of Seed Magazine at SXSW this year. There were a few articles on global warming, including &#8220;this depressing quote from James Lovelock&#8221;:http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/05/doomsday_scenarios.php, the environmental scientist responsible for the Gaia hypothesis:</p>
<p>bq. &#8220;The prospects for the coming century are pretty grim: If these predictions are correct, it means that all of the efforts that have been made, like the Kyoto and Montreal agreements, are almost certainly a waste of time. They should have been done 50 or 100 years ago. It&#8217;s too late now to turn back the clock, so to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>What are we supposed to do with that? If we are scared and powerless, nothing will change.</p>
<p>The Bush administration agenda too is based on fear. Fear led us to IRAQ, to no-warrant wiretapping. Instead, with An Inconvenient Truth you leave the movie theater inspired, with a new sense of urgency. This is beautifully woven together &#8212; personal highlights from Gore&#8217;s life with his talk with facts with videos.</p>
<p>And as a Mac user, it&#8217;s nice to see &#8220;Keynote played such an important part&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/hotnews/articles/2006/05/inconvenienttruth/ in the production of his talks (via &#8220;James Duncan Davidson&#8221;:http://www.duncandavidson.com/).</p>
<p>Also, this on YouTube: &#8220;A Terrifying Message from Al Gore&#8221;:http://youtube.com/watch?v=5BjrOi4vF24 (Futurama!)</p>

			<p>I write Mac software, but over the last year I&#8217;ve increasingly been building Ruby on Rails web apps as well. Today I finally took a look at &#8220;RubyCocoa&#8221;:http://www.rubycocoa.com/. I wanted to whip up a quick Cocoa app that would involve some text parsing, and a dynamic scripting language like Ruby is a much better fit for text processing than C, C++, or Objective-C.</p>
<p>It turns out RubyCocoa works amazingly well. I have only scratched the surface with a small test app, but I was blown away by its ease-of-use, Xcode integration, example projects, and apparent maturity. You have full access to AppKit from Ruby-based controllers and views, and a single NIB file can even reference both Objective-C and Ruby classes. Fantastic stuff.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s ready for commercial software use yet. For distribution, I tested including the RubyCocoa.framework inside the application package and the app launches and runs correctly on a system without the full RubyCocoa install. There may be issues with requiring a recent version of Ruby, but otherwise it&#8217;s a fully native app.</p>
<p>My only disappointment was in the Objective-C calling conventions. There are two versions to choose from: a style using underscores to separate named values, and a slightly easier Ruby syntax using symbols and extra parameters. Here they are:</p>
<p><em>Objective-C:</em></p>
<p><code>[my_window setFrame:r display:YES animate:YES]</code></p>
<p><em>Ruby Underscores:</em></p>
<p><code>my_window.setFrame_display_animate(r, true, true)</code></p>
<p><em>Ruby Symbols:</em></p>
<p><code>my_window.setFrame(r, :display, true, :animate, true)</code></p>
<p>In my opinion, a better approach would be to take advantage of Ruby&#8217;s trick of allowing the last parameter to be a hash supplied without the curly braces. This feels more readable to me and more closely matches the Objective-C equivalent.</p>
<p><em>Better:</em></p>
<p><code>my_window.setFrame(r, :display => true, :animate => true)</code></p>
<p>In any case, that&#8217;s a minor complaint and doesn&#8217;t take much away from the beauty of writing native Mac apps in Ruby.</p>

			<p>My friend &#8220;John Rubio&#8221;:http://www.johnrubio.com/ has launched a new site: &#8220;CREATEaPro&#8221;:http://www.createapro.com/. A steady flow of good essays is already filling up the site. His latest, &#8220;10 Essential Tips to Becoming a Successful Creative Pro&#8221;:http://www.createapro.com/2006/07/10/10-essential-tips-to-becoming-a-more-successful-creative-pro/, is equally applicable to a wide range of disciplines, not just designers, illustrators, animators, or other artists the site is aimed at.</p>
<p>I like this paragraph from his introductory post:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If I could go back, I would have paid more attention. I would have started my education not then, but at 8, when I first discovered the blackroom they had stashed behind my uncle Richard&#8217;s light table. I would have spent more time studying the racks of lead type before dismissing them as just things that got my hands and homemade clothes covered in ink.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It underscores what seems to be the main theme of the site: get working and stay confident.</p>
<p>Sometimes I worry that I wasted too much time with trivial stuff, pushing away time for what is really important. But then I&#8217;ll encounter an artist or visionary who got a late start and still made the best of it. It&#8217;s never too late.</p>
<p>Unless you listen to &#8220;John Kricfalusi&#8221;:http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2006/05/animation-school-lessons-do-you-want.html: &#8220;After 24 if you haven&#8217;t already become really good, you will stagnate and your powers of learning and your rebellious youthful attitude will have died.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Gillian Carson talks about vacation time&#8221;:http://www.barenakedapp.com/misc/vacation-time on the Amigo blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A holiday is a time for thinking, for relaxing your mind, for drinking beer and laughing and&#8230; for having ideas. The last time we went on holiday we came up with the idea for Carson Workshops, so I have great faith in letting your brain run free.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. Late last night I was working on a problem, something I had been struggling with in my spare time for a couple of weeks. I went back and forth between staring at an empty text editor and reading NetNewsWire. In other words, wasting time. I went out after midnight to get some milk and food for breakfast, and on the drive to the store I let my mind wander until my brain randomly struck upon an elegant solution to my coding problem. Back at my desk I implemented it in 10 lines of code and went to bed.</p>
<p>Have a happy July 4th everyone.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last month I tore down the rotting privacy fence in our backyard and built a new low spaced-picket fence. In addition to just being ugly to look at and nearly collapsed in a few places, the old fence was tall and prevented us from enjoying the space behind our house: essentially a private park owned by a local church but also accessible to the neighborhood.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/155794959"><img src="../../../images/2006/fence_small.html" width="300" height="225" alt="new fence" border="1" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" /></a> It took me a week of part-time work and numerous Home Depot trips to build the new fence, which is about 60 feet across. I was able to salvage the strongest of the existing posts, cutting them off to match the new fence height. The ones that were rotten I removed and replaced by laying several new posts in concrete. I measured and cut each post so that the top of the fence line was level even though the ground slopped up slightly on one side of the yard.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very happy with the way it turned out. It opened the yard up even more than I was hoping for, and the better gate makes it easy to take a walk in the back. Another side effect I had not expected was encountering new people who routinely take their dogs for walks. Having a shorter fence is similar to parking your car in the driveway instead of your garage: you&#8217;ll see your neighbors more if you do.</p>
<p>Anyway, a very rewarding experience. After so much crafting code and pushing pixels, it&#8217;s nice to build something real and see the results. The &#8220;image on Flickr&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/155794959/ is one I took a few evenings ago and shows about half the full fence length.</p>

The last few weeks of a project are always the most stressful, but also the most rewarding as all the pieces start to fall into place. The user interface tightens up and the bugs are found and worked out.</p>
<p>I shut my computer off last night and didn&#8217;t look at it again. Spent a great morning out shopping and at lunch. It&#8217;s a lazy Saturday afternoon &#8212; a holiday weekend, even &#8212; but I have a bit more code to knock out. The new Dixie Chicks CD is playing, iChat is safely in the &#8220;off&#8221; position, and for another hour or so, everything in the world is just fine.</p>

			<p>I was wired when I got back at midnight last Thursday from the late Mission Impossible 3 show with &#8220;Damon&#8221;:http://www.damonclinkscales.com/. A storm had passed over while we were in the theater. Tree branches were down in the neighborhood, and rain continued.</p>
<p>I sat at the dining room table with a sheet of typing paper and a fat red kids crayon and did some characters. It&#8217;s hard to draw small with something so big. These were at least twice the diameter of your standard crayon. I shrunk the result slightly and included a few below because I liked some of the line, despite the otherwise clunkiness.</p>

			<p>When I first heard about the &#8220;United 93 movie&#8221;:http://www.united93movie.com/ I had just about the &#8220;same reaction as Matthew Haughey&#8221;:http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2006/04/buzzplant_none.html. Hollywood only wants to make some quick cash off of other people&#8217;s tragedy. The movie is going to be painful to watch, it won&#8217;t be accurate anyway, and it will be full of sappy, exaggerated nonsense meant to pull at our emotions and our wallets.</p>
<p>I probably said about as much to my television. I only watch a couple hours of TV a week, and a significant portion of that is yelling at advertisements or the local news crew.</p>
<p>But then a few things changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>I heard that the desire to make this movie was more driven by the director than executives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reviews coming in seemed &#8220;very positive&#8221;:http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/united_93/.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I realized that I couldn&#8217;t ignore this movie just because of my overwhelming fear of flying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remembered that after September 11th, <em>I wanted to make a film about it too</em>. (My story was not a &#8220;docu-drama&#8221;, but a short animated film with a fantasy spin on real events in New York City.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, I saw the movie Friday night. As surprising as it may seem, it is very good. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll say anymore than that.</p>

			<p>I love reading about the setup for other Mac users: what kind of desks, computers, and software they use. The full list of applications usually overlaps quite a bit with my own Dock, but every once in a while there is some new app that I am not using, but should be. And there are always the two killer apps that provide the most insight into how a user works: email and text.</p>
<p>Are they a long-time Mac user who can&#8217;t live without BBEdit? Do they use Mail.app but secretly wish that it was better?</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan starts off his post&#8221;:http://hivelogic.com/articles/2006/04/17/setup_part_ii with TextMate, which has quickly taken over the Mac Rails community. Despite a rocky 1.0, I gave TextMate a second try with 1.5 and have enjoyed using it. There is some very powerful stuff in it, some of which never clicked for me until I watched &#8220;this screencast of snippets in action&#8221;:http://macromates.com/screencast/scopes_and_comments.mov.</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t use TextMate for everything. There are three text editors always running on my machine, and I don&#8217;t see that changing anytime soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>TextMate: My new default for general-purpose editing, and Ruby on Rails projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xcode: Needed for C++ and Objective-C because of the integration with the debugger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BBEdit: Great for batch grep processing and multiple-file diff.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On a whim a few nights ago I tried to use TextMate for editing even C++ and Objective-C. It&#8217;s trivial enough to configure Xcode to use TextMate as its default editor (in Xcode, look under Preferences &#8594; File Types), and I was happily surprised that you can even run builds from within TextMate out of the box. If you have a TextMate project in the same directory as your Xcode project, the build will just work. If not, you can manually point TextMate to your Xcode project by clicking the &#8220;i&#8221; icon in the drawer when no files are selected, then add the shell variable TM_XCODE_PROJECT that points to a full path to your project.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I could only keep this setup for one night before I had to abandon it. Without breakpoint support or any integration with the debugger (impossible), it breaks the workflow cycle of testing and fixing bugs quickly.</p>

<p>The first, to fulfill a <a href="../../../2006/01/new_year.html">new year&#8217;s resolution</a> that died before February. I rearranged my office and drawing desk yesterday to make everything more accessible, and I was doodling last night when this silly little bunny sketch came out. I have a few more drawings and pieces of animation in various states of completion that I&#8217;d like to post too, but I&#8217;m not going to let the backlog of &#8220;finishing&#8221; anything stop me from posting now on a weekly basis. Really.</p>
<p>Secondly, I made a long-overdue server change this weekend. About a year ago I gave up self-hosting on an old Linux box and moved this site and email to <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a>. I had high hopes. It was run by smart people with good ideas, and it was officially endorsed by the Ruby on Rails project.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the server I was hosted on (Bidwell) was down much too frequently. I couldn&#8217;t help comparing it to the near-flawless uptime I had running my own box on a static DSL address. Lots of little problems and broken promises added to the overall frustration. And running underneath the whole mess was an undercurrent of unprofessionalism. I gave them a year to sort it out and it never got better.</p>
<p>Which is too bad, because there was a lot of potential there. I still wish them good luck, and especially to the Joyent team as well.</p>
<p>Today my site is live on <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?175378">DreamHost</a>. I&#8217;ve had mostly good experiences using DreamHost to manage the <a href="http://www.staple-austin.org/">STAPLE! web site</a> in the last two years. Here&#8217;s hoping I won&#8217;t have to switch again anytime soon.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Today marks the 4-year anniversary of this weblog. What better way to celebrate than with a discussion of web applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angrylearner.com/">Willie Abrams</a> said in a recent Campfire chat: &#8220;Web applications automatically have sync.&#8221; He hits on the fundamental principle of web applications popularity, and of course that has always been true. But the difference now is that some web apps are actually <i>fast and usable too</i>. (Gasp!)</p>
<p>The rise of rich web applications that seamlessly mix Flash or Ajax while still staying true to the roots of web architecture (REST design, open standards) has upset the traditional desktop market. I first wrote about this in <a href="../../../2005/12/todo_lists_and.html">&#8220;To-do lists and embracing the network&#8221;</a>, which was in a sense a subtle wake-up call to Mac developers: adapt to the always-on internet or any college drop-out with a shared server will obsolete your app after a few late nights of Rails hacking.</p>
<p>But it frustrates me to see such praise given to web applications that, were they traditional, native apps, they&#8217;d be laughed away to obscurity or ignored. Ajax is a huge advancement, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that every application works well for the web. I&#8217;m sure Google engineers spent an incredible amount of work on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/02/22/google-pages-released/">Google Pages</a>, but compare it to Apple&#8217;s iWeb and it becomes obvious how weak web application interfaces still are.</p>
<p>Luckily some people are working through the really tough problems. <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry">Ray Ozzie&#8217;s Live Clipboard</a> may be the start of a whole new shift in web app functionality, allowing data to move between web sites and even out of the browser. But true drag-and-drop of structured data between a native app and a web site is still a long way off.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make some lists, starting with the good.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good web applications are data-driven, multiuser, and use URLs everywhere.</li>
<li>There is some key component that is about the <i>browsing experience</i>. That might be sifting through large amounts of data, viewing old logs, finding people.</li>
<li>The kind of data requires an adaptable user interface, not something with a strict set of traditional widgets. HTML is perfect for this.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other side are web applications that might be built by a team of smart people and with a great technology backend, but the application concepts are confused. They don&#8217;t know if they belong in a web browser or on the desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mediocre web applications think that a single web browser window is an entire windowing system with movable child windows.</li>
<li>No features that actually have anything to do with the web. The result is that it <i>adds no value</i> to the web as a whole.</li>
<li>Trying to replace the whole Microsoft Office suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something else is changing in the HTML/CSS/JavaScript platform. In 2004, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">Joel Spolsky wrote</a> about how instead of picking Mac, Windows, or Linux APIs, developers are building for the web platform and can deploy to any user&#8217;s desktop. Cutting-edge web applications push that claim to its breaking point, as differences between Safari, Mozilla, and Internet Explorer often cause headaches for developers. It&#8217;s no surprise when Microsoft&#8217;s set of Office Live applications require Internet Explorer, but it <i>is</i> note-worthy when Google&#8217;s chat interface does not work in Safari. There is now a whole set of web applications that require the latest version of Mozilla and won&#8217;t work in anything less.</p>
<p>Five years ago we accepted that web applications were going to be useful but ultimately unfulfilling, joyless experiences. Now most web apps have risen from bad to simply mediocre. The truly great ones have a foundation and design that would still be unrivaled in a desktop app. These amazing apps are not content to reimplement an old application as a web app just to allow use from any machine, but they take it to the next step: rethink the problem, stay agile, and redesign so that it&#8217;s not just web-based, but it&#8217;s <i>actually better</i>.</p>

Founders <a href="http://www.damonclinkscales.com/">Damon</a>, Robert Rasmussen, and <a href="http://www.nonewmessages.com/">Rob Jones</a> have done a great job getting the group off the ground and lining up interesting topics.</p>
<p>Last night was our fourth meeting. <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/batate/">Bruce Tate</a> gave a talk on his experience ramping up a Rails team and comparisons to the Java world. As a new experiment on the agenda, afterwards some of us stuck around to hack together a member directory for the web site. I didn&#8217;t actively participate in the coding efforts, but I had a good time meeting new people. As usual, it was all followed by drinks at Hickory Street Bar &amp; Grill, where topics of discussion ranged from refactoring to Perl to C++ windowing toolkits to AppleGuide. You know there&#8217;s some real substance to Rails when it brings together such a diverse group.</p>
<p>Also just announced: the <a href="http://www.austinonrails.org/articles/2006/02/21/austin-on-rails-happy-hour-at-sxsw">Rails Happy Hour at SXSW</a>. Should be fun.</p>

			<p>Everyone complains about software bloat. And it&rsquo;s easy to see why &mdash; applications are bigger and slower than they&rsquo;ve ever been, and users think the dozen features they will never use are to blame.</p>
<p>On the Mac we are lucky to have a large number of great, small, focused tools that solve a few problems well. The best of these become successful, but what then? You have to keep adding features. How do you control the software so that it becomes even more useful without feeling too packed?</p>
<p>One way is to differenciate between visible and hidden bloat. For example, Microsoft products used to have a tendency to take every major bullet point on the side of the box and make a toolbar icon for it. Even if the user only uses 5% of those features, they have easy access to far too many of them, and they needlessly have access to them all at once.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2006/keynote_sides.gif" border="0" height="147" width="215" alt="Keynote slider" align="right" /> Instead, adding features <i>in context</i> allows the application to grow without feeling too busy, and without distracting the user from the core set of features they are familiar with. The new user interface is discovered by using a new feature, and otherwise remains out of sight.</p>
<p>This point was really emphasized for me while using Keynote 3 the other day. I love the contextual floating slider when editing a shape (see image). They could have put this slider in the inspector window, but it is so infrequently used it would have remained disabled most of the time, and cluttered those panes with little benefit.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been living in <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> quite a bit over the last few days. It&rsquo;s a great app, well designed and very fast. But it suffers from a problem that iChat and other AIM clients do not have: it&rsquo;s easy to forget about a chat room while working on something else because there&rsquo;s no audio or visual notification that you missed a message.</p>
<p>I whipped up a tiny AppleScript that monitors the chat and beeps if there have been any changes. It&rsquo;s simple but it works fine for me, and should make do until someone writes a full WebKit-based Campfire client app with more options, or until 37signals releases a supported public web services API.</p>
<p>Requirements and how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires Safari. Does not work with Firefox or Camino.</li>
<li>Campfire must be in its own web browser window, or the front tab in any window.</li>
<li>Every 2 seconds, it grabs the HTML from the &lt;div&gt; that Campfire uses for the chat messages. If it has changed since the last time, it beeps.</li>
<li>Only beeps if Safari is not the frontmost application.</li>
<li>If you are in multiple chat rooms, only works if they are in their own window and visible on screen.</ul>
<p>Download: <a href="../../../software/scripts/Campfire_Beep.dmg">Campfire_Beep.dmg</a> (90K)</p>
<p>Just open the application in Script Editor to edit it. Or view the <a href="../../../software/scripts/Campfire_Beep.html">full source</a>.</p>
<p>Comments? Email <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">manton@manton.org</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> I updated the script so that it doesn&#8217;t display errors, more correctly identifies URLs, and supports multiple open Campfire chat windows.</p>
<p><b>This just in:</b> 37signals added sound notification to Campfire today! So this little AppleScript is officially obsolete. I&#8217;d like to take credit for convincing them that such a feature was needed, but we all know how they love to build features that won&#8217;t roll-out until the 2nd week after launch. :-)</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-012406pixar_lat,0,67769.story?coll=la-home-headlines">It was made official today</a>. The rumor only surfaced a week ago, but in that time many people have gone from surprise and skepticism to hope that maybe it could be great for both companies. For Pixar, it might mean more creative control over their characters and sequels, plus not having to worry about distribution or settling for a partner without the reach into merchandising and vacation spots that Disney has. Interestingly, John Lasseter will also advise on new theme park attractions.</p>
<p>In the old days under Walt, it was common for artists to move between short films, features, and Disneyland design. Walt had a knack for seeing the best skills in people and using them wherever they could be most effective. He also had an instinct for story, a relentless pursuit of quality, and of what people would want to see, or how to sell it. Steve Jobs shares more than a few of these qualities, even if his management style at Pixar has been to delegate more than micromanage. Could Jobs pull another NeXT and infuse Disney with Pixar management and culture, or will he be content to sit on the board and coordinate deals with Apple for video content? Who knows.</p>
<p>For Disney, the benefits of the deal are pretty obvious, since all of the Pixar films have been huge money-makers. What&#8217;s less clear is what will happen to all the films currently in production at Disney. We have to assume they will continue mostly unchanged. Disney had a rough and controversial transition to 3d, with many layoffs and studio closures, but they did make the transition and this deal will probably upset that just a little.</p>
<p>There is also still that dream that with a leader (Lasseter) who appreciates traditional 2d animation, Disney might even buy back some of those old animation desks and give 2d another try. Although some of the great directors of the 2nd golden age at Disney have left (such as Ron Clements and John Musker of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin), Disney still has many 2d-trained directors, and now so does Pixar (Brad Bird), with enough 2d fans throughout both companies to form another studio branch entirely.</p>
<p>I read a bunch of weblogs by artists at Disney and Pixar now, so hopefully their views will start to trickle in too. Good luck to everyone at both studios.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>One of the first things you notice when you have kids is how bad the toys are. Everything is electronic, makes too much noise, and is quickly discarded when the batteries run out or when everything you could possibly do with the toy is exhausted. The great toys are the ones that allow an infinite number of possibilities. Each game experience is different, whether it&#8217;s building something new with blocks, or play-acting a different story with dolls.</p>
<p>How do you tell the difference between a great toy and a bad one? If the toy is made to do a few specific amazing things, with a bunch of bullet points and exclamation marks on the side of the box, be weary of it. For example, modern LEGOs come in all sorts of pre-molded shapes. If you buy the pirate set, it will be great fun for the first few days until you realize that it can only be a pirate ship. But if you buy a bucket of LEGOs (yes, they still sell these), you can build a pirate ship one day and a barn the next. Even better, toys should interoperate with one another, something that feels forced if the types of toys are so specifically designed that they don&#8217;t fit well together.</p>
<p>This is especially true for younger children. Visiting the Waldorf School last year they used the example of a silk scarf. It can be a cloak, hat, river, cloud, hair, bed, rope, or the wind. A scarf seems so limited, but it&#8217;s the extreme simplicity that gives it life through a child&#8217;s creativity.</p>
<p><a href="http://keithlango.blogspot.com/2005/08/shining-thru-clouds.html">Keith Lango discusses limitations</a> in animating a scene: &#8220;The next time you have a scene and you&#8217;re told all the limitations that come with it find the thrill of making it work great anyhow. [&#8230;] Let the limitations be your friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one knew whether the original Star Wars (episode 4) would be a success or not. George Lucas used what cheats he could to make the special effects work, forcing himself to be creative within the confines of the budget and limitations of technology at the time. Instead the focus was on the characters and on the story. Twenty years later, with the huge budget of the prequel films, one could argue that he was so distracted with what he <i>could</i> do that the important lessons of what made the first film a success were forgotten.</p>
<p>37signals talks about <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/less_as_a_competitive_advantage_my_10_minutes_at_web_20.php">constraints and doing more with less</a>. I agree with that, but there&#8217;s something else. Some of the greatest software out there is designed in such a way that it can be used for purposes that the designers and programmers did not intend. The software introduces simple concepts that can be stacked and rearranged not unlike those LEGOs. There may be an implied workflow but it is not enforced. Instead maybe the interface flows around documents, which can be named anything and stored in any structure. Or maybe there is an editer that was written for one general purpose but which is simple enough that it also allows editing of other formats.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been pushing for what they call an inductive user experience. It is task-based, context-specific interfaces that attempt to remove the bloated menu and toolbar clutter that the Office apps are known for. The latest phase of this is the Office 12 user interface, which introduces ribbon controls. Microsoft has been going down this path for years though, trying to expose features to the user that would otherwise be lost and buried. They are learning from what works about the discoverability of web applications.</p>
<p>But you want to be careful to not force a certain workflow on the user in these cases, because by doing so the abstract usefulness of the software could be crippled. You don&#8217;t want to go too modal or too restrictive. That&#8217;s one of the reasons wizard-like interfaces were annoying. It&#8217;s not just the idiot-proofing that bugs people, it&#8217;s that there may be some truly useful features hidden behind those &#8220;easy to use&#8221; screens, waiting for a UI to come along and let users use the features on their own terms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, GarageBand is a good example of a focused app (create or record music) that also had broader uses (edit and mix any audio file), which allowed Apple to go one step further and embrace what the rest of us without guitars and keyboards were using it for (podcasts). Basecamp is another flexible app that works because 37signals made the conscious decision to make communication the center of project management, above timelines and charts. Flickr, Odeo, 43 Things, and other so-called Web 2.0 apps will be successful not because of a string of buzzwords, but because they take a very simple concept (&#8220;upload photos&#8221;, &#8220;write goals&#8221;), mix in some communication and sharing, and build it in a way that encourages many different uses.</p>
<p>Most software is just like poorly designed children&#8217;s toys. It might solve one problem well for a time, but it is eventually discarded when it fails to evolve with the user&#8217;s needs. Simple software that solves broad problems can be used for a variety of tasks, and is small enough that it can continue to be improved or integrated well with other applications.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>There is something about <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/">Ta-da List</a> that works really well. Simple things like hitting return to save one to-do item and start a new one, tidying up of completed lists, and automatic ordering of recent lists. And above all else, speed. It is without question the fastest web app I use. Because the application is so focused, even full page reloads are faster in Ta-da than AJAX requests in some other web apps.</p>
<p>These are seemingly simple things, but they add up to an app that rivals any native (Mac or Windows) to-do list software. It makes me wonder how great a native app could be if someone put the same thought into user interface and simple workflow that Ta-da has. The advantage so-called Web 2.0 apps have over native apps is that they are inherently client/server based, but a native application could embrace the network in the same way and (maybe) provide a superior user experience. I&rsquo;ve yet to see any apps that do this effectively, but it will have to happen if the desktop hopes to stay relevant for anything except tasks that benefit from large local storage (e.g. Photoshop and Final Cut Pro).</p>
<p>I use Ta-da List for everything now. Here&rsquo;s a sample of recent lists:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td><a href="../../../images/2005/nanowrimo_tada.gif"><img src="../../../images/2005/nanowrimo_tada_small.gif" border="0" height="232" width="150" alt="NaNoWriMo" /></a></td>
<td><a href="../../../images/2005/cap10k_tada.gif"><img src="../../../images/2005/cap10k_tada_small.gif" border="0" height="232" width="150" alt="Capital 10k" /></a></td>
