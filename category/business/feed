				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/03/episode-18-waiting-for-the-se/">On episode 18</a> of my Timetable podcast, which I just published this morning, I mention the new Nintendo game Miitomo. Federico Viticci <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/miitomo-for-ios-goes-live-internationally/">also wrote about it today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <a href="https://www.macstories.net/?s=Miitomo">I’ve been keeping an eye on Miitomo</a> – I still don&#8217;t completely understand it, but I&#8217;m intrigued by the premise of a friend-based network with mini-games and the ability to collect coins. Those coins can then be used to claim rewards and redeem other Nintendo-related content such as games and customizations. I&#8217;m curious to see how Miitomo will perform outside of Japan.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For a several years between 2006 and 2010, I sold and actively worked on a little Mac app called <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/">Wii Transfer</a>. It was the first time I realized that I could make a living selling Mac software, even though it didn&#8217;t always have great sales consistently by itself. To this day, one of the features I’m most proud to have ever written is the Mii export, which could sync Mii data over Bluetooth from the Wii remotes and render it to let you save your Miis as PNG files on your Mac.</p>
<p>I’ve often mused on Core Intuition that I stopped selling the app too soon. At one point I worked on a companion app to the Nintendo DS with similar themes, but didn’t ship it. And I considered building a version for iOS just with the Mii functionality.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/05/saying_goodbye_to.html">From a blog post in 2012</a>, announcing that Wii Transfer would no longer be available:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m retiring Wii Transfer to focus on my other apps. It’s not that it doesn’t sell; it still does. It’s just that it’s not an app I actually use anymore. By officially shelving the whole project, I hope to remove a psychological burden of sorts — to no longer worry that I’m ignoring an active product.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll never know if it was a missed opportunity — a mistake for the direction of my indie business to stop selling something that people liked — or the right call to refocus around what I actually cared about. In any case, I&#8217;m glad Nintendo is doing something new with Miis. As I play with Miitomo, there&#8217;s a part of me that regrets not doing more with Nintendo-compatible software while I had a competitive head start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned when <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/10/core-intuition-202-and-thoroughly-considered-and-stickers.html">I first linked to Studio Neat’s Obi project on Kickstarter</a>, I enjoyed the Thoroughly Considered podcast that came out of that endeavor. It’s now one of my favorites.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.relay.fm/tc/10">the latest show</a>, Dan and Tom and Myke talk about the press: getting press for your product, communicating with press folks, and the impact of being featured in the press. Because Studio Neat makes physical products and not just software, their take on these topics is always good.</p>
<p>While I’ve blogged from time to time about the press, there’s a lot that I get wrong or don’t make time for. I was impressed with David Barnard’s promotion for <a href="http://randoapp.co/">Rando</a>, a new iPhone app that was a joint venture with David, designer <a href="https://twitter.com/rickmesser">Rick Messer</a>, and <a href="http://jonhays.me/">Jonathan Hays</a> and Ryan DeVore from Silverpine Software. The app got a lot of great press coverage. Even the reviewers who weren&#8217;t convinced they&#8217;d use the app couldn’t help but recommend that readers download it. Not just because of its novelty, but because David framed the app with such a clear story.</p>
<p>Self-promotion is hard for many of us. I try to remind myself that journalists <em>want something interesting to write about</em>. The community as a whole benefits when writers have good stories and developers have good traffic to their apps.</p>
<p>One of the approaches I’ve been trying with my upcoming microblog platform is to write about related topics for months before the project is officially announced. It’s great because these are things I would want to write about anyway, regardless of having an app to promote, and so the heightened level of interest from beta testers and bloggers is like a bonus. Now I just have to actually ship the product while the timing is right.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The folks at Realmac have been <a href="http://blog.typed.com/">blogging about their progress with Typed.com</a>, a new blogging platform that successfully raised $120k on Indiegogo last year. In the <a href="http://blog.typed.com/posts/typed-monthly-report-january-2016">latest monthly report</a>, they announce a new free tier:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With this new free tier, people can sign-up, use the service, take their time. They can blog for free, for as long as they want, and when they need or want the extra features we offer they can upgrade to a paid account. We also think this will be free marketing for the service, the more blog out there that are hosted with Typed.com then more people will find out about the service.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>This blog is in the spirit of <a href="https://open.buffer.com/">Buffer’s open blog</a> or <a href="https://ghost.baremetrics.com/">Ghost’s Baremetrics reports</a>. It’s especially great to see a company sharing numbers when they know they still have a lot of growth ahead of them to get where they want to be.</p>
<p>If you’d like to start a new blog but aren’t sure where to host it, <a href="http://www.typed.com/">check it out</a>. Typed.com has a well-designed admin UI that is refreshingly simple compared to much of the more bloated web software out there.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to use Typed.com as a microblog. I pointed to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/microblogging-with-typed-com.html">some tips for this last year</a>. Since the title of a post can’t be blank on Typed.com, I suggest using a date/time for the title. My new microblog platform is smart about treating those kind of short posts correctly when reading from an RSS feed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s a lot of great stuff in <a href="https://panic.com/blog/the-2015-panic-report/">Panic’s 2015 report</a>, but I’m especially struck with how well they executed on updates. This is something that successful companies get right, and which I still struggle with: continuing to make each app just a little better, with bug fixes throughout the year, instead of getting completely sidetracked with new projects. Cabel writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Not only did we release great things, but I feel we demonstrated dramatic dedication to our apps — we released the most high-quality, bug-free updates in our history.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The product update grid that accompanies the report really underscores this:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2016/panic_updates.png" width="500" height="436" alt="Panic versions" /></center></p>
<p>Congratulations, Panic. I’ve been using the new Coda for iOS on my iPad Pro and it’s excellent.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was confused at first by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=01152016a">Apple&#8217;s iAd announcement to developers</a>. I read it as iAd completely shutting down, but apparently it&#8217;s just the &#8220;app network&#8221;. Still, it&#8217;s a welcome setback for those of us who were never fans of iAd.</p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/01/15/iad">John Gruber</a> doesn&#8217;t think Apple&#8217;s heart is really in it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;When iAd launched, its biggest advocate among Apple’s leadership was Scott Forstall. In some ways I’m surprised it took this long for them to pull the plug. After Forstall, I don’t think anyone’s heart was in this.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. Back in 2010, I said that <a href="http://www.manton.org/2010/09/i_hope_iad.html">I hope iAd fails</a>. It seemed at odds with Apple&#8217;s focus as a product company, not to mention <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/iad-hypocrisy.html">hypocritical</a> for a company with ad-blocking APIs. Apple and third-party developers should be united in encouraging users to pay for apps; iAd is a distraction from that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard <a href="http://blog.sketchapp.com/post/134322691555/leaving-the-mac-app-store">the news about Sketch</a>. I found this section of their announcement the most interesting, because it highlights that this isn&#8217;t just about technical and strategic problems with the Mac App Store, but also about having a direct relationship with the customer to provide the best experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Over the last year, as we’ve made great progress with Sketch, the customer experience on the Mac App Store hasn’t evolved like its iOS counterpart. We want to continue to be a responsive, approachable, and easily-reached company, and selling Sketch directly allows us to give <em>you</em> a better experience.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Sketch joins <a href="https://dancounsell.com/articles/not-on-the-mac-app-store">a growing list</a> of apps unavailable in the store. From <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/12/01/sketch-leaves-mac-app-store">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Sketch isn’t the first big name professional app to be pulled from the Mac App Store (Bare Bones Software’s <a href="http://www.barebones.com/store/macappstore.html">BBEdit</a>, Panic’s <a href="https://panic.com/blog/coda-2-5-and-the-mac-app-store/">Coda</a>, <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/11/24/quicken-2015-switches-from-mac-app-store-to-direct-updates/">Quicken</a>, just to name a few). But Sketch is the poster child for Mac App Store era professional Mac software. It’s the sort of app Apple might demo in a keynote — and the winner of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-2012-apple-design-award-winners/">an Apple Design Award</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/sketch-is-leaving-the-mac-app-store/">Federico Viticci writes</a> that Apple has to do something:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The simple reality is that, gradually, developers of the best apps for OS X are finding it increasingly hard to justify doing business on the Mac App Store. I hope Apple also sees this as a problem and starts doing <em>something</em> about it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Daniel and I talked about this <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/11/episode-207-pretty-please-apple/">on Core Intuition recently</a>. Developers have been complaining about the Mac App Store for years without seeing any progress. It was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html">over 3 years ago</a> that I pulled my app Clipstart from the Mac App Store to sell direct-only instead, because of my concerns about adapting to sandboxing.</p>
<p>All this time, Apple could have been iterating on the Mac App Store, improving sandboxing entitlements, improving review times, customer interaction, and more. Yet they have not. At this point, Apple can&#8217;t just do &#8220;something&#8221;. They can&#8217;t just improve the Mac App Store a little. They have to <em>significantly</em> improve it, addressing many issues at once. And even then, some of these great apps — Sketch, BBEdit, Coda, RapidWeaver — may not come back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s March 2009, the height of SXSW in Austin before the conference gets too big for itself. I&#8217;m hanging out downtown with tech folks from a blogging startup, having dinner and beers before we head to the party they&#8217;re putting on. The CTO, one of the first employees at the company, is talking about Memcache servers and MySQL scaling, and I&#8217;m hanging on every word. I love this stuff.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Mac and iOS developer, but I often take a break from native app development to work on server software. So I&#8217;m asking him about MySQL replication and what it&#8217;s like to run a schema migration without the database falling over. The conversation sometimes shifts back to Apple platforms, and he says he&#8217;s been thinking about going to WWDC. I had been attending WWDC for a while, so I say sure, it&#8217;s expensive but you should consider it. If you&#8217;re doing more web stuff, though, maybe it&#8217;s not as important that you attend.</p>
<p>We walk over to the party venue. It&#8217;s bigger and more crowded than he thought it would be. Their company has really taken off, growing well beyond the early days when it was just him and the founder trying to build something new. And it&#8217;s at this point that he turns to me and asks a question that brings us back to iOS development:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;So what do you think of my app, Instapaper?&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>In answer to Marco Arment, at that time the CTO of Tumblr, I mutter something about liking it, but I haven&#8217;t really gotten it into my workflow yet. Hopefully whatever I said was encouraging. In subsequent years, of course, Instapaper would be one of my favorite apps.</p>
<p>Later, replaying these conversations, I realized that I asked the wrong questions and gave the wrong advice. About WWDC, I should have said &#8220;Yes, absolutely!&#8221; with an exclamation point. Buy a ticket. If you can&#8217;t afford it, go anyway because you need to be there.</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t say that because I wasn&#8217;t listening closely enough. I was so busy asking questions about Tumblr, that I wasn&#8217;t listening to the excitement in his voice about Instapaper. I was so busy thinking about server scaling and databases and all this other stuff that I could&#8217;ve learned from a book, that I didn&#8217;t hear what he was really saying.</p>
<p>I should have asked about iOS pricing, free versions, sales, UI design, who did the icon, what does the private API look like. But I didn&#8217;t ask those things because I missed the big picture, how dominant the App Store would become for distribution, and so I missed what mattered. I&#8217;d like to think that since then I&#8217;ve gotten better at listening.</p>
<p>Daniel Jalkut and I had Marco as a special guest on <a href="http://coreint.org/200">Core Intuition 200</a> not just because he&#8217;s a friend but also because he so well represents the goal that many of us have and our listeners have — to start our own company, to find success not just one time but again and again, and to have as thoughtful an approach as possible in the craft of software development.</p>
<p>This week I&#8217;m in Indianapolis for the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/">Release Notes conference</a>. While I will have <a href="https://twitter.com/riverfold/status/651509114284044288">some stickers</a> for anyone interested in my new microblogging platform, and I&#8217;ll probably ramble about it at some length if asked, I&#8217;ll also be listening. I&#8217;ll be listening because you never know which random developer you just met will end up doing their best work in the years ahead, and you want to be as encouraging as possible, offer the right kind of feedback, and also learn from their perspective.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a great line in the Pixar movie Ratatouille:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Not everyone can become a great artist. But a great artist can come from anywhere.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that&#8217;s equally true for developers. We often see someone go from nothing to a top app in the App Store. We often see someone start without an audience and then make friends on Twitter and blogs through the quality of their writing alone. And so we welcome new voices all the time if they&#8217;re respectful.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been some debate about <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/10/13/pragmatic-pricing">Overcast 2.0&#8217;s patronage model</a>. Some of the discussion is healthy — how does a successful business model for one developer apply to other apps? — and some of the discussion is divisive. Instead of asking the right questions, it&#8217;s easy to jump straight to a <em>conclusion</em> with the dismissive statement: &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Marco, but his approach would never work for other developers&#8221;.</p>
<p>The &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Marco&#8221; attitude is poison for our community because it takes the opposite approach as that Ratatouille quote above. It implies that some developers have such an advantage that the rest of us shouldn&#8217;t even bother, because it&#8217;s not a level playing field. It&#8217;s true that some developers today have an advantage, whether through good timing or just a long history of shipping apps, but the lesson isn&#8217;t to give up; it&#8217;s to instead learn from it, and look at our own strengths. What small head start do we have that could grow into a great success tomorrow, too?</p>
<p>Rewind a handful of years, back to that day at SXSW when I could name plenty of developers who had more attention and success in our community than Marco Arment. You can be damn sure that didn&#8217;t discourage him from taking Instapaper from an &#8220;in my spare time&#8221; niche app to the top of the News section on the App Store.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never accept the implied negativity in the &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Marco&#8221; argument. I&#8217;ll never accept that we should be <em>jealous</em> of another developer&#8217;s success instead of <em>inspired</em> by it to do our best work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The flip side to the optimism of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/08/doubt-with-screenshots.html">my last post</a> is the hard reality that sometimes the doubt <em>is</em> warranted. Sometimes, a little caution could lead to better, more reasonable business decisions.</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2015/07/24/in-defense-of-pessimism/">this post from Brett Terpstra</a> about how his wife provides some balance:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “For every wild idea I plan out, she reminds me of the realistic outcomes, backed with historical data. If it weren’t for the tempering quality of having &#8216;pessimists&#8217; around, I’d be living in a tiny apartment, buried in debt, and likely friendless.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to do a better job of bouncing ideas off other people before fully committing, while still holding on to a strong enough original concept that I can&#8217;t get too distracted or discouraged. I also have a new idea to help lay the groundwork for my new microblogging service, before actually shipping it. Hope to announce more in the next couple of weeks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I was writing <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/08/2959.html">some documentation</a> this week, I kept thinking about what makes great marketing copy. 37signals used to say that <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Copywriting_is_Interface_Design.php">copywriting is a form of user interface design</a>. That&#8217;s true but I think there&#8217;s more to it.</p>
<p>The best products don&#8217;t just have marketing copy; they have a mission statement. They don&#8217;t just sell a tool; they sell a movement.</p>
<p>When I stare at my product wondering if it&#8217;s too confusing — if it&#8217;s too different, and tries to do too many things, to be immediately understood by new users — I try to remind myself that it&#8217;s an opportunity. Instead of simply explaining what I&#8217;m doing, how can I pitch it in a way that strengthens a community around the idea. Because dozens of bloggers can spread the idea more quickly and in a more meaningful way than I can by myself.</p>
<p>And unlike a one-way press release, a community is inherently two-way. Every mention of the idea is both marketing <em>and</em> feedback. Someone blogs about how they&#8217;re excited for the product, but also how they wish it had a certain missing feature. Someone in the press writes a review, but also with a pros and cons list.</p>
<p>This cycle means the product gets better. And if we&#8217;re thoughtful in that first approach to marketing copy, then every blog post, review, and tweet that follows is laced with a little part of our mission statement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/two-weeks-notice-the-first-weekend.html">my first post in this series</a> that I need to figure out healthcare for my family now that we’ll no longer be covered under the company’s plan. We spent some time digging into this recently, and basically came away with these points:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are going to be paying significantly more per month than we used to. That is obvious and expected.</li>
<li>Buying through the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">health insurance marketplace</a> is not much different than buying direct through BlueCross BlueShield. Comparing a few plans, the prices seem about the same. Hopefully we’ll get a tax credit discount based on our family size and the fact that I’ll probably be making less money this year.</li>
<li>We will need to stay in a PPO to keep the same doctors. This is non-negotiable for me, even though it will mean higher premiums.</li>
<li>Deductibles will be much higher than what we’ve had so far. The budget will be tight and we can’t justify the crazy-high premium that would be required to lower the deductible and out-of-pocket max. We’re leaning toward some medium-level plan.</li>
<li>It’s too expensive to continue my existing health coverage through COBRA for very long. Switching to a new policy soon makes the most sense. It should be fine to do COBRA for a month or so since we’ve already met our deductible and have a couple doctor visits coming up.</li>
<li>One of the main differences between some of the plans is whether there’s a copay for doctor visits. We are going to prefer plans with a copay and flat prescription drug charge.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re still learning details about this process every day, so some of the above may not end up representing our best options. Just yesterday we realized that there’s some flexibility in what we continue with under COBRA. For example, sticking with existing dental and vision but choosing something else for primary healthcare.</p>
<p>Since it’s already nearly August, I’m trying not to worry too much about these decisions. If we choose poorly, we’ll be stuck with mediocre insurance for a couple months (until my wife starts a new job in the fall and we can consider her group options) or until the end of the year (when the enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act resets).</p>
<p>Related, from 2009: Matt Haughey on <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2009/08/the-entrepreneurial-case-for-national-healthcare.html">the entrepreneurial case for national healthcare</a>. And, more recently: Paul Krugman on <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/paul-krugman-on-the-triumph-for-obamacare.html">the triumph of Obamacare</a>. With everything else to worry about as an indie, at least it appears I won’t have to watch the progress we’ve made on healthcare start to unravel.</p>
