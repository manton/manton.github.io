				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The flip side to the optimism of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/08/doubt-with-screenshots.html">my last post</a> is the hard reality that sometimes the doubt <em>is</em> warranted. Sometimes, a little caution could lead to better, more reasonable business decisions.</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2015/07/24/in-defense-of-pessimism/">this post from Brett Terpstra</a> about how his wife provides some balance:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “For every wild idea I plan out, she reminds me of the realistic outcomes, backed with historical data. If it weren’t for the tempering quality of having &#8216;pessimists&#8217; around, I’d be living in a tiny apartment, buried in debt, and likely friendless.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to do a better job of bouncing ideas off other people before fully committing, while still holding on to a strong enough original concept that I can&#8217;t get too distracted or discouraged. I also have a new idea to help lay the groundwork for my new microblogging service, before actually shipping it. Hope to announce more in the next couple of weeks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I was writing <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/08/2959.html">some documentation</a> this week, I kept thinking about what makes great marketing copy. 37signals used to say that <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Copywriting_is_Interface_Design.php">copywriting is a form of user interface design</a>. That&#8217;s true but I think there&#8217;s more to it.</p>
<p>The best products don&#8217;t just have marketing copy; they have a mission statement. They don&#8217;t just sell a tool; they sell a movement.</p>
<p>When I stare at my product wondering if it&#8217;s too confusing — if it&#8217;s too different, and tries to do too many things, to be immediately understood by new users — I try to remind myself that it&#8217;s an opportunity. Instead of simply explaining what I&#8217;m doing, how can I pitch it in a way that strengthens a community around the idea. Because dozens of bloggers can spread the idea more quickly and in a more meaningful way than I can by myself.</p>
<p>And unlike a one-way press release, a community is inherently two-way. Every mention of the idea is both marketing <em>and</em> feedback. Someone blogs about how they&#8217;re excited for the product, but also how they wish it had a certain missing feature. Someone in the press writes a review, but also with a pros and cons list.</p>
<p>This cycle means the product gets better. And if we&#8217;re thoughtful in that first approach to marketing copy, then every blog post, review, and tweet that follows is laced with a little part of our mission statement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/two-weeks-notice-the-first-weekend.html">my first post in this series</a> that I need to figure out healthcare for my family now that we’ll no longer be covered under the company’s plan. We spent some time digging into this recently, and basically came away with these points:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are going to be paying significantly more per month than we used to. That is obvious and expected.</li>
<li>Buying through the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">health insurance marketplace</a> is not much different than buying direct through BlueCross BlueShield. Comparing a few plans, the prices seem about the same. Hopefully we’ll get a tax credit discount based on our family size and the fact that I’ll probably be making less money this year.</li>
<li>We will need to stay in a PPO to keep the same doctors. This is non-negotiable for me, even though it will mean higher premiums.</li>
<li>Deductibles will be much higher than what we’ve had so far. The budget will be tight and we can’t justify the crazy-high premium that would be required to lower the deductible and out-of-pocket max. We’re leaning toward some medium-level plan.</li>
<li>It’s too expensive to continue my existing health coverage through COBRA for very long. Switching to a new policy soon makes the most sense. It should be fine to do COBRA for a month or so since we’ve already met our deductible and have a couple doctor visits coming up.</li>
<li>One of the main differences between some of the plans is whether there’s a copay for doctor visits. We are going to prefer plans with a copay and flat prescription drug charge.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re still learning details about this process every day, so some of the above may not end up representing our best options. Just yesterday we realized that there’s some flexibility in what we continue with under COBRA. For example, sticking with existing dental and vision but choosing something else for primary healthcare.</p>
<p>Since it’s already nearly August, I’m trying not to worry too much about these decisions. If we choose poorly, we’ll be stuck with mediocre insurance for a couple months (until my wife starts a new job in the fall and we can consider her group options) or until the end of the year (when the enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act resets).</p>
<p>Related, from 2009: Matt Haughey on <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2009/08/the-entrepreneurial-case-for-national-healthcare.html">the entrepreneurial case for national healthcare</a>. And, more recently: Paul Krugman on <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/paul-krugman-on-the-triumph-for-obamacare.html">the triumph of Obamacare</a>. With everything else to worry about as an indie, at least it appears I won’t have to watch the progress we’ve made on healthcare start to unravel.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bookkeepers, accountants, lawyers&#8230; I should get one of those at some point. Instead I seem to waste time moving from one accounting app to another — Xero, QuickBooks Online, <a href="https://lessaccounting.com/">Less Accounting</a> — hoping that the next one will solve everything. Then I go back to tweaking monthly revenue summaries in Numbers because it turns out that spreadsheets are still pretty useful <a href="http://sixcolors.com/post/2015/07/numbered-days-freelance-accounting-with-apples-spreadsheet/">for this sort of thing</a>.</p>
<p>This year I did sign up for what has turned out to be a game-changing app for my business: <a href="https://baremetrics.com/">Baremetrics</a>. I dragged my feet subscribing because it starts at $79/month, but it&#8217;s worth it. The way it breaks down which of your web subscriptions — in my case Searchpath, Watermark, and Tweet Marker — is the most profitable or has the highest customer churn or best average lifetime value&#8230; It was just eye-opening to me and led to finally taking some action to invest in the products that are doing well.</p>
<p>I still have a lot to figure out with this. The one thing I am doing right, on the advice of several folks over the years, is paying myself the same amount once a month from my business checking account, as if it was a normal salary. This helps in forecasting how much income I need in the near-term to keep enough padding in the bank to cover the slow months. It also makes sure I don’t spend everything too quickly.</p>
<p>We haven’t traditionally had the most strict budget. It’s easy to get lazy with finances at a regular job where you seemingly have a never-ending paycheck supply. The freelance or indie software world is quite different. I’m learning quickly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I need to set aside some time to contact folks in the press about my new project. I can tell just explaining the app to my friends that it’s confusing to understand on first glance. It’s different enough from existing social networks that it requires a high-level explanation for why I designed the architecture this way.</p>
<p>The short answer is that I wanted to build something open and extensible. Something that embraced the open web. By necessity that makes the concept a little more geeky than what has come before it. Having reviews of the product out in the wild even before the app is fully released may help get people thinking about what to expect.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time in weeks, we had nothing going on this morning and could sleep in. After a late breakfast I worked on implementing a better trial for my new product, letting the <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/two-weeks-notice-your-business-model-is-wrong.html">business model advice I mentioned yesterday</a> sink in.</p>
<p>Ryan Irelan, who founded <a href="https://mijingo.com/">Mijingo</a> to create books and video courses for developers, <a href="http://ryanirelan.com/2015/07/24/mijingo-mistakes.html">wrote today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;One of my biggest mistakes in my first several months of running Mijingo full-time is that I was going too fast.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I probably needed to hear that. I&#8217;m increasingly worried about launching this new project either half-baked or too late, so I&#8217;ve been trying to ramp up the hours I dedicate to it each week. But I&#8217;m scrambling to quickly change fairly major aspects of it. It may be better to slow down to make sure I still have the bigger picture correct.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be traveling some in August, so that rules out releasing anything brand new before the trip. I&#8217;m thinking my focus leading up to that is to send this to the subscribers of my <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">beta announce list</a> first. Both the free parts and paid plans will be open as if it was a finished product, but it will just be limited to an invite-only group. Based on that feedback I&#8217;ll know how close it really is to shipping for everyone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How is it Friday already? I have just one week left at my regular job. In addition to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/two-weeks-notice-writing-documentation.html">looking at documentation</a>, I talked on a video call with the lead engineer who will take over a couple of my projects. We went over my current bug list (exactly 13 lucky tickets in Jira) and reviewed a few of the trickier outstanding issues.</p>
<p>Nothing like walking through old code, even at a high level, to discover so much outdated cruft that could be redesigned or cleared out. There’s always a little bit of regret: if only I had fixed this one last problem before leaving, or smoothed over this one confusing part of the web UI. But that’s a slippery slope that could go on indefinitely. Web software in particular is evolving and never fully complete.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I continue to get great feedback on my new <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">Riverfold</a> project from the very early beta testers. Bug reports, new ideas, and sometimes a series of questions that basically ends up as: you’re charging the wrong users, what if you tried <em>this completely different way to make money</em> instead?</p>
<p>While I don’t think there’s any direct competition for what I’m building, there are a lot of related services. I’d count even parts of Tumblr and WordPress among the services that are both complementary and in a similar theme to what I want to do. Tumblr makes money primarily through ads. WordPress has ads but (I expect) makes more money through their upgrades: paid custom domains, VaultPress backup, and premium themes.</p>
<p>When choosing a business model for my app, I’ve also been inspired by GitHub’s simplicity. Free for open source projects, which allows you to get a feel for how the entire system works as long as you don’t need private repositories. Paid for organizations, scaling up based on how many projects you have. The success of my project will hang on whether I can mix some of all these models without confusing potential new customers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I worked on some bug fixes to one of the new apps I hope to ship for Riverfold Software. I have just a handful of beta users, but got some good feedback and bug reports last week, things I want to address before opening it up to more users.</p>
<p>When I think of the in-progress apps that I can ship soon to help increase revenue, there are really only 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clipstart 2.0, which will be renamed Sunlit for Mac, to complement the iPhone version.</li>
<li>Unannounced microblogging-related web app, which may also come with iPhone and Mac apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with Sunlit for Mac is that I’m requiring 10.11 El Capitan. So no matter how much progress I make on it, I can’t ship it until Apple releases their next version of Mac OS X. I want to chip away at the new features, but I can’t spend all of my time on it yet. I need to focus attention on projects that have a chance of bringing in additional revenue in the very near future, not by the end of the year.</p>
<p>So the microblogging app — the one I worked on tonight — keeps coming to the front. Since it’s mostly a web app, it has the least number of external API and App Store dependencies that would hold it up. I can ship the core functionality whenever it’s ready. The sooner I get it out the door, the sooner I’ll know if it’s something I can count on as business income.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have some big news to share, so obviously I’m going to write a bunch of blog posts about it. This is the first one.</p>
<p>For a while now I’ve been juggling working on my own projects, with my indie company <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">Riverfold Software</a>, and having a regular job at the education e-book software company VitalSource, where I’ve been <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/02/13_years.html">for over 14 years</a>. As much as I felt like this balance mostly worked, lately it has become clear that the “nights and weekends” approach to Riverfold just isn’t going to be enough time going forward. Last week I resigned from my job at VitalSource to focus on growing Riverfold and shipping new apps this year, some of the most ambitious products I’ve ever tackled.</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to do a series of blog posts about the early part of this transition. For the next couple weeks, as I wind down one set of projects and ramp up new ones, I’m going to post here with the slightly-catchy title prefix “Two weeks notice”. It will be me thinking out loud about the transition, kind of in the informal spirit of <a href="http://inessential.com/vespersyncdiary">Brent’s syncing diary</a>, or like a more serialized version of the <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/25.html">classic indie posts from Gus Mueller</a> and <a href="http://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/09/13/">Paul Kafasis</a>.</p>
<p>But unlike the authors of those posts, I can’t claim to have found success yet. If you take <a href="http://ideveloper.co/podcast081/">Scotty’s definition from the iDeveloper podcast</a>, in fact, I’m not “indie” at all; I expect some percentage of my time will have to be reserved for client projects to help pay the bills. While I used to find that idea distasteful — why give up a consistent salary if you’re not even going to call the shots? — I’ve come to realize that client work can be pretty interesting. The cycle of starting new projects and shipping them is a good way to learn new APIs and iterate on how to build an app from scratch.</p>
<p>While reading all these 2005-era indie blog posts, I was surprised to rediscover that <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/blog/184/the-road-less-traveled">Daniel Jalkut also mentioned</a> mixing in consulting work:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Consulting makes an excellent back-up plan. You’ve always got a job if you need it, and your destiny is very much in your own hands.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course he wanted more than that: to build a great company based around his own apps. I&#8217;m sure Daniel and I will be talking about this on <a href="http://coreint.org">Core Intuition</a> later this week.</p>
<p>So it is a little in the vein of <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/04/16/silverpine-software/">“leap and the net will appear”</a> that I’m moving on from a stable job, where I worked with great developers and friends, to something new that is a lot less certain. I thought that would make for a stressful week, but so far, everything seems okay.</p>
<p>There’s paperwork to do and code to write. There’s health insurance to figure out. But there are also some things that have already been wrapped up. My projects at work are in a good place, hopefully not needing constant maintenance. We just refinanced our house, so that’s a monthly savings, and something that I’m told is difficult without a “real” job.</p>
<p>Friday night I started catching up on some late business taxes (whoops). Saturday I finished editing <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/07/episode-190-they-become-lifelong-fans/">the podcast</a> (which we recorded over a week ago). The rest of the weekend I tried to relax with family (but I worked anyway). It’s Monday now and there’s a busy week ahead. Let’s see how this goes.</p>

<p>Just acknowledging this publicly is progress. It’s now been almost 3 years since my last tweet. I don’t expect to return to Twitter, but I’m still very interested in whether there&#8217;ll be a noticeable change in direction from the new CEO.</p>
