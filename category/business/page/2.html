				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last year I wrote that <a href="../../../2014/11/winding-down-my-twitter-apps.html">I would be removing Tweet Library from the App Store</a> at the end of December, and later said on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/01/episode-168-motorola-68k-forever/">Core Int</a> and in <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetlibrary/status/536910542288338945">a tweet</a> that there would be one last update before the app is gone. It&#8217;s well into January and the old version is still for sale. I&#8217;m over a month behind schedule but still plan to release the updated version and stop selling the app.</p>
<p>On the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/88-theyre-still-your-babies/">latest Release Notes podcast</a> there was a great discussion about when to give up on an app that isn&#8217;t making money, including a mention of my plan with Tweet Library. Joe and Charles talked about why it&#8217;s usually such a bad idea to promise features before you ship, and whether there&#8217;s an obligation to give customers any updates at all.</p>
<p>I pretty much agree with everything they said, but the upcoming Tweet Library 2.7 &#8220;features&#8221; are different. My goal with this release is for the app to be functional and stable for as long possible. I think the app needs better syncing of tweet collections to help future-proof it, to make it easier for customers to move between iOS devices when they upgrade their iPhone or iPad a year from now. For an app that is going away, I should do everything I can to make sure that a customer&#8217;s data is accessible and that import and export are as robust as possible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a reasonable question to ask why I would spend so much time working on something that will essentially bring in no additional revenue. But while it won&#8217;t directly make any money, it probably helped convince some new customers to buy the app over the last month, and it will very likely reduce the support burden for the app over the following year.</p>
<p>I also view it as a sort of parting &#8220;thank you&#8221; to my customers. It&#8217;s just the right thing to do to wrap up the app. <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/the-future-of-unison/">Panic did the same thing</a> when they stopped selling Unison, releasing a major free update at the same time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in picking up a copy of Tweet Library before it&#8217;s too late, you can <a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">buy it on the App Store for $4.99</a>. The new version should ship in early February.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;m the guest on <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2014/11/23/226-workflows-with-manton-reece/">this week&#8217;s Mac Power Users podcast</a>. In addition to workflow and apps I use, the discussion went off the rails a little into the Twitter app ecosystem, especially the fact that I no longer post to Twitter yet still have apps like Tweet Library, Watermark, and the Tweet Marker API that depend on Twitter. For the last 2 years this has been an odd decision on my part; I want to do the right thing for my customers, but I&#8217;m increasingly frustrated with life as a third-party Twitter developer.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/building-a-complete-tweet-index">Twitter announced</a> that they&#8217;ve expanded their search index to include the full history of tweets going back to 2006. I was thrilled by this upgrade to the Twitter service. That the search was so limited for so long was the primary reason I built Tweet Library and Watermark to begin with. Unfortunately, this functionality is only for the official Twitter apps. <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/search-api-the-new-complete-tweet-index-announcement/27883">It will not be made available</a> to third-party developers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for me to wind down development on my Twitter-related apps. I&#8217;ll continue to sell Tweet Library through the end of 2014, then remove it from the App Store. Watermark will also shut down at that time. Because all the tweets stored in Watermark are public tweets (by design it never supported DMs or protected accounts), I will attempt to make the entire Watermark database archive of millions of tweets available publicly. Existing customers can also sync tweets and collections to Dropbox for personal archiving.</p>
<p>Published collections from Tweet Library or Watermark will be maintained indefinitely. No URLs will break, ever. Updating published collections will also continue to work for anyone who already owns Tweet Library.</p>
<p>I will also continue to host the Tweet Marker API, but starting in January I will be more strict about requiring developers to pay for the service. Many developers have been paying for API access for a year (thank you!), but others have missed or ignored my requests to move to a paid plan. It&#8217;s not fair to the Twitter developers who have been paying for Tweet Marker access if some continue get the API for free.</p>
<p>Many friends have told me over the years that I have <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">too many products</a>. But letting any one product go is not easy. There&#8217;s an implicit promise when shipping software that the developer should maintain and improve it for customers. Stopping development on these apps is the right decision and possibly long overdue, but it&#8217;s still difficult. What gives me hope is that it will let me focus on new projects currently in development, which I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about.</p>

			<p>When <a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2014/10/noodlings-the_long_and_winding_road.html">Gus Mueller recently linked</a> to Paul Kim&#8217;s <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/blog/2014/08/29/the-long-and-winding-road/">post on being indie</a>, he called out the section on luck:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;One thing that I did learn is to have a healthy respect for randomness. Luck plays a huge role and you can’t always attribute one’s success or failure solely on their decisions and actions.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118249755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1118249755&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mantonorg&amp;linkId=Q2MNQOANOEQSNRP2">Get Lucky</a> by Lane Becker and Thor Muller. Like half the business books I&#8217;ve bought, I never finished reading the whole thing, but it&#8217;s in the stack on my bedside table and I pick it up every once in a while and read something new. I love the book&#8217;s premise and they&#8217;ve got some great stories.</p>
<p>Most of life is a series of random opportunities. Knowing which ones to skip and which to double-down on makes all the difference.</p>

			<p>We are so lucky in the Mac and iOS developer community that there are a number of ways to be successful. The most common:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work for someone else at their company.</li>
<li>Work for yourself as an indie developer.</li>
<li>Work for clients as a contractor or consultant.</li>
<li>Any mix of the above or all 3.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s no right answer. What works for one developer might be a poor choice for someone else. And throughout our careers, we may move between any of these different paths depending on what life and family require.</p>
<p>Today, Brent Simmons announced that he&#8217;s making one of those moves. <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/09/29/omni">He&#8217;s starting at Omni</a>, and he&#8217;ll continue to work on Vesper as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I love that I get to work on both Vesper and on Omni apps. Omni is one of the great Cocoa development companies, and they’ve grown slowly and steadily over many years. They write lovable productivity apps — not just great iOS apps but also great <em>Mac</em> apps.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Also today, Jon Hays announced that <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/09/29/state-of-the-pines-6-months/">his 6-month-old company SilverPine is doing great</a>, and they&#8217;ve finished a bunch of client projects:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;To say that some days my hair feels like it’s on fire is an understatement. That being said, I wouldn’t trade it for the world. The work we do is creative, challenging, cutting edge and very rewarding.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Congrats to both! Change is exciting. It&#8217;s great to see friends happy doing what they love.</p>

			<p>Great post from Brent Simmons, <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/05/10/what_happened_at_newsgator">recalling his time at NewsGator</a>. On trying to get Nick Bradbury to join them at Sepia Labs, the spin-off that was building Glassboard:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I loved working with Nick in the past, and — even though Nick was an iPhone user and Delphi programmer — I wanted him as our Android developer. Nick was not eager to be on the NewsGator payroll again, but he accepted since we were spinning out into a separate company. And he quickly turned into a great Android developer, as we all knew he would.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s plenty more, about the different stages the company went through from Brent’s perspective. I love posts like this. It’s important to capture the history and culture of tech companies, before our memory fades. And it’s not unlike what Brent has done on a bigger scale for his podcast <a href="http://therecord.co/">The Record</a> with Chris Parrish.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>While doing our taxes this month, I was a little surprised just how much I spend for various web apps and services to help run <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">Riverfold</a>. While I could trim some of them, most are essential and save a lot of time. I thought it would be interesting to write up some of the most important ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=f61c5d1648c72ebcf5bd8175aca79cfe5b374401"><strong>Linode</strong></a>: I’ve moved nearly everything to Linode. I like their style: just basic, solid hosting, with good features but not an overwhelming number of services or fancy stuff. They’ve recently increased their RAM and added SSD. I have servers there for Nginx/Unicorn, MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch. I also use their load balancer and Longview stats app. This link uses <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=f61c5d1648c72ebcf5bd8175aca79cfe5b374401">my referral code</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/"><strong>Amazon Web Services</strong></a>: I no longer use EC2, but I have some DNS hosted in Amazon’s Route 53. I also use S3 for backups and a new feature that’s coming to <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> soon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.heroku.com/"><strong>Heroku</strong></a>: Before moving to Linode, most of my stuff was on Heroku. Now I only have one small app and database there, and I’ll be completely moved off by the end of the year. I’m including it here for completeness only. It’s a great option to get started if you don’t want to be a part-time system administrator, but I think <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/03/27/web-hosting-for-app-developers">Marco sums up nicely why you want to use Linux servers</a> instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://stripe.com/"><strong>Stripe</strong></a>: Can’t say enough good things about Stripe. Watermark, Searchpath, Tweet Marker, and Core Intuition Jobs all use it for credit card processing. It’s the best.</p>
<p><a href="http://gaug.es/"><strong>Gauges</strong></a>: As much as I always loved <a href="http://haveamint.com/">Mint</a>, as my business grew to several web apps and web sites, I looked for a new stats package that could support any number of sites, and which would work better across hosts, since I don’t need to run the database. I’ve been very happy with this.</p>
<p><a href="http://appfigures.com/"><strong>AppFigures</strong></a>: I’ve used this for years to track <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> sales. It’s great. I also like that I can enter other people’s popular apps and get an idea of how they’re trending if they make it to the top lists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blinksale.com/"><strong>Blinksale</strong></a>: Kind of an ancient invoicing app that hasn’t changed at all in years, but it works so I keep using it. Originally started by the folks who would go on to do Gowalla.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.beanstalkapp.com/"><strong>Beanstalk</strong></a>: I moved the source for all my Riverfold projects here because it can do Subversion and Git well. I sometimes wonder if I should move to GitHub instead, since I do use GitHub and have a couple tiny public repositories there, but I like that Beanstalk is focused only on private hosting. No social; just a well-designed web app.</p>
<p><a href="https://postmarkapp.com/"><strong>Postmark</strong></a>: Run by the same team as Beanstalk. I switched to this after Sendgrid had <a href="../../../2013/03/moving_off.html">some PR problems you may remember</a>. Email receipts and whatnot go through Postmark now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/"><strong>Dreamhost</strong></a>: Still using this for email and a few static or PHP sites. It’s cheap and works well. Not much benefit in moving away from it, though I prefer my more important web apps to be hosted on Linode.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnsimple.com/"><strong>DNSimple</strong></a>: I have a few domains here and hope to have all of them moved over eventually. I want to have a single place for DNS. Right now I have registration and DNS hosting spread across Dreamhost, Amazon, and Network Solutions. Makes it difficult to remember where everything is and to keep track of expirations.</p>
<p><a href="https://bufferapp.com/"><strong>Buffer</strong></a>: This company has been on my radar since someone asked me to support it in Tweet Library. They also have a really interesting blog where they share revenue, salaries, subscribers, web traffic, and other usually private details from a company. I admire that a lot. <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel</a> and I use it to automate sending Core Intuition Jobs links to Twitter, App.net, and Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/"><strong>Mapbox</strong></a>: We use Mapbox throughout Sunlit. I wrote more <a href="../../../2014/01/sunlit_maps.html">about why here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/"><strong>FogBugz</strong></a>: In the past I’ve build my own bug tracker, used Jira, Redmine, GitHub issues, and others I’m forgetting. They all have problems so for Riverfold I keep it simple with hosted FogBugz. To complement this I use OmniFocus for non-bug tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/"><strong>Zendesk</strong></a>: For too long I was just using Apple’s Mail.app to handle support email. Now support email goes to Zendesk, where I can better track and reply to it. The downside is I’ve had a couple cases of people not seeing the replies, possibly because the HTML email is more often flagged as spam. Need to investigate whether I can switch it to plaintext, but otherwise I’m happy.</p>
<p><a href="http://keen.io/"><strong>Keen.io</strong></a>: I was inspired to try this after reading <a href="http://carpeaqua.com/2014/04/08/data-analytics-that-matter/">Justin’s post on analytics</a>. I’m experimenting with it to get better insight into how people are using my apps. So far so good.</p>
<p><a href="https://tapstream.com/"><strong>Tapstream</strong></a>: Just started using this to help track Twitter ads and other links, to see what marketing actually converts to App Store sales. The web app is good, they responded to a support question the same day, and I love that the SDK is just a handful of .m files that can be dropped into an iOS project.</p>
<p>And that’s it. I may have left a few things out (like consumer-focused apps Dropbox, App.net, and Twitter), but these certainly cover the major services I use now. In the old days it was common to just have one server that did everything. Now there are so many specialized services. While it seems like a lot to manage, each one does a much better job than I could do with a home-grown solution.</p>

			<p>I was talking to friends this week about app advertising, and it inspired me to try Twitter ads. Otherwise known as “promoted tweets”, these ads are actual tweets that show up in search results and timelines, even if the user isn’t following your account. <a href="../../../2014/04/tweet_library_25.html">Tweet Library 2.5</a> seemed like the perfect time to try this.</p>
<p>I set a max of $5 a day and included several related Twitter accounts to help the ads find a more narrow audience of people who might want to buy Tweet Library. Here are the results after 24 hours:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2014/promoted_tweets_dashboard.png" width="600" height="367" alt="Promoted tweets dashboard" border="0" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t have an easy way to track this all the way to actual App Store sales. Assuming a 5% conversion on App Store visits, I likely lost a little money. The extra 1800 impressions is nice though, to raise awareness about the app. I’m going to let it run for a week.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://www.coreint.org/2014/02/episode-124-flappy-bird-on-steroids/">On this week’s Core Intuition</a>, we talked a lot about Flappy Bird (and also Threes, and a few other things). One of the points I tried to make is that some of the negativity pointed toward the developer was totally uncalled for. Marco Arment says it well <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/02/12/why-indie-developers-go-insane">in his post on this topic</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Flappy Bird’s success was hilarious, but it also appears to be completely earned. I’ve read the posts suggesting he cheated at the ranks or reviews, but I haven’t seen any that supported those claims enough.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I read Marco’s full post, and re-listened to what Daniel and I said on the podcast, I do wonder if developer Dong Nguyen had been so overwhelmed by the success that the line blurred for him between the death threats and the joke “this ruined my life” app reviews. You’d have to have a pretty thick skin to not let it get to you, even if I hope that most users had a good sense of humor about the whole thing. It’s true that the game is crazy addicting, but unlike some games — the worst of which are driven by consumable in-app purchases, gimmickly rigged to get users to feed money into the game — Flappy Bird is addicting in kind of the best way, because it’s something we’re all playing and can laugh about together.</p>
<p>And Nguyen cares about more than just money. He’s demonstrated an empathy for customers that seems to be lacking in many corners of the App Store. Where some developers said he was leaving money on the table by not having <em>more</em> ads, and other developers were quick to rush in with rip-offs of his app, Ngugen wasn’t afraid to admit it was out of control and pull the app from the store. Do you think any of the other developers who renamed their app to include the word “flappy” would have pulled their app? Not a chance.</p>
<p>I hope Nguyen can bounce back from this and ship more games. With so much attention now, it’ll be fascinating to see what they look like. Or if he’s stashed away some of that $50k/day and wants to just chill out for a while, that’s fine too.</p>

				<a href="../../../2014/02/ending_the_app.html" rel="bookmark">Ending the App Store top 200</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I was chatting with some developers this week, complaining about <a href="http://www.bluecloudsolutions.com/blog/money-apps-turn-1k-200k-portfolio/">this post on spamming the App Store</a> and wondering if we’d ever have a better App Store, when I finally realized how we get there. The block for me had always been the top 200 lists. We all know that you can game them, buy your way in, and apps that make it in even on their own merits have a huge advantage over everything else, sometimes for months. But I couldn’t conceive of how you could actually <em>get rid of them</em> and if it would make the store better or worse.</p>
<p>The answer is in Beats Music. They have no overall top 200 list! Instead, they have a bunch of people — musicians and writers who deeply care about music — curating playlists. The top 25 playlists in a genre are so buried in the app that I had to search them out just to write this blog post, because they seem to carry no more weight than any other playlist. Much more common are playlists like “our top 20 of 2013”. That’s not a best-selling list; it’s based on real people’s favorites.</p>
<p>There are literally hundreds or maybe thousands of other playlists. Intro playlists for a band, related artists that were influential to a singer you like, playlists for a mood or activity, and more. This extra manual step makes it much easier for an algorithm to surface great music: just look for playlists that contain songs you already like, and chances are good that you’ll discover something new.</p>
<p><a href="../../../2014/02/we_love_music.html">I wrote about Beats Music earlier</a>, how it underscored to me that Apple needs to find the next product category to fall in love with, just like they used to feel about music. Of course we know that Apple <em>already loves apps</em>. Show that by doubling down on featured apps, staff picks, and app playlists.</p>
<p>How would this fix the junk problem in the App Store? Simple. No one in their right mind would ever feature one of these ad-filled, “re-skinned” cheap apps. Great recommendations mean less reliance on search, making scam apps more difficult to find by accident. (This focus is so complete in Beats Music, for the first couple days of using it I didn’t even realize you could search for a specific song or album.)</p>
<p>This idea isn’t new. Here’s <a href="http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/70498658794/solving-the-app-store-discovery-problem-with-app">Jared Sinclair on app playlists</a>, with the twist that they’re based on apps you have installed and use:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “App playlists should be rigorously simple: just a list of apps. Not all the apps ever downloaded, but the apps that a given user currently has installed on their device. The assumption is that if somebody has an app on their device, they probably like it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>That would be great. But seeing Beats Music ship with almost no traditional music charts at all — in an industry that has embraced the top 40 for decades — tells me that the Beats approach would also work for apps. I think you need both an “installed” playlist and many more fully curated playlists to actually replace the top 200 in the App Store.</p>
<p>Apple will need to ramp up their staff to do this, but if a new company like Beats can do it, surely a company as huge as Apple can also try. And they’ll have help from app fans everywhere. Writers are already doing this: see Federico Viticci’s <a href="http://www.macstories.net/roundups/my-must-have-ipad-apps-2013-edition/">must-have iPad apps of 2013</a> (could easily be an app playlist) or all the <a href="http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-photo-editing-app-iphone/">photo apps mentioned on The Sweet Setup</a> (favorite photo apps playlist) or TechHive’s <a href="http://www.techhive.com/article/2091807/use-these-budgeting-apps-for-more-money-fewer-problems.html">5 apps for budgeting</a> (my playlist would’ve added <a href="http://nothirst.com/moneywell/ipad/">MoneyWell</a>).</p>
<p>Apple shouldn’t wait until Thursday to feature a few great apps. Feature apps <em>all the time</em>. They’re on the right track with some of the “best of” sections in the store, and with the “Near Me” feature. Go a little further and it will make all the difference to bubble up great apps, and let the junk in the App Store fade away. For the first time I can imagine the store without a top 200 at all, and it looks amazing.</p>

				<a href="../../../2014/01/launching_as_a.html" rel="bookmark">Launching as a paid app</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://dancounsell.com/articles/paid-paymium-or-freemium">Dan Counsell has a great post about paid vs. freemium pricing</a> in the App Store, suggesting that paid apps are often still the best choice:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Launching as a paid app is still one of the most straightforward and safest ways to enter the App Store. Regardless of what you may have heard or read, the paid app market is not dead. As long as you’re smart with your marketing and price carefully you can make a great return on your initial investment.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m pretty sure we left some money on the table with our <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> launch by making it a free download. We had an audience of folks on App.net looking forward to picking it up, plus curious people who had signed up for our announcement mailing list, and others who would find out about it in <a href="../../../2014/01/press_for.html">the first week of press</a>. Many of these people upgraded to the full version inside the app, but I believe many more would have bought it for a few bucks even if the app ultimately wasn’t for them.</p>
<p>And that’s how the App Store works, right? People are always buying 99-cent apps they don’t need. It seems wrong, coming from a Mac background where you download the demo of an app and then pay a fair price after trying it, but so much of the iOS App Store works on cheap gimmicks and over-the-top marketing. People will buy on the promise of an app alone.</p>
<p>But we made Sunlit free anyway, for two reasons. First, because it requires an App.net account, we didn’t want anyone to buy it and then decide not to sign up for an App.net account, making the app they paid for worthless. It’s been great to see people sign up for App.net just to use the app, but we’re realistic enough to know that not everyone will do that.</p>
<p>Second, and most importantly, we have big plans for the app. Plans that include reaching people who don’t pay for apps often. I want my kids to be using this so that when we go on trips, all our best photos can sync to everyone’s device. I want extended family to use this, so that grandparents can stay in touch with what their children and grandchildren are up to. I want it to start free so that anyone can try it, because you never know who’s going to take the app and use it for something new, for ideas we haven’t even thought of.</p>
<p>Sunlit 1.0 is about laying the groundwork. I don’t want to change the price again, and our eye is on the market 6 months from now, a year from now. I think free with in-app purchase is the right approach for that.</p>

			<p>We’ve been really happy to see the reviews of Sunlit popping up around the web. With a new type of app like this, there’s always the risk that people won’t <em>get</em> it. But that hasn’t been a problem at all. I’ve included some quotes below.</p>
<p>Jon Russell on <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/01/18/sunlit-for-ios-is-a-neat-journaling-app-that-lets-you-easily-curate-and-share-photo-stories/">The Next Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The design is beautifully clean and the app is easy to navigate. [&#8230;] Sunlit is an easy way to curate a collection of images that you actually want to share.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Federico Viticci on <a href="http://www.macstories.net/linked/sunlit/">MacStories</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “You choose some photos that ‘tell a story’ – could be a trip, a family gathering, anything you want to remember – and the app pulls in their metadata for date and location. You can add text comments to jot down memories, import photos from Dropbox if you don’t keep them in the Camera Roll, and even add check-ins manually, from Foursquare, or from Steve Streza’s <a href="http://ohaiapp.net/">Ohai</a> app.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>John Gruber on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/01/22/sunlit">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Sunlit has an interesting collaboration and sync model, based on App.net, and a clever integration of maps. You can publish stories on the web, but most of the features are geared toward private group sharing and collaboration through the app.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thorin Klosowski on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/sunlit-automatically-makes-a-photo-journal-using-app-ne-1503461536">Lifehacker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The app itself is great looking and provides fantastic maps to go along with your photos as well as a place to write down any thoughts you might have.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Charlie Sorrel on <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/262817/sunlit-app-builds-photo-journals-using-dopbox-app-net-and-foursquare/">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Apps like Sunlit make sharing your pictures easy, fun and fast.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to everyone who tried the app and told people about it. Version 1.0.1 was approved this week, and you can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/sunlit/id690924901?mt=8">download it for free</a> and upgrade inside the app. Enjoy!</p>

			<p>We released <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> yesterday and the response has been really great. It’s so amazing to see all the replies on App.net, emails of encouragement, and tweets telling people about the app. I think 1.0 is off to an excellent start. We’ll keep making it better.</p>
<p>I was a little anxious about the release, though. It was a challenging app to build, and it’s different enough from other apps that it’s hard to predict how the market will react. I was also surprised that the same morning we shipped our app, <a href="https://www.storehouse.co/">Storehouse</a> was released. This is a beautiful iPad app from Mark Kawano and his new team. The interactions are extremely polished and it’s getting justifiably good praise and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/16/storehouse-an-apple-vet-tries-to-move-the-needle-on-long-form-visual-communication/">lengthy write-ups from Techcrunch</a> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>(Of course, we think Sunlit is pretty awesome too. I’ll be writing more about what makes it special in future blog posts, especially highlighting how it leverages the App.net API, the <a href="https://github.com/manton/sunlit/blob/master/urls.md">URL schemes support</a>, and why we use <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>.)</p>
<p>At first I was stunned by Storehouse. How could it be that we were both working on a similar idea for the last year, and both apps were finished at the same time? The apps have different UIs, and a different approach, maybe even different goals, but they both create stories, revolve around photos, and publish to the web. I’ve seen a lot of people compare the apps, and I think that’s fair.</p>
<p>To be honest, for a few minutes I was a little bummed out. If I had seen <a href="https://twitter.com/jacksonh/status/423906581516808192">this tweet from Jackson Harper</a> at the time, and not later in the day, I might have been nodding in agreement:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Having a somewhat similar free app from a funded developer launch the same day as you must be a little disappointing.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>That doesn’t really capture it, though, because I’m also really happy for the Storehouse team. I’ve known Mark for years. I’m confident that his app is going to be one of the most impressive apps on so many people’s iPads.</p>
<p>And they have a full-time team. Jon and I are just two guys, working in our spare time to build something — something <a href="../../../2014/01/why_we_built_sunlit.html">we think is new</a>, something <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/01/16/sunlit-is-for-me/">for us to use</a>, but also something ambitious in how big it could be.</p>
<p>It seems like a big coincidence that both apps shipped with a similar set of features, but now I realize why it happened. Sure, it’s funny that the release days were identical, and not a few days or weeks apart. But the general timing shouldn’t be at all surprising, because <em>this is an idea whose time has come</em>. There are photo “album”-type apps popping up all over the App Store, such as Cluster, Albumatic, and Heyday, all of which Apple has featured. Plus there are web-based apps like Exposure and Medium, which was recently updated with great photo support as well.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence; it’s just a good idea. And it’s a huge market: everyone who loves writing and taking photos. That understanding gives me a lot of confidence to double down on our plans for Sunlit 1.1, 1.2, and after. 2014 is going to be an awesome year for sharing stories.</p>

			<p><a href="http://nickbradbury.com/2013/12/20/glassboard-finds-a-home/">Nick Bradbury on selling Glassboard</a> to Second Gear:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “When finding a new owner was first discussed, I was very unsure of the idea. We wouldn’t be just handing over our software to someone else – we’d also be handing over our customers and their data. That was such a concern of mine that I suggested we simply kill the product.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>A few times this year I’ve thought about whether I should sell Tweet Marker, but it usually comes back to a similar concern as what Nick says above. I wouldn’t feel comfortable selling it to most companies that would actually want to acquire it. So I’ve made <a href="../../../2013/07/announcing_the_tweet.html">a change</a> or <a href="http://manton.org/2013/11/tweet_marker.html">two</a>, and we’ll see how 2014 goes.</p>
<p>As for Glassboard, I’m excited to see <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/blog/glassboard-acquired-by-second-gear/">what Justin Williams does with it</a>. We use it for Core Intuition questions and feedback (invite code “coreint”), and I’m sure I’ll be using the 3.0 version around conferences next year.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>If you’ve read my blog posts about Tweet Marker over the years, including <a href="../../../2013/07/announcing_the_tweet.html">this one when introducing a paid plan</a>, you might hear a little indecision on the right path forward. I’ve run it more like a community service and less like a business, and admittedly the window for turning it into a profitable endeavor has slipped away. But I still want to make the service work well and improve it.</p>
<p>After vacationing this week leading up to Thanksgiving, I finally realized I need to remove the support burden of giving out free access. Starting today, Tweet Marker will transition to a paid-only service. To make this easier, I’ve introduced a less expensive $25/month plan for smaller developers. (Previously the only choice was $75/month, which is now the top tier plan with unlimited active users.)</p>
<p>This solves the problem of automating access to the API. Instead of having to manually fulfill API keys so that developers could try out Tweet Marker, which usually meant weeks or months of delay until I could get to it, by signing up online, developers get immediate access to the API without having to wait on me.</p>
<p>In the short term, this change means that new apps must subscribe before using the API. In the long run, all existing apps should also transition to a paid plan. I haven’t set a hard deadline for existing apps yet, but will work with developers over the coming months to do so.</p>
<p>You can learn more at <a href="https://api.tweetmarker.net/developers/">tweetmarker.net/developers/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> To be clear, this post is only for developers. There&#8217;s a <a href="https://api.tweetmarker.net/subscribe">$1/month subscription</a> for end users but it is optional.</p>

			<p><a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2013/11/08/five-years-in-the-app-store/">David Smith wrote last week</a> on the 5-year anniversary of shipping his first iPhone app. I started following David’s work in the middle this story — after he had started the Developing Perspective podcast, but before he created Check the Weather and Feed Wrangler — so it’s especially great to see such a nice, reflective post that fills in the earlier apps. On launching and scaling Feed Wrangler:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “In retrospect, it was one of the toughest challenges and most trying times of my career. The relentless dual-pronged attack of late nights and urgent work made it crushing physically and psychologically. Now that things have settled down, I can look back and be glad that I went through it. The kind of things you learn in that kind of crucible can’t be easily recreated.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I could read these kind of posts every day. Also last week, when Gus Mueller announced that he was selling VoodooPad, I remembered as I was <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2013/11/episode-112-it-wasnt-done-enough/">talking with Daniel on Core Intuition 112</a> that Gus’s similar <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/25.html">blog post from 2005</a> is still interesting and relevant today.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>My account in Watermark right now has 805,182 searchable tweets stored in it — tweets from everyone in my timeline, App.net posts, favorites, and of course my own tweets. When I launched the service, I wasn’t sure how long I’d be able to keep storing these. I initially promised 1-2 months, then upped it to 3 months, and then 6.</p>
<p>Today I’m happy to announce that I have a more formal system in place for storage. The default $4/month plan will officially increase to 1 full year, storing every tweet from anyone in your timeline starting when you sign up. Your own tweets and favorites are kept forever.</p>
<p>If 1 year isn’t long enough, there’s a new unlimited plan for $10/month. Every tweet or App.net post in the system for your account will be kept forever. After a year or two it becomes a really massive and interesting search database, tailored just to your account.</p>
<p>The new tiered plans are live now for new accounts, and I’ll be rolling out a method for switching between plans for current customers soon. You can <a href="http://watermark.io/">learn more about Watermark here</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I’m launching a new <a href="https://api.tweetmarker.net/developers/">paid developer plan for Tweet Marker</a> today. It’s $75/month and includes a new admin dashboard with stats on active users, hits, and more. I’ve also expanded the API to support syncing which direct messages have been read.</p>
<p>Why charge developers now, after keeping the service free for 2 years? In part it’s because of something I learned from publishing the <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> podcast with Daniel Jalkut. Because for the first few years of Core Intuition, Daniel and I had trouble getting episodes out very regularly; there was always something more important to work on. Adding sponsors pushed us to stick to a weekly schedule, and it’s worked out even better than I expected.</p>
<p>I hope the same thing will happen for Tweet Marker. Although I’ve put countless hours into maintaining Tweet Marker (and plenty of money on hosting), I couldn’t justify the effort to create new APIs because it wasn’t a revenue-generating product. Now I can dedicate more time to it, even with a modest level of support from developers.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m sensitive to the difficulty of transitioning from a free to paid product. That’s why I’m doing two things to make it easier for everyone.</p>
<p>First, I won’t be turning off any existing developers’ access to the service. The last thing I’d want is to break third-party Twitter apps currently in use. But I do strongly encourage commercial app developers to subscribe if they have the means to.</p>
<p>Second, I’ve created a referral program for app developers to let their customers know about the <a href="https://api.tweetmarker.net/subscribe">$1/month user subscription</a>. This is a great way for developers to show their support even if they can’t subscribe to the developer plan. But even better, for developers who do subscribe, their account will be credited for each paid user they refer. This can effectively make the new developer plan free or significantly discounted.</p>
<p>This is a big change for Tweet Marker, but an important one to make Tweet Marker strong. I’m excited to keep working on it, so that Twitter apps can work even better together. <a href="https://api.tweetmarker.net/developers/signin">Sign in here</a> to learn more about it.</p>

			<p>Sometimes the usefulness of a product speaks for itself. Other times the difference between success and failure comes down to marketing. Most of us can get better at <a href="../../../2011/06/carousel.html">crafting a story</a> around why our apps are important.</p>
<p>And then, there are the folks who just exude hype. I love <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/109906261250470044944/posts/AqAg1WkHAw4">this quote from Jason Calacanis</a>, talking up his new company Inside.com:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It’s going to be somewhere between a hit and groundbreaking.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, it’s over the top. This style wouldn’t work if I said it. But the certainty — that the product’s success is guaranteed, and now we’re just haggling over how big a success it will be — does make me want to know more about what they’re building.</p>

			<p><a href="http://jury.me/blog/2013/3/30/mvp">Michael Jurewitz wrote a great post</a> last week on minimum viable products:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “As you look at your products and how you make them remember these key points. You don’t need all the features under the sun. You don’t need technical excellence (assuming you also avoid technical debt). You need to solve a worthwhile problem in a delightful, thoughtful, and simple way.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>What he’s saying is it’s okay to be limited, but make that limited part totally polished. Cutting back features doesn’t mean you also cut back on quality. It reminds me of <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Half_Not_Half_Assed.php">the quote from 37signals</a>: “build half a product, not a half-ass product”.</p>
<p>This is good advice that I need to take to heart. I don’t have much problem shipping. But my apps often have some rough edges at 1.0.</p>
<p>Also don’t miss Jurewitz’s great <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2013/04/01/understanding-app-store-pricing/">5-part series on App Store pricing</a>. I’m linking to Michael Tsai’s summary here, since it provides nice quotes and links to each part in the series. I saw the talk that these blog posts were based on twice, at Çingleton and NSConference, and this has to be the best translation of a conference session into blog form I’ve ever seen. Not to be missed.</p>
