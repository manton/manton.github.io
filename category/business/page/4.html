			<p>&#8220;Great post from Garrett Dimon&#8221;:http://garrettdimon.com/post/6724266888/my-biggest-mistake, on his biggest mistake building the bug-tracker Sifter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I got bogged down watching our bottom-line even though we&#8217;ve always been comfortably profitable. I worried about preventing fraud even though the only instance we ever encountered only cost us $200. I constantly worried that Sifter could go down at any moment even though we&#8217;ve had 99.96% uptime since launch. [&#8230;] All of these little things were distracting me from the work that really mattered.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For a small company, focusing on the wrong things will make or break a product. I&#8217;m guilty of the same thing. I sat on &#8220;Tweetmarks&#8221;:http://tweetmarks.net/ for 6 months without launching it because I was worried about how to pay for hosting and how to get developers involved.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&#8217;s no obvious solution <em>until you ship</em>. Eventually it becomes easier to know when to be patient &mdash; to solve a problem right the first time &mdash; and when it&#8217;s needless worrying over something that may or may not even happen. And as 37signals says: &#8220;decisions are temporary&#8221;:http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch06_Done.php anyway.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve been sitting on this post for a while. First the good news: &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ is in the Mac App Store. Overall I was very happy with the response and glad to have a new way for customers to find the app.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve received a bunch of good feedback on &#8220;my blog post about Apple&#8217;s 30% cut&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/01/app_store_30_cut.html. A few people are really upset with Apple, and there are posts in the dev forums about Mac apps that still weren&#8217;t approved for one reason or another weeks after the store launched. Other developers keep quiet, either for fear of rocking the boat or because they are happy with their sales and don&#8217;t see a significant problem.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s most of us who know Apple can do even better. We&#8217;re frustrated when an app (not just our own) is rejected or stuck in review indefinitely, but we just accept that things are a little dysfunctional and cross our fingers that maybe Apple will magically become more transparent.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not going to happen by itself. It&#8217;s not going to happen because the culture of Apple under Steve Jobs is secrecy. Apple is about great products, sure, but they&#8217;re so obsessed with the big reveal that it weakens their communication with developers.</p>
<p>From a &#8220;MacSB mailing list post about WWDC&#8221;:http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/macsb/message/18055 by Dave Howell, written back in February:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Second, Apple employees are no longer allowed to talk about anything. In the past, half of the value of WWDC was talking directly to the folks who wrote the OS frameworks you have questions about. But now the answer to any question is always either &#8216;file a bug&#8217; or &#8216;send an email to devprograms@apple.com.&#8217; They&#8217;re all under a gag order.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The baffling part is that many of the problems in the App Store process are easily solvable. The iTunes Connect team could, for example, make it a priority to answer all email. I don&#8217;t know what the organizational structure is over there, and I&#8217;m sympathetic to what must be a flood of app submissions, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like App Store support gets the same quality treatment that Developer Technical Support does.</p>
<p>Contrast with &#8220;Gus Mueller&#8217;s point on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/ccgus/status/24200147764256768:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you on the 30% + silence issue. With PayPal, they&#8217;ll call me back when I email them with problems or questions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Michael Tsai echoes this&#8221;:http://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/01/09/mac-app-store-unanswered-questions/ on his blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The main value of Apple&#8217;s 30% cut is access to a larger market, but it still doesn&#8217;t look good that companies such as PayPal, eSellerate, and E-junkie charge much less and provide great service. I can e-mail or call those companies and get answers right away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Good support takes extra resources and it costs money. Luckily Apple has both, and that&#8217;s why drawing attention to Apple&#8217;s 30% cut was key to my original argument. Developers are playing by Apple&#8217;s rules and helping to fund the App Store.</p>
<p>Despite all this, I&#8217;m upbeat. In 2011 I want to look for ways that I can help Apple succeed, such as filing bugs. For years I swore off bothering, because it took so long to turn around a fix, if ever, and I had long since worked around a bug and moved on. iOS changes that delay because it improves so significantly every single year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for &#8220;praising Apple when it&#8217;s deserved&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/2011/02/04/ode-to-the-app-review-team, but history shows that Apple improves the App Store when people complain. My posts are negative when it&#8217;s warranted and worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>The App Store is getting better. (I love that the Resolution Center is there even if I hope to never need to use it.) The writing is on the wall that a year from now most apps will be distributed through the Mac App Store, and the savings and independence of direct download sales won&#8217;t be worth the maintenance of two separate forms of distribution for many developers. But if Apple holds all the cards in this relationship, then <em>we must hold Apple</em> to a very high standard.</p>

			<p>Don Draper, from the &#8220;season 1 finale of Mad Men&#8221;:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus (YouTube, skip if you plan to watch the whole series):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus"><img src="../../../images/2011/don_draper.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="Don Draper" style="border: 1px solid gray; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" border="0" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This device isn&#8217;t a spaceship; it&#8217;s a time machine. It goes backwards, forwards. It takes us to a place where we ache to go again. It&#8217;s not called the wheel; it&#8217;s called the carousel. It lets us travel the way a child travels &mdash; around and around, and back home again, to a place where we know we were loved.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When I first saw this a couple years ago I thought of Steve Jobs, the master pitchman in our industry. The delivery is different, more personal here, but it was stunning as part of the full episode. Who doesn&#8217;t want to build products that resonate so well, that go from nice utilities or productivity apps to something our customers fall in love with?</p>
<p>First you build a product that changes things, that is truly useful. Something ambitious. Then find a way to sell it that connects, and underscore why it matters.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know how to do this yet. But I do know that part of it is telling stories. Why did I create &#8220;Tweet Library&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/? To tell stories, to remember events that matter before they&#8217;re lost in the fleeting stream of old tweets. It&#8217;s the kind of nostalgia at the heart of the Mad Men clip.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like this post from Kyle Neath of GitHub&#8221;:http://warpspire.com/posts/idea-businesses/, that it&#8217;s about ideas, not products (via &#8220;Duncan Davidson&#8221;:http://duncandavidson.com/):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People want to be part of ideas. Being part of a company who builds a successful product is cool&#8230; but being part of an idea is a lot more attractive. If you can build a business where both your employees and your customers think they&#8217;re part of an idea, you&#8217;ve created something special.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If you can extract the core idea from a great product, everything that comes next can be matched to the idea, so the product has a clear path for new features. Building a story around it &mdash; something that sticks, and having the resources to tell that story properly &mdash; takes a lot of work. I&#8217;m inspired when I see others do it well, and it&#8217;s an art I hope to make time for.</p>

			<p>On a &#8220;recent Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2011/03/episode-38-the-impression-of-standing-still/, Daniel and I talked about version numbers and the message you send by going to 2.0 or 3.0. The version is as much about marketing as it is about technically tracking the release.</p>
<p>I can think of no better example of this than &#8220;Acorn 3&#8221;:http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/. The app started simply enough &mdash; first as just a new FlySketch, then as a simple image editor, then becoming more advanced with each iteration &mdash; but it has really hit its stride with 3.0. The landmark feature, layer styles, alone warrants the bump to 3.0.</p>
<p>Combine with the overall maturity of the app and you get a blockbuster release. Acorn made the top grossing list and was outselling all other non-Apple software. My Twitter stream lit up with good things about the app.</p>
<p>The version number is a part of that. This isn&#8217;t a 2.5. The 3.0 is saying: this is big news, and anyone who has maybe heard of Acorn but never tried it needs to give this version a shot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m particularly happy for Gus because he&#8217;s earned this success over years. From the archives in 2005, &#8220;Gus&#8217;s post on being an indie&#8221;:http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/25.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Just plan, set realistic goals, meet those goals, diversify, save up, add four cups of patience, and have fun. And most importantly- work your ass off. It&#8217;s not difficult, it&#8217;s just not easy. It takes time and patience and hard work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the first great blog posts about working for yourself writing Mac software.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;John Gruber has a solid summary&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2011/03/dirty_percent of the issues around in-app purchase. Regarding the closed platform:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;iOS isn&#8217;t and never was an open computer system. It&#8217;s a closed, controlled console system &mdash; more akin to Playstation or Wii or Xbox than to Mac OS X or Windows. It is, in Apple&#8217;s view, a privilege to have a native iOS app.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the root of nearly every strength and problem with the App Store. I&#8217;ll never be happy about it. But in-app purchase restrictions are even more complicated than that. It started not just with the controlled environment but the decisions around free apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael Tsai points to this Peter Oppenheimer quote&#8221;:http://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/02/24/app-store-revenue-stream/ from late February that Apple runs the App Store at &#8220;just a little over breakeven&#8221;. I&#8217;ve argued that Apple&#8217;s 30% tax is about growing that to significant profit at the expense of developers, but in the back of my head I&#8217;ve also been concerned that maybe it&#8217;s just to keep the App Store from falling into the red. Maybe they are really struggling under the weight of what they created, and long app review times and lack of focus around the Mac App Store launch are just symptoms of that.</p>
<p>If this is true, then I&#8217;m more sympathetic to Apple&#8217;s predicament. They aren&#8217;t being greedy; they&#8217;re just trying not to lose money. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they didn&#8217;t make a mistake.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, announcing the App Store in March 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You know what price a lot of developers are going to pick? Free, right? So when a developer wants to distribute their app for free, there is no charge for free apps. At all. There&#8217;s no charge to the user, and there&#8217;s no charge to the developer. We&#8217;re going to pay for everything to get those apps out there for free. The developer and us have the same exact interest, which is to get as many apps out in front of as many iPhone users as possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I remember being surprised when I heard this. We take for granted now that much of the App Store&#8217;s success is because of free apps, but I&#8217;m not sure it had to be that way. The iTunes Music Store launched with a full paid catalog of music. Many of the hits in the App Store, like Angry Birds and Doodle Jump, have never been free.</p>
<p>But watching Steve Jobs from 2008, you can tell Apple was worried that what happened to the Mac (lack of third-party apps and games) might happen to the iPhone as well, so they gambled the profitability of the App Store away to encourage as many apps as possible. That was their choice.</p>
<p>Again, from Steve Jobs: &#8220;We keep 30% to pay for running the App Store.&#8221; Not a profit center. Not a business. Just to pay for running the store, so that the user experience for app discovery on the iPhone is second to none.</p>
<p>Today, we know that Apple has never planned well for free apps. You don&#8217;t need to look much further than their &#8220;reversal of allowing in-app purchase in free apps&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/143339/2009/10/appstorepurchasing.html to see that they are making this stuff up as they go along.</p>
<p>When Steve Jobs said it, offering free apps for so little seemed almost foolish, like Apple was compensating for the high 30% by giving <em>too</em> good a deal to free apps. Why not charge some hosting fee? Or why not give up exclusive distribution and let free apps be installed directly by the user without forcing everything through the App Store? Unlimited bandwidth, promotion in the store, and everything else just for the $99 dev program fee was a pretty good deal.</p>
<p>And now I wonder if Apple hasn&#8217;t been backpedaling ever since, trying to make up for that mistake: free apps are a burden. iAd was the first correction, because a share of revenue from free apps was going to Google instead of Apple. In-app purchase is the next correction, because real value can be delivered in a free app with transactions handled elsewhere.</p>
<p>Apple can&#8217;t accept a future in which too many apps are technically free &mdash; something that has already happened on Android &mdash; unless they are also taking a cut when money changes hands outside of app download.</p>
<p>&#8220;Matt Drance clearly spotted the loophole&#8221;:http://www.appleoutsider.com/2011/02/22/omgiapbbq/ that forces Apple to be so strict with in-app rules:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;30% to Apple across the board &mdash; app sales, IAP, and now subscriptions &mdash; is consistent, clear, and uncheatable. That cheating bit is significant: a 10% commission for subscriptions, for example, would see developers adopting the subscription system en masse so they could keep more money. Apps that were once $2.99 would suddenly be asking for installments like late-night infomercials.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple is trapped by their original decision to shoulder the cost of free apps. They encouraged free apps and now they&#8217;ve got one band-aid on top of another &mdash; advertisements, in-app purchase, subscriptions &mdash; all trying to make free apps work for the App Store bottom line. These changes make developers nervous because all the power lies with Apple.</p>
<p>Free apps and the problem of exclusive distribution are linked. Get rid of free apps, and the store can support itself naturally. Get rid of exclusive distribution, and Apple can be more creative about charging developers who do want to participate in the App Store. If Amazon isn&#8217;t happy with Apple&#8217;s terms, users can install the Kindle app outside the store and it doesn&#8217;t cost Apple anything to maintain.</p>
<p>Apple, want to charge 30%? Go for it. Want to make the submission rules more strict? Fine. Want to adjust how you run the App Store to reflect what&#8217;s happening in the market? No problem. Just give developers an out. We are going to be back here year after year with the latest controversy until exclusive app distribution is fixed.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The Mac App Store launched! Like many developers I spent the day taking it out for a spin, thinking about whether this changes everything, and trying to ignore the fact that my app Clipstart isn&#8217;t in the store on day 1 even though &#8220;I submitted to Apple 7 weeks ago&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/misc/clipstart_mas_history.png.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s talk about Apple&#8217;s 30% cut, because it&#8217;s been on my mind now that I have a real app in the iPad App Store. It&#8217;s easy to keep these discussions too vague to be meaningful &mdash; 2.9% + $0.30 for PayPal, 8.9% for FastSpring, 30% for Apple, who cares? &mdash; so it&#8217;s more illustrative to work with real numbers.</p>
<p>The massively-popular Camera+ from Tap Tap Tap &#8220;sold 78,000 copies on Christmas day&#8221;:http://www.macrumors.com/2010/12/28/camera-reaches-over-78000-sales-on-christmas-day-alone/, but no one else I know sees numbers like that. My own $10 Tweet Library fell a little short of 1000 copies in its first launch month&#8230; and unfortunately continued to drop since, but let&#8217;s use that to keep the math simple. Selling direct via PayPal would be $590 in fees. To Apple? About $3000.</p>
<p>Apple provides a unique service and it&#8217;s their right to charge whatever they want. Developers can choose to pay it or restrict development to more open platforms. I&#8217;m inclined to think the 30% is high but not unreasonable for everything Apple hopes to provide.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s where everything breaks down: for $3000 I expect someone at Apple to <em>tell me what the $%!# is going on</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just review times, or emails that go into the void, unanswered for days or weeks or ever. It&#8217;s that Apple isn&#8217;t able to communicate about the fundamental issues that will make or break businesses.</p>
<p>&bull; When is the Mac App Store launching? <em>No word</em> from Apple for months, and a press release went to news sites before developers got a heads-up.</p>
<p>&bull; Why has my Mac app been in review for over a month, right up to the very day before the Mac App Store launches? <em>No answer</em>, and nothing to do but wait.</p>
<p>&bull; Where was a beta version of the Mac App Store so that we could understand how it interacted with existing apps before it was too late? <em>Nowhere</em>.</p>
<p>&bull; Why didn&#8217;t we receive more &#8220;guidance on bundle IDs&#8221;:http://openradar.appspot.com/8838369, version numbers, and app naming, obvious questions that only Apple knew the answer to? <em>No clue</em>.</p>
<p>&bull; When will there be promo codes for the Mac App Store to give to the press or help transition customers to the store? <em>No idea</em>, might be never.</p>
<p>A year and a half ago &#8220;Craig Hockenberry wrote about paying extra&#8221;:http://furbo.org/2009/07/10/year-two/ for fast approvals and a better communication channel. It reflected in words how frustrated everyone was over long app review times. At the time, &#8220;I answered&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/07/999_hope.html that quality customer service from Apple is something all developers deserve, not just those with cash to burn.</p>
<p>But clearly it&#8217;s even worse than that. Apple isn&#8217;t currently capable of significantly improving how the App Store works for any price! The App Store does get better, but it does so at Apple&#8217;s own pace.</p>
<p>There are many great people at Apple. Individually I know they are passionate about making good products and helping developers succeed, but collectively it seems like no one person is running the show. The developer-facing side of the company needs to have the freedom to become more transparent, to work closely with the iTunes Connect support team when developers need an answer. Apple&#8217;s secrecy cripples their ability to have a positive relationship with developers.</p>
<p>So do I think the 30% cut is too much? No, not for a straight answer. That would be priceless.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Two new bundles were announced this week: &#8220;The Indie Mac Gift Pack&#8221;:https://indiemacgiftpack.com/ (6 great Mac apps for $60) and the &#8220;Fusion Ads Holiday Bundle&#8221;:https://fusionads.net/bundle/ (an assortment of web design-related apps, icons, and more for $79). I love apps in both of these bundles and recommend you check them out, buy what you need, or gift them to a friend. There&#8217;s a fear among many developers that a bundle can cheapen the healthy Mac software market, but both these bundles avoid that with a higher price and the feel of being put together carefully.</p>
<p>As a comparison, here&#8217;s a &#8220;Macworld article on holiday bundles from 2009&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/145005/2009/12/holiday_bundles.html. That collection seems kind of random despite several good apps in the list.</p>
<p>And sales for the Indie Mac Gift Pack are split evenly to the developers, so we know it&#8217;ll be a nice revenue boost for them during the holidays. From the FAQ:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey&#8230; you&#8217;re ripping these developers off, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;No&#8230; we ARE these developers. Our six small companies decided to band together and do a promotion, to see if it works for us. We&#8217;re splitting all the proceeds evenly. There&#8217;s no middleman here.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve never participated in a bundle, but after some of the &#8220;MacHeist controversy&#8221;:http://homepage.mac.com/simx/technonova/reports/from_the_mouths_of_developers.html I developed a set of rules that I run Riverfold promotions on. These are the easy things that I can always say &#8220;yes&#8221; to without much thought:</p>
<p><em>Coupons are great.</em> My coupons rarely expire and I don&#8217;t care if sites like &#8220;retailmenot.com&#8221;:http://www.retailmenot.com/ keep a list of them. Saving a few bucks might be the difference between someone buying my software and not.</p>
<p><em>Giving out software to bloggers is great.</em> Inspired by &#8220;Wil Shipley&#8217;s C4 talk&#8221;:http://www.viddler.com/explore/rentzsch/videos/4/, I&#8217;ve &#8220;blogged about this&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2008/04/wii_transfer_serial.html. Apple employees get free licenses too.</p>
<p><em>Small promotions are great.</em> I freely give out copies to small sites that want to give away licenses of my software to encourage people to post comments. I think readers interpret these (correctly) as software developers doing something generous for a small site, instead of the gut reaction when you see software listed on MacZot or MacUpdate Promo (&#8220;are sales so bad they had to sell their software for half price?&#8221;).</p>
<p><em>Charity is great</em>. I loved being a part of &#8220;Indie+Relief&#8221;:http://www.indierelief.com/, the Pan-Mass Challenge auctions, and other bundles that go directly to a cause. Just like smaller promotions, these are good for users (deals on software), good for developers (helps with marketing), good for charity (donated money), and good for the software market (these aren&#8217;t developers who are making a sacrifice because their sales aren&#8217;t doing well &mdash; it&#8217;s charity).</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve seen a bundle like the &#8220;Indie Mac Gift Pack&#8221;:https://indiemacgiftpack.com/, I think I can more clearly judge a unique bundle opportunity when it comes along. Does it minimize the middleman? Does it respect the individual apps as peers? Does it use the total bundle price to underscore the value of software rather than cheapen it? Then it&#8217;s probably a good deal for everyone.</p>

			<p>In an &#8220;interview with Kevin Hoctor on episode 5 of the iDeveloper Live podcast&#8221;:http://ideveloper.tv/shows, Scotty referenced my comment from Core Intuition that customers are so used to terrible support that they don&#8217;t mind a few days or even a week delay. I thought this was maybe taken out of context a little since we were talking about vacations, so I went back to listen to what I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most people are thrilled to get a response in a few days, maybe a week they&#8217;re still cool with it. They are used to sending support email to companies and not getting a response any time soon or maybe not at all in some cases.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course I didn&#8217;t mean I strive for week delays before a customer gets a response, but looking back I think Scotty&#8217;s interpretation was right: in a way this was a confession that I&#8217;ve fallen down when it comes to support. My response times for Tweet Library questions are still very good (usually same day), but it&#8217;s dragging for my other products. Even when I&#8217;m quick to respond to an initial email, difficult follow-up questions often won&#8217;t see an answer for some time. I&#8217;m just not as responsive as I was when I wrote &#8220;this blog post about good support in 2007&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/customer.html.</p>
<p>The worst part are the emails that fall through the cracks. They are on their 2nd or 3rd response to a problem that I don&#8217;t understand, or they&#8217;re waiting on a solution that isn&#8217;t ready, and months go by before I can pick up the thread again. I hate this.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to use this opportunity to get back to where I should be: less than 24-hour response in all cases, for all products. I&#8217;m adding a &#8220;stats section to my support page&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/support/ to keep me in check, and I&#8217;ve seeded it with response times for the most recent support questions via email and forums. This will also give customers an idea of what to expect without an explicit promise from me.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;Marco Arment wrote an interesting piece&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/1432156914 on the Mac App Store shortly after it was announced. I was nodding my head in agreement for much of it, until I got to this part:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And if the Mac App Store is only populated by a subset of today&#8217;s Mac software, a few key points (such as &#8216;Inexpensive&#8217;) still won&#8217;t be true. This is why I believe that the Mac App Store will be dominated by (and become known for) apps that don&#8217;t exist on the Mac today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He makes great points, and I think his assumptions about Apple&#8217;s rules are correct. But newcomers dominating the store? And $1 apps as the second most popular price point on the Mac? I&#8217;m not convinced.</p>
<p>Many iPhone app hits lend themselves to a mobile environment, but the Mac is different because <em>people usually buy computers to get work done</em>. You don&#8217;t have your MacBook Pro with you while you&#8217;re waiting in line at the grocery store. You don&#8217;t have it at a party when your friend tells you about the latest game. You don&#8217;t hand your computer to your kids when they&#8217;re bored in the car and want to play Angry Birds.</p>
<p>If $1 apps will be so common on the Mac App Store, why aren&#8217;t they common on the iPad? In the iPad top 10 right now there are only two 99-cent apps. Prices around $2.99 or $4.99 are much more common, and there are plenty of $10 apps as well in the top paid and especially top grossing lists. The iPad app making the most money right now is a $20 music app called &#8220;djay&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think $10-$20 will be pretty common on the Mac App Store, but not $1, and not even $2 or $3. Something that&#8217;s priced so cheap sends a clear message on the Mac: this app is useless and should have been free.</p>
<p>As I said recently on &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/, I absolutely wish all the best of luck to iOS developers and designers moving to the Mac. I had a great time hanging out with a mostly iOS group at 360iDev last month; these guys are ambitious and smart and bring innovation to the platform because they don&#8217;t have the baggage that the rest of us have. 2011 will be a fantastic year for new Mac software and for indie developers!</p>
<p>But take a good look at some of your favorite apps for iPhone and iPad and you&#8217;ll see that for the most part they lack the depth to compete with established Mac software. The workhorses on your Mac &mdash; text editors, image editors, file transfer apps, version control clients, web site tools &mdash; won&#8217;t be knocked off by new competition easily.</p>
<p>Maybe 10.7 Lion will be a revolution, but when the Mac App Store first launches on 10.6 it&#8217;s going to contain familiar software at familiar prices.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Before I released &#8220;Tweet Library&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/, I talked to everyone who would listen about the price. Several people suggested I go with a free app, but use in-app purchase to upgrade to the full version. Two apps that handle this well include &#8220;Twitterrific&#8221;:http://twitterrific.com/ and &#8220;SimpleNote&#8221;:http://simplenoteapp.com/. Countless games also take this approach.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the closest thing the App Store has to demos, but it comes at a cost: anyone can leave a 1-star &#8220;too expensive&#8221; review of your app without even upgrading to the full version. At that point they are not even rating the app they downloaded (a free, limited version that probably works just fine); they are simply commenting on a portion of the app they didn&#8217;t want to buy.</p>
<p>There are two ways to give me feedback about Tweet Library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email support, post to Twitter, or write on your blog about the software. This is free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave a review in the App Store. This is $9.99.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m very comfortable with this model. The quality of feedback I get in email is extremely high, whether the customer has bought the app or not, and the App Store reviews aren&#8217;t cluttered with pricing rants.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>If you purchased, tweeted, blogged about, rated, or mentioned <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> thank you. I&#8217;ve been very happy to see how well it is being received. I built this app because I wanted to do more with Twitter, but I didn&#8217;t really know until it was released if anyone else would care.</p>
<p>The truth is, I released it a tiny bit too early &mdash; there are a few annoying bugs that I&#8217;ll need to fix soon for 1.0.1 &mdash; but it was a long development cycle, and faced with getting burned out on a project the only thing I know how to do is ship it. Then I can use the reaction from real customers to tell me if I&#8217;m on the right track and where to go next.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already blogged about the pricing and <a href="../../../2010/09/next_generation.html">viability of third-party Twitter apps</a>, though I hadn&#8217;t officially announced the app yet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When Twitter for iPad shipped it jumped to the number 1 spot in free apps, but maybe you don&#8217;t have to compete directly with that. Maybe if you hold your ground somewhere in the top paid list, that&#8217;s enough to find an audience.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Tweet Library has only been out for 3 full days, and I don&#8217;t want to jinx it, but so far this theory is holding. The app went to #2 for top grossing iPad apps in social networking in the first day. I didn&#8217;t expect that, but at $10 I can see how it might happen. Then it also climbed to #2 in top paid iPad apps in the same category, and stayed there for a couple days before dropping to #3 as I write this. The only other Twitter apps in any of the top 10 lists for iPad are Twitter&#8217;s official app and TweetDeck, both free.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that because it kind of blows my mind a little: Tweet Library has been the best-selling iPad Twitter app since it was released.</p>
<p>How did I successfully ship an app in a crowded market at literally 2x the price of any other app? Two things:</p>
<p><em>Refuse to compete on price.</em> I felt so strongly about this that I was willing to launch and fail. If the App Store couldn&#8217;t support $10 Twitter apps, then I would bow out. I saw in <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/10/06/tweet-library-for-ipad-makes-twitter-useful/">a comment on TUAW</a> that someone would wait until the price lowered, but I hope to avoid the pricing gimmicks common to the App Store. There&#8217;s no intro price for Tweet Library, and the price is not going to change. I believe consistency is the best long-term plan for app pricing.</p>
<p><em>Market the app as something new first and yet another Twitter app second.</em> I believe the key to selling Tweet Library is to focus the marketing around what makes it special: archiving tweets, curating tweets, filtering tweets. Yes, you can also post to Twitter and see mentions or reply to DMs, but that is just the price to get in the door. Tweet Library doesn&#8217;t do those common tasks perfectly yet, but customers seem willing to cut me some slack because of all the other unique features that the app offers.</p>
<p>So, up next I&#8217;m going to fix bugs, and I&#8217;m going to add features, and I&#8217;m going to listen to customers. I&#8217;m sure it will soon drop out of the top 10 and other Twitter apps will take its place, but I feel like the launch was strong enough to prove that I&#8217;ve got something. I intend to carve out a little niche in the Twitter market and execute on it.</p>

			<p>Jason Fried, &#8220;from a recent interview&#8221;:http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2494-the-big-think-interview-take-two: &#8220;Interruption and collaboration are different things.&#8221; If you haven&#8217;t listened to a Jason Fried talk recently, this one covers a lot of good stuff.</p>
<p>I also like &#8220;episode 19 of their podcast&#8221;:http://37signals.com/podcast/#episode19, which is edited from a live recording of a planning session for Rework. My first impression of Rework was that it was <em>too</em> finely edited &mdash; that to get to the essence they threw away too much material. I wanted to hear more case studies from their business, approaches that worked or didn&#8217;t, and lessons learned.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve flipped through the book again, a few months later, and it holds up. I don&#8217;t know if it was intentional or not, but the lack of filler text gives it a certain timelessness. Each chapter is one core argument, and whether that topic resonates with the reader or not depends entirely on what you and I bring to it from our own job experiences.</p>

			<p>The sort of odd &#8220;best of both worlds&#8221; balance in my different projects at &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ and as a solo shop is that I love working with a team, and I also love working alone. I mean really alone, doing the planning and design and coding and marketing. I&#8217;ve resisted farming out any piece of my apps at &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ (except the application icon) so that I can have complete control. It&#8217;s brutally hard sometimes, but it&#8217;s mine.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re working by yourself and add another person to the project, a funny thing happens: you become a manager. Before, you could spend 100% of your time on the work. Now you can allocate 50-75%, because you&#8217;re getting the new programmer up to speed, answering questions, and setting priorities. If you&#8217;re lucky (and I usually am), the person you added is contributing so much that it easily makes up for your loss in productivity, and then some.</p>
<p>The trade-off is worth it. Exchange the previous low communication overhead for extra coding man-hours.</p>
<p>You can build something great with a team, something that would be impossible alone, if you surround yourself with people who are better at your job than you are. I love that first moment when a team doubles in size from 1 to 2, or 2 to 4.</p>
<p>But after the initial frenzy of coding and emails and new features, I usually get burned out again. The project doesn&#8217;t strictly need me anymore, and I&#8217;m ready to get back to starting an app from scratch, when the scope is so small that the whole thing still fits in my head.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m fascinated with App Store pricing. There&#8217;s just so much interesting stuff going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>99-cent apps and the race to the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users expecting apps to be cheaper because the device is smaller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The high-end successes like OmniGraffle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sales and pricing gimmicks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether apps can compete outside of the top 100.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So when 37signals launched their first iPad app &mdash; Draft, for sketching mockups and quickly uploading them to Campfire &mdash; the first thing I wondered was: &#8220;how much?&#8221; The comments on their &#8220;launch blog post&#8221;:http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2420-launch-draft-for-ipad are a hilarious and sad mix of the usual cheapskates balanced with 37signals defenders. But the most amusing part is that at only $10, Draft is a bargain compared to Campfire itself, which has an entry-level paid plan of nearly $150/year.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m a big Campfire fan, actually. The best iPhone client for Campfire, Ember, has a permanent spot on &#8220;my home screen&#8221;:http://www.firstand20.com/homescreens/manton-reece/.)</p>
<p>My first indie iPad app, a 3-4 week project that has stretched to 3-4 months, will also be $10. At that price it will be twice as expensive as its competition. I&#8217;m pricing it that way for three main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s worth the price of two trips to Starbucks, because it takes the category in a new direction with features no one else is doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s designed for people who are serious about this stuff, not an impulse buy, not for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s a standalone app but includes an optional web complement, offered for free, but which will incur &#8220;real hosting costs&#8221;:http://www.heroku.com/.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Daniel Jalkut and I talked about this a bit on &#8220;Core Intuition 28&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2010/04/episode-28-the-ipad-super-episode/ &mdash; that it might be okay to overcharge a little for 1.0 rather than raise the price later, and that it should be possible to build a business on the iPad the same way many developers have on the Mac: not by looking for the big overnight hit but by steadily selling some number of copies every day and letting it spread by word of mouth.</p>
<p>Marco Arment wrote about this as &#8220;App Store B&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/208454730 in October last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;More of their customers notice and demand great design and polish. More sales come from people who have heard of your product first and seek it out by name. Many of these apps are priced above $0.99. These are unlikely to have giant bursts of sales, and hardly any will come close to matching the revenue of the high-profile success stories, but they have a much greater chance of building sustained, long-term income.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re three months into the iPad, just passed 3 million devices sold, and not every app has dropped to near-free. I think $10 iPad apps in particular are going to remain pretty common.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Three years ago &#8220;I wrote the following&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/customer.html about customer support:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most people who buy Mac software from independent developers know that it&#8217;s only 1-5 people behind the company. We can&#8217;t compete with the Microsofts and Adobes of the world on application size, but we can compete on quality customer service. _Being small is a competitive advantage_.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems reasonable, but the fact is that many small companies are struggling to keep up with the support load. &#8220;Jesse Grosjean recently downgraded&#8221;:http://blog.hogbaysoftware.com/post/468160055/support-expectations his support expectations for customers. From the official site:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll answer basic questions and license key/order issues as fast as I can. I also appreciate larger questions and feature suggestions, but I&#8217;m finding that I no longer have time to answer them all as I used to (mostly). I promise to read and consider everything, but you may not get an individual response.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of Jesse&#8217;s TaskPaper and his minimalist approach to Mac development. He is very honest with customers and encourages participation starting with early beta versions.</p>
<p>But it can be damaging to set support expectations too low. Here&#8217;s what a support page says about support in &#8220;Pastebot&#8221;:http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot/, another one of my favorite iPhone apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We try our best to answer every support question. But please make sure your question hasn&#8217;t already been answered in our FAQ. If you email us with an issue that has already been explained in the FAQs, we may skip the email.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This seems slightly backwards to me. The questions in the FAQ are the <em>easiest</em> to answer! I respond to those immediately. It&#8217;s the hard questions for which I don&#8217;t have a good answer yet that usually take the longest time or are more likely to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Is the weight of support for iPhone developers just too much? TaskPaper and Pastebot are both very popular. I guess we can all hope to be successful enough that we find out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I had a question for &#8220;Beanstalk&#8221;:http://beanstalkapp.com/ yesterday and received a response in just 19 minutes and an additional follow-up response in under 10 minutes. I like to show off impressive companies, so I tweeted how fast their response was. &#8220;Their answer&#8221;:http://twitter.com/Beanstalkapp/status/11270045214 to my tweet? &#8220;We&#8217;re usually faster.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yep, that&#8217;s the right attitude. Set your standards high.</p>

<p>This is the kind of thing I&#8217;ll try to remember when I look at the apps I&#8217;ve started but never shipped, even as they sit very close to finished for a year or more. Almost everyone I know who has successful products also has experiments and failed prototypes and unfinished work you&#8217;ve never heard of. That&#8217;s okay as long as it doesn&#8217;t stop you from shipping the best and making those real.</p>

			<p>I was chatting with some developers the other night about giving away software to Apple employees. If you&#8217;re not familiar with the practice, it&#8217;s fairly common to give free or discounted licenses to Apple employees as a gesture of goodwill to the people responsible for making our platform, and in the hope that they will spread the word to friends and customers in the Apple Stores. (If you&#8217;re a developer and want to set this up, &#8220;check out Dan Wood&#8217;s overview&#8221;:http://www.karelia.com/mac_indie_marketing/give_your_app_to_apple_empl.html.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve given away over 1000 licenses for &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ and &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ to Apple employees since I started doing it a few months ago. I didn&#8217;t expect this number to be so high, but I guess it makes sense. Apple folks are getting a link from their internal site directly to my special registration page, and many of them probably request a serial number just in case they need it later.</p>
<p>The question I have isn&#8217;t whether it&#8217;s worth it; it only took a few hours to set up, and even if it just makes a handful of Apple employees happy then that&#8217;s a success. But I was curious about the greater impact of giving away my software. Is the $0 investment in a pile of other free licenses enough to engage someone to, for example, take the time to set up Clipstart and move a collection of videos into it, let alone recommend it to others? (See also: &#8220;Worthless apps&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/12/worthless_apps.html.)</p>
<p>To find out more, I sent a special newsletter to all the @apple.com addresses in my registration database, asking if they used the software, how they liked it, and whether they&#8217;d recommend it to others or not. And I included in &#8220;the short survey&#8221;:http://riverfold.wufoo.com/forms/riverfold-survey-for-apple-2010/ a place for general feedback, and a choice about upcoming features.</p>
<p>Some developers I talked with were concerned about a potential backlash. Although I send a newsletter to my customers once or twice a year, it&#8217;s debatable whether some of the people I was including had implicitly signed up by purchasing (with a 100% discount!) or whether I had crossed a line. The last thing I want to do is upset any of my customers, and I provide the same level of support to everyone whether they&#8217;ve paid full price, received a free license, or just tried the demo.</p>
<p>In the end I decided it was harmless. The email was short, plain text, and had an obvious one-click unsubscribe link. One of the things I like about using &#8220;Campaign Monitor&#8221;:http://www.campaignmonitor.com/ is that once someone unsubscribes, any new mailings are automatically scrubbed against the unsubscribers list. Even if I accidentally add the customer again in the future they won&#8217;t receive an email. So far, 2.2% of recipients have unsubscribed.</p>
<p>As for the survey results, here are a few graphs. Not many people filled out the survey (like unsubscribes, just a couple percent, though they&#8217;re still trickling in after 2 days), but the other feedback I received in the comments and feature questions was very helpful. 100% of users said they had mentioned the product to someone else.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../images/2010/apple_2010_charts.png" alt="Survey charts" title="apple_2010_charts.png" border="0" width="400" height="446" /></div>
<p>Would I do this again? No, not such a narrowly-focused newsletter as this. The quick survey served its purpose, but I am always nervous about wearing out my welcome. I plan to add an explicit newsletter opt-in checkbox to my free license page, and I should do a better job of differentiating free licenses and paying customers in the future. I&#8217;ll send another general newsletter out to all customers (and opt-ins from contests) when I have something major to announce later in the year.</p>

			<p>This story about &#8220;PayPal screwing over a Mac indie business&#8221;:http://blog.apparentsoft.com/business/124/is-paypal-good-for-your-microisv-business-a-short-paypal-horror-story/ should be a real concern to anyone relying on PayPal. These kind of things come up from time to time, often with frozen accounts because too much money was suddenly flowing into or out of an account, but I&#8217;ve always stuck with PayPal because they have low rates and I haven&#8217;t run into any problems. There&#8217;s nothing fancy about the way I sell &#8220;my products&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/, but it works, and I hate to change things that aren&#8217;t broken.</p>
<p>As a user, I&#8217;ve gone from avoiding PayPal to preferring it. I&#8217;m less likely to use a credit card with online shops that I&#8217;ve never heard of before (although more because of the hassle of entering all my information than for any security concerns). It&#8217;s also convenient for me to have small expenses like hosting and software purchases all in one place under my PayPal account.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s time to get serious about this, so I&#8217;ve decided to use &#8220;FastSpring&#8221;:http://www.fastspring.com/ as a backup. I like FastSpring&#8217;s admin interface, testing mode, templates, and focus on customer support. I&#8217;m impressed with the &#8220;Atebits custom store&#8221;:https://sites.fastspring.com/atebits/instant/tweetie-mac hosted on FastSpring, and the &#8220;reasons Justin Williams chose for switching&#8221;:http://carpeaqua.com/2009/11/09/why-i-chose-fastspring/. The fees are a little high for everyday use (8.9% vs. PayPal&#8217;s 3.9%), but it&#8217;s perfect as a secondary payment processor, waiting for me to flip the switch if anything goes wrong with my PayPal account.</p>

			<p>I was reminded by &#8220;Nick Bonatsakis on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/nickbonas that I never wrote about how giving away the iPhone worked out. The short answer is: pretty well! The longer answer follows.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve conducted 3 giveaways for Riverfold Software now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nintendo Wii, back when they were in short supply. You could enter by sending a message to &#8220;@wii&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii or by entering your email address and sharing the link with a friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iPhone 3GS, plus year of Vimeo Plus and Flickr Pro. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll talk about below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Super Mario Bros Wii game. Probably the simplest giveaway, all I asked is that you give me your email address and optionally sign up for my newsletter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases I had two goals: do something fun for potential customers, and give the press an excuse to write about my products. By that metric all the giveaways were successful.</p>
<p>I noticed when originally giving away the Wii that most of the entries were Windows users &mdash; people who couldn&#8217;t even use my application! So for the iPhone giveaway I made a change: you could only enter by downloading the app and choosing a special menu item, which loaded a simple webview with the entry form. Pretty straightforward, and no complaints. The total number of entries was lower, but they were targeted to existing or potential customers.</p>
<p>In additional to sending news about the giveaway to a few contacts who I hoped would pick up the story, I also wrote a formal press release for it, which &#8220;went out through prMac&#8221;:http://prmac.com/release-id-6861.htm. This is so inexpensive that it&#8217;s hard to find fault with it, but I think the main outcome was getting contacted for advertising on sites that I had never heard of before.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is to set up a &#8220;system to track referrers&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2008/09/tracking_sales_referrers.html through to sales, so that you can judge the effectiveness of these giveaway-style marketing efforts. I could tell right away that it paid for itself, but it wasn&#8217;t a significant bump in overall weekly stats. I do believe it helps long-term though.</p>
<p>The final part I took pride in was <em>shipping quickly</em>. Growing up we all had the wind knocked out of our sails by the &#8220;allow 6-8 weeks for delivery&#8221; fine print on cereal box prizes or other mail-in gimmicks. If nothing else, I made an effort to ship the next day if possible, and I paid for express shipping.</p>
<p>Giving away stuff is fun. Until I get sued for not following some obscure rule on contests because I didn&#8217;t hire a lawyer, I&#8217;ll plan for more giveaways in 2010.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I like &#8220;this article on Mobile Orchard about the relationship between price and ratings&#8221;:http://www.mobileorchard.com/app-store-heresies-higher-price-better-ratings-dont-discount-your-app-at-launch/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Customers with some skin in the game carry a psychological pressure to feel that they&#8217;ve been wise in their purchases; they&#8217;ll tend to over emphasize their positive feelings.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This makes sense to me, and the other side of pricing that&#8217;s so important is the message you send. The perceived value of a product is connected to the published price. This is especially true in the App Store, where there&#8217;s no way to try the software before purchasing it. The price sets expectations.</p>
<p>So to take the Mobile Orchard analysis a little further: no one feels guilty judging a free app harshly with a 1-star rating because <em>even the developer thinks the app is literally worthless</em>.</p>
<p>Sure, there are good reasons to have a free app. To complement another paid service or desktop app, as a demo for a game or full version, or to &#8220;make $125,000/month in ad revenue&#8221;:http://fingergaming.com/2009/12/02/paper-toss-developer-earns-125000-in-monthly-ad-revenue/. In fact half the ideas I had for iPhone apps would have been free. But I don&#8217;t think any of that changes the truth of what Mobile Orchard said, that free stuff isn&#8217;t respected as much as something the customer is personally invested in.</p>
