			<p>Seth Godin on an &#8220;exhibit for Tim Burton&#8221;:http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/unrealized-projects.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the guy who&#8217;s responsible for some of the most breathtaking movies of his generation, and the real surprise is this: almost every year over the last thirty, he worked on one or more exciting projects that were never green lighted and produced. _Every year, he spent an enormous amount of time on failed projects._&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of thing I&#8217;ll try to remember when I look at the apps I&#8217;ve started but never shipped, even as they sit very close to finished for a year or more. Almost everyone I know who has successful products also has experiments and failed prototypes and unfinished work you&#8217;ve never heard of. That&#8217;s okay as long as it doesn&#8217;t stop you from shipping the best and making those real.</p>
<p>I have a lot to announce this week. Posts on a new Wii Transfer, the Indie Relief effort, and Macworld all coming up.</p>

			<p>I was chatting with some developers the other night about giving away software to Apple employees. If you&#8217;re not familiar with the practice, it&#8217;s fairly common to give free or discounted licenses to Apple employees as a gesture of goodwill to the people responsible for making our platform, and in the hope that they will spread the word to friends and customers in the Apple Stores. (If you&#8217;re a developer and want to set this up, &#8220;check out Dan Wood&#8217;s overview&#8221;:http://www.karelia.com/mac_indie_marketing/give_your_app_to_apple_empl.html.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve given away over 1000 licenses for &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ and &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ to Apple employees since I started doing it a few months ago. I didn&#8217;t expect this number to be so high, but I guess it makes sense. Apple folks are getting a link from their internal site directly to my special registration page, and many of them probably request a serial number just in case they need it later.</p>
<p>The question I have isn&#8217;t whether it&#8217;s worth it; it only took a few hours to set up, and even if it just makes a handful of Apple employees happy then that&#8217;s a success. But I was curious about the greater impact of giving away my software. Is the $0 investment in a pile of other free licenses enough to engage someone to, for example, take the time to set up Clipstart and move a collection of videos into it, let alone recommend it to others? (See also: &#8220;Worthless apps&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/12/worthless_apps.html.)</p>
<p>To find out more, I sent a special newsletter to all the @apple.com addresses in my registration database, asking if they used the software, how they liked it, and whether they&#8217;d recommend it to others or not. And I included in &#8220;the short survey&#8221;:http://riverfold.wufoo.com/forms/riverfold-survey-for-apple-2010/ a place for general feedback, and a choice about upcoming features.</p>
<p>Some developers I talked with were concerned about a potential backlash. Although I send a newsletter to my customers once or twice a year, it&#8217;s debatable whether some of the people I was including had implicitly signed up by purchasing (with a 100% discount!) or whether I had crossed a line. The last thing I want to do is upset any of my customers, and I provide the same level of support to everyone whether they&#8217;ve paid full price, received a free license, or just tried the demo.</p>
<p>In the end I decided it was harmless. The email was short, plain text, and had an obvious one-click unsubscribe link. One of the things I like about using &#8220;Campaign Monitor&#8221;:http://www.campaignmonitor.com/ is that once someone unsubscribes, any new mailings are automatically scrubbed against the unsubscribers list. Even if I accidentally add the customer again in the future they won&#8217;t receive an email. So far, 2.2% of recipients have unsubscribed.</p>
<p>As for the survey results, here are a few graphs. Not many people filled out the survey (like unsubscribes, just a couple percent, though they&#8217;re still trickling in after 2 days), but the other feedback I received in the comments and feature questions was very helpful. 100% of users said they had mentioned the product to someone else.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../../images/2010/apple_2010_charts.png" alt="Survey charts" title="apple_2010_charts.png" border="0" width="400" height="446" /></div>
<p>Would I do this again? No, not such a narrowly-focused newsletter as this. The quick survey served its purpose, but I am always nervous about wearing out my welcome. I plan to add an explicit newsletter opt-in checkbox to my free license page, and I should do a better job of differentiating free licenses and paying customers in the future. I&#8217;ll send another general newsletter out to all customers (and opt-ins from contests) when I have something major to announce later in the year.</p>

			<p>This story about &#8220;PayPal screwing over a Mac indie business&#8221;:http://blog.apparentsoft.com/business/124/is-paypal-good-for-your-microisv-business-a-short-paypal-horror-story/ should be a real concern to anyone relying on PayPal. These kind of things come up from time to time, often with frozen accounts because too much money was suddenly flowing into or out of an account, but I&#8217;ve always stuck with PayPal because they have low rates and I haven&#8217;t run into any problems. There&#8217;s nothing fancy about the way I sell &#8220;my products&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/, but it works, and I hate to change things that aren&#8217;t broken.</p>
<p>As a user, I&#8217;ve gone from avoiding PayPal to preferring it. I&#8217;m less likely to use a credit card with online shops that I&#8217;ve never heard of before (although more because of the hassle of entering all my information than for any security concerns). It&#8217;s also convenient for me to have small expenses like hosting and software purchases all in one place under my PayPal account.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s time to get serious about this, so I&#8217;ve decided to use &#8220;FastSpring&#8221;:http://www.fastspring.com/ as a backup. I like FastSpring&#8217;s admin interface, testing mode, templates, and focus on customer support. I&#8217;m impressed with the &#8220;Atebits custom store&#8221;:https://sites.fastspring.com/atebits/instant/tweetie-mac hosted on FastSpring, and the &#8220;reasons Justin Williams chose for switching&#8221;:http://carpeaqua.com/2009/11/09/why-i-chose-fastspring/. The fees are a little high for everyday use (8.9% vs. PayPal&#8217;s 3.9%), but it&#8217;s perfect as a secondary payment processor, waiting for me to flip the switch if anything goes wrong with my PayPal account.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I was reminded by &#8220;Nick Bonatsakis on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/nickbonas that I never wrote about how giving away the iPhone worked out. The short answer is: pretty well! The longer answer follows.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve conducted 3 giveaways for Riverfold Software now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nintendo Wii, back when they were in short supply. You could enter by sending a message to &#8220;@wii&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii or by entering your email address and sharing the link with a friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iPhone 3GS, plus year of Vimeo Plus and Flickr Pro. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll talk about below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Super Mario Bros Wii game. Probably the simplest giveaway, all I asked is that you give me your email address and optionally sign up for my newsletter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases I had two goals: do something fun for potential customers, and give the press an excuse to write about my products. By that metric all the giveaways were successful.</p>
<p>I noticed when originally giving away the Wii that most of the entries were Windows users &mdash; people who couldn&#8217;t even use my application! So for the iPhone giveaway I made a change: you could only enter by downloading the app and choosing a special menu item, which loaded a simple webview with the entry form. Pretty straightforward, and no complaints. The total number of entries was lower, but they were targeted to existing or potential customers.</p>
<p>In additional to sending news about the giveaway to a few contacts who I hoped would pick up the story, I also wrote a formal press release for it, which &#8220;went out through prMac&#8221;:http://prmac.com/release-id-6861.htm. This is so inexpensive that it&#8217;s hard to find fault with it, but I think the main outcome was getting contacted for advertising on sites that I had never heard of before.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is to set up a &#8220;system to track referrers&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2008/09/tracking_sales_referrers.html through to sales, so that you can judge the effectiveness of these giveaway-style marketing efforts. I could tell right away that it paid for itself, but it wasn&#8217;t a significant bump in overall weekly stats. I do believe it helps long-term though.</p>
<p>The final part I took pride in was <em>shipping quickly</em>. Growing up we all had the wind knocked out of our sails by the &#8220;allow 6-8 weeks for delivery&#8221; fine print on cereal box prizes or other mail-in gimmicks. If nothing else, I made an effort to ship the next day if possible, and I paid for express shipping.</p>
<p>Giving away stuff is fun. Until I get sued for not following some obscure rule on contests because I didn&#8217;t hire a lawyer, I&#8217;ll plan for more giveaways in 2010.</p>

			<p>I like &#8220;this article on Mobile Orchard about the relationship between price and ratings&#8221;:http://www.mobileorchard.com/app-store-heresies-higher-price-better-ratings-dont-discount-your-app-at-launch/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Customers with some skin in the game carry a psychological pressure to feel that they&#8217;ve been wise in their purchases; they&#8217;ll tend to over emphasize their positive feelings.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This makes sense to me, and the other side of pricing that&#8217;s so important is the message you send. The perceived value of a product is connected to the published price. This is especially true in the App Store, where there&#8217;s no way to try the software before purchasing it. The price sets expectations.</p>
<p>So to take the Mobile Orchard analysis a little further: no one feels guilty judging a free app harshly with a 1-star rating because <em>even the developer thinks the app is literally worthless</em>.</p>
<p>Sure, there are good reasons to have a free app. To complement another paid service or desktop app, as a demo for a game or full version, or to &#8220;make $125,000/month in ad revenue&#8221;:http://fingergaming.com/2009/12/02/paper-toss-developer-earns-125000-in-monthly-ad-revenue/. In fact half the ideas I had for iPhone apps would have been free. But I don&#8217;t think any of that changes the truth of what Mobile Orchard said, that free stuff isn&#8217;t respected as much as something the customer is personally invested in.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Great post by Jason Cohen&#8221;:http://blog.asmartbear.com/blog/put-down-the-compiler-until-you-learn-why-theyre-not-buying.html on why you need feedback about the real reason people aren&#8217;t buying your product:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You need to talk with the people who were interested enough to find your website, read your marketing copy, download your product, and then _give up without even an email_. That&#8217;s the low-hanging fruit; those are the people who are _in your grasp_, who should be buying _today_, but aren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I fall into this trap quite often, of pretending I know what the product needs for sales to finally take off. So I&#8217;ll add all the features I hope customers want, or I&#8217;ll make a small change and see if sales improve. But the truth is that there are so many variables in this system that it&#8217;s difficult to know which change made the difference.</p>
<p>As an example, I decided recently that I was being too generous with the demo limits in &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/, so in the 1.2.1 release I turned them down a little. Instead of letting you tag 30 videos and upload 3 for free, it&#8217;s down to 20 videos and 2 uploads. The idea is to just do a little bit more to encourage users to buy the software when they are first trying it out and like it, rather than waiting a month until they decide to use it again.</p>
<p>Sales have been up the last week, so this worked, right? Maybe not. Clipstart has a review in this month&#8217;s print edition of Macworld, so it&#8217;s possible the sales are up because of that. Or because a couple of my blog posts have been linked more heavily recently. Or for any number of other reasons.</p>
<p>Unless you measure why the product doesn&#8217;t sell, success will be based on luck and intuition, which only go so far. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading Jason&#8217;s next post.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Gus Mueller&#8221;:http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2009/08/setting_the_right_priorities.html, in response to a post from Joel Spolsky:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If no one is buying your app then you&#8217;ve either got a dud and you need to focus on something else, or you need to improve your app so it&#8217;s worth paying for.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I hinted at this in &#8220;my last post about new Clipstart features&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/08/clipstart_12_ships.html. When Clipstart 1.0 launched and sales were lower than I had secretly hoped, the feedback was still so encouraging that it was obvious I had to keep rolling out new versions. Release 1.1, a month later. Release 1.2, which is &#8220;shipping today&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/.</p>
<p>Some products are just easier to sell than others. For Wii Transfer, people enter &#8220;music wii mac&#8221; in Google and then a few minutes later they are clicking the Buy button on my web site. But with Clipstart, even though I believe it to be a superior product, it&#8217;s going to take work and marketing and word-of-mouth and demo coaxing and making it so good that you&#8217;d be nuts to shoot video and not have it installed.</p>

			<p>For the last couple of years, I&#8217;ve been squeezing work out of every free moment I have to build <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart</a> and <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/">Wii Transfer</a>, and every six months or so I&#8217;m just completely burned out and need to take a break. I was in North Carolina for work meetings last week and after coming back I took the opportunity to sleep 10 hours a night for 3 days. I seriously needed rest and to spend some quality time with family away from the computer.</p>
<p>And now I&#8217;m making some coffee and ready to get back to work.</p>
<p>A lot of people ask me how I&#8217;ve been able to dedicate time to side projects when my life is already pretty full with a regular job and kids. The truth is that most of us have small pockets of free time, and it&#8217;s just about how we prioritize and use that time.</p>
<p><a href="http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2008/04/clay_shirky:_gin__television__and_social_surplus.html">Gus Mueller says</a> that the secret to building VoodooPad 1.0 was simple: he didn&#8217;t own a television. Gary Vaynerchuk, in his upcoming book <a href="http://crushitbook.com/">Crush It</a>, puts it this way: &#8220;Someone with less passion and talent and poorer content can totally beat you if they&#8217;re willing to work longer and harder than you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s about setting priorities and pushing yourself. Pretty straightforward. But recently I ran across a forum post on the community site ConceptArt.org that took this even further &mdash; that success comes not just from priorities and working hard but also with real sacrifice. The members of ConceptArt are passionate about improving their art and helping others, and there&#8217;s an obvious pride there that comes from the shared challenge of becoming a better artist.</p>
<p>In a comment on attending a $95 painting workshop, <a href="http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=167390">the first commenter said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I honestly don&#8217;t care if I have to go a week with practically no food to be able to afford it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>There is something in that extreme comment that just nails it. Go without food? We&#8217;re still having trouble with the trivial sacrifice of not watching TV over here!</p>
<p>The advice I&#8217;ll give to myself and to anyone else who needs inspiration on finding time: rewrite that comment for yourself, replacing &#8220;week&#8221;, &#8220;food&#8221;, and &#8220;afford it&#8221; with what your sacrifice is going to be. Examples:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I honestly don&#8217;t care if I have to go for a year without watching TV to be able to build my product.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I honestly don&#8217;t care if I have to go for a week without sleeping more than 5 hours a night to be able to ship on time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I honestly don&#8217;t care if I have to go for a month without reading blogs to be able to focus on my own ideas.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>New projects aren&#8217;t going to magically finish themselves. If we&#8217;ve been tinkering with a project for a year and it seems like it&#8217;s never going to be done, the reality is that it probably <em>cannot be finished without making a scheduling change</em>. Even a tiny sacrifice to open up an extra hour a day might be enough to make it happen.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Yesterday I sent out a newsletter to all my &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ customers. You can see the &#8220;text of the newsletter here&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/newsletter/2009/07.html. I wasn&#8217;t sure how effective this would be, but I immediately got a bunch of responses to the survey, and hopefully more interest in Clipstart too.</p>
<p>I decided against doing any specific tracking for number of views and links clicked, but there was an obvious spike in traffic for a couple hours as people clicked on the links in the email.</p>
<p>The survey results are about what I expected. Most people are buying Wii Transfer to watch movies and listen to music on their TV. I&#8217;ll use this feedback to simplify the user interface around these features, and prune back a feature set that had grown a little too fast for its own good.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a chart of the results so far:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2009/wt3survey.png" alt="Survey chart" border="0" width="524" height="270" /></p>
<p>I used &#8220;Campaign Monitor&#8221;:http://www.campaignmonitor.com/ for sending the newsletter, and as usual I&#8217;m very pleased with how simple they make this. I did a full customer export from my registration database and Campaign Monitor merged it with the existing list from my newsletter last year, weeding out duplicates and removing anyone who had already unsubscribed.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>What I like most about the &#8220;FastScripts 2.4 release&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/823/fastscripts-2-4 is that Daniel was willing to completely change the product evaluation terms to give new life to the product and get it out to more users.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have been thinking for some time of eliminating FastScripts Lite. Customers found it confusing to differentiate between the versions, and I found it tedious to artificially maintain two versions. With the new, liberal evaluation terms in FastScripts 2.4, all of the old Lite functionality and much more is now included for free in the full version.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s always a risk to make a pricing or demo limit change. Whether accurate or not, I imagine the financial side of product development as a delicate tower of blocks, where the slightest change could cause your whole sales structure to come crashing down. For that reason I tend to not touch anything if it is working, but I recognize that I am probably holding my business back at the same time by not being more flexible.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Paul Kafasis of Rogue Amoeba&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2009/06/04/the-future-of-macworld/ on exhibiting at Macworld 2010:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to be able to plant a flag and say that in 2010, Rogue Amoeba will again be exhibiting at Macworld. We still believe in Macworld and all that it provides. We believe it&#8217;s relevant, useful, and worth having. We believe that meeting new customers, talking to existing ones, and sharing a great time with all manner of Mac friends, is still worth doing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I like companies that make decisions based not just on spreadsheet numbers, but on belief and instinct too. It&#8217;s a shame Apple didn&#8217;t show more of that when weighing whether to continue exhibiting at Macworld. Because Rogue Amoeba doesn&#8217;t sell on the show floor, the conference has to be less about directly recouping costs and more about connecting with customers and building goodwill and name recognition. See also &#8220;Should I Exhibit At Macworld&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2007/01/16/should-i-exhibit-at-macworld-part-1-costs/, from Paul Kafasis in 2007.</p>

			<p>Last week I looked at the SVN log for my application in development and realized that I had started it exactly 1 year ago. While I wasn&#8217;t actively working on it every day or week during that time, that&#8217;s still a very long time for me to work on an application before shipping it. I knew I had to call the 1.0 done and push it out.</p>
<p>I was falling into that infinite 1.0 cycle where I could continue to improve the application forever without releasing it. The sooner I noticed that trap, the sooner I was able to correct course and get the app into the hands of real users.</p>
<p>The app is called &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/. It&#8217;s for importing, tagging, and uploading home movies. I have high hopes for the app and a lot of fun stuff planned for the future.</p>
<p>As usual, a lot of people talked about the product even before I did. My thanks to Dan Moren of Macworld for &#8220;covering the launch&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/140376/2009/05/clipstart.html before I even had a chance to spam him with a press release; to John Gruber for &#8220;posting about how he uses it&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/05/04/clipstart; and to &#8220;Duncan Davidson&#8221;:http://journal.duncandavidson.com/post/102477678/clipstart and &#8220;Mike Zornek&#8221;:http://blog.clickablebliss.com/2009/05/04/clipstart-10/ for their write-ups. I also very much appreciate &#8220;all the retweets&#8221;:http://search.twitter.com/search?q=clipstart and goodwill from my friends on Twitter. Those meant a lot.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to write about MacHeist this year, but after a hail storm damaged nearly every roof in our neighborhood, I noticed something kind of obvious: there are a lot of business that <em>make it up on volume</em>.</p>
<p>This is the new MacHeist promise, right? Not just exposure, although that&#8217;s part of it, but selling so many tens of thousands of copies that the developers do very well regardless of their tiny underpriced cut of the profits per sale.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t get hail in Austin very often. I took the Flip out and &#8220;filmed a little bit of it&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/3443213704, as golf-ball sized balls of ice blanketed the yard. Afterwards every roofing company in Texas descended on Austin offering steep discounts, in some cases even covering an insurance deductable of $2000 or more. Depending on who you ask, such practices may or may not be considered insurance fraud, but like MacHeist it does come with ethical considerations. The roofing companies knew that they could do so much business in the next 2 weeks that they will easily make up for reduced profits by the sheer volume of work.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another kind of discount shared between roofing companies and MacHeist. Users promote the package they just purchased in exchange for further discounts. For MacHeist it&#8217;s spamming your Twitter followers (I get a free Delicious Library!). For roofers it&#8217;s spamming your neighbors with a yard sign (I get $250 off!).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned a few things from all of this that I think will help me make &#8220;my own indie business&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ stronger, or at least more consistent. I gladly give free licenses to reviewers, bloggers, and small Mac user groups. I also routinely do 10-20% off discounts that anyone who knows how to search Twitter or &#8220;RetailMeNot.com&#8221;:http://www.retailmenot.com/ can use.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m just going to have a default &#8220;no thanks&#8221; answer for big promotions and mass giveaways. It&#8217;s consistent with what I believe about keeping prices fair to sustain a Mac business, and it takes the guess work out of which promotions harm the Mac ecosystem and which are a great deal for everyone.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Rob Walling has a good post&#8221;:http://www.softwarebyrob.com/2009/01/07/expenses-you-dont-think-of-when-starting-a-business/ about all the expenses it&#8217;s easy to overlook when starting a software business. The most insightful line is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The point of The Software Product Myth is that at some point you are going to have too few sales to support yourself monetarily, yet too much work to fit comfortably into your evenings and weekends.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This rings true for me. Wii Transfer is too successful to abandon, but not successful enough that I can retire to a beach house. Luckily I love the &#8220;people I work with&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/, but I&#8217;ll admit that running Riverfold on the side is making me a little bit nuts.</p>
<p>I guess the &#8220;good news&#8221; is that I&#8217;m pretty used to too much work and too little sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;This recent post&#8221;:http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/01/05/9-methods-for-mastering-your-money-in-2009/ to start off 2009 covers all the major goals of the site. Here&#8217;s a snippet from budgeting:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are a variety of budgeting methods you can choose, from Andrew Tobias&#8217; three-step budget to the 60% budget. My recent favorite (and a favorite of GRS readers) is Elizabeth Warren&#8217;s balanced money formula: 50% to Needs, 20% to Savings, and everything else to Wants. Simple but effective.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think there&#8217;s something for just about anyone in his blog, whether you are paying off a mountain of credit card debt or starting as an entrepreneur who wants to keep enough cash in the bank to cover those slow months.</p>

			<p>In October I &#8220;blogged about&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2008/10/family_packs.html and then launched a &#8220;family pack&#8221; purchase option for Wii Transfer. $39 for 5 licenses vs. $19 for 1.</p>
<p>The results are in, and they are unspectacular.</p>
<p>2.6% of orders were family pack purchases. At an extra $20 per order, that essentially comes out to the equivalent of one extra sale for every 40.</p>
<p>To all my customers who were honest enough to choose the more expensive option, thank you. I don&#8217;t think most people need the flexibility of running 5 copies of Wii Transfer simultaneously, but I&#8217;m glad that it&#8217;s helpful for a few of you out there.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve written this down and crunched the numbers, it calls to mind something that &#8220;Joel Spolsky&#8221;:http://www.joelonsoftware.com/ said in an interview. All the coupons or referral fees or discount prices or other gimmicks they tried are ultimately just a diversion from the best way to increase sales: make the software better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with this chart for 2008 sales. August was shiny-new-version month.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Forget the developer perspective for a minute. Even as a user I find the race-to-the-bottom iPhone price drops completely maddening. I&#8217;ve bought apps for $5 and $10, and now many of those prices have either been cut in half or lowered to 99 cents. I felt like I got my money&#8217;s worth at the higher price, so I&#8217;m not complaining that I was ripped off. Instead, I just feel like a fool.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve learned my lesson. The message from developers could not be more clear. Apparently the way to buy iPhone software is just to wait a month for the price to drop.</p>
<p>I realized this week that I don&#8217;t consider myself an iPhone developer. Technically I&#8217;ve paid my $99, but I&#8217;ve scrapped all my ideas except a prototype I&#8217;m working on for &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/, and even that I expect someone else to finish and bring to market. If I was an independent iPhone developer I&#8217;d be furious at the instability of pricing on the App Store. Even to users it looks like chaos.</p>

			<p>I rolled out &#8220;family pack&#8221; pricing for &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ over the weekend. I had to make changes to my custom PayPal integration scripts to support it, and I also modified the product page to use a simplified checkout (no standalone store page). Pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>I was less sure about pricing. A quick survey of other Mac developers yielded results like these (normal price / family price &mdash; all of these are for 5 users):</p>
<p>&#8220;Radioshift&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/: $32 / $59</p>
<p>&#8220;Yojimbo&#8221;:http://www.barebones.com/: $39 / $69</p>
<p>&#8220;Hazel&#8221;:http://www.noodlesoft.com/: $21.95 / $39.95</p>
<p>&#8220;iLife&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/ilife/: $79 / $99</p>
<p>&#8220;Bento&#8221;:http://www.filemaker.com/products/bento/: $49 / $99</p>
<p>&#8220;TextExpander&#8221;:http://www.smileonmymac.com/: $29.95 / $44.95</p>
<p>&#8220;MoneyWell&#8221;:http://nothirst.com/: $39.99 / $69.99</p>
<p>Additionally, some companies don&#8217;t have a family pack, but offer discounts for multiple copies:</p>
<p>&#8220;Acorn&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/: $49.95 / 2+ (20% off)</p>
<p>&#8220;On The Job&#8221;:http://www.stuntsoftware.com/: $24.95 / 2+ (20% off)</p>
<p>&#8220;BusySync&#8221;:http://www.busymac.com/: $25 / 5+ (10% off)</p>
<p>&#8220;Transmit&#8221;:http://www.panic.com/: $29.95 / 10+ (10% off)</p>
<p>So 5 copies is the standard for family packs. My original idea was 3 copies for $29, so I threw that out. Five copies for only 50% more seemed way too cheap, especially since Wii Transfer is already the least expensive software of any company I found. True, this is &#8220;free&#8221; money &mdash; most customers don&#8217;t buy more than 1 copy anyway &mdash; but on the other hand they are getting 5 separate serial numbers. Unlike Apple&#8217;s iLife (which has no serial numbers), or Radioshift and BusySync (which allow a special serial number to be used on multiple computers), Wii Transfer&#8217;s URL bookmarking feature requires each copy of Wii Transfer to have a unique serial number to identify the computer.</p>
<p>I think customers buying a family pack are exceptionally honest. They are going out of their way to do the right thing. But at the same time, it needs to be a fair enough price that I&#8217;m not losing anything if a few customers decide to share their &#8220;extra&#8221; serial numbers with a friend.</p>
<p>In the end I settled on $39 for the 5-copy family pack, essentially double the normal price of $19. The Bento pricing model convinced me that it was doable, even if percentage wise it&#8217;s slightly higher than other products. I&#8217;ll be watching stats over the next month to see how well it works. &#8220;Decisions are temporary&#8221;:https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch06_Done.php. I&#8217;m not afraid to change the family price or drop it altogether if it doesn&#8217;t meet my expectations.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last month, on the 7th episode of Core Intuition, we talked about promotion. In particular I had good things to say about Campaign Monitor, and the folks who built it heard the episode and wanted to ask a set of follow-up questions to use on their own blog. &#8220;That mini-interview with me&#8221;:http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2008/10/manton_reece_talks_email_marke.html about how I used the service is now online.</p>
<p>In closing out that blog post, Mathew Patterson of Freshview suggests a couple things I agree with, including sending a newsletter more frequently than once a year. In fact I would love to send another one soon, to link up a survey to get some more information about why customers are purchasing Wii Transfer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my hands are tied with yearly. When I put together the Wii giveaway promotion, I specifically told users opting in that it would be about once a year. I did this to encourage people to sign up without wondering if they would be spammed all the time. And also, I doubted that I would have the time to send a newsletter much more often than every year. So it&#8217;s not ideal, but there it is.</p>
<p>Since then we&#8217;ve recorded 2 more shows. The latest &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ hits the lifting of the NDA, the iPhone Tech Talk Tour, and Apple&#8217;s stock price.</p>

			<p>Last week I blogged about &#8220;my experience with a late Amazon order&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2008/09/almostright_amazon.html, commenting that I was a happy customer again after they apologized. Even after being mistreated, customers will forgive everything if only the company does the right thing in the future. It&#8217;s the same way an angry customer will fire off a support email rant but then become an advocate for the company if the company responds quickly and honestly.</p>
<p>Thank you, Apple. &#8220;Lifting the NDA&#8221;:http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/ has turned the whole developer community into optimists overnight.</p>
