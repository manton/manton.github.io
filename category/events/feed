				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best blog posts we write are as much for ourselves as for our readers. That&#8217;s one of the traits that makes personal blogging so special.</p>
<p>I published <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/10/a-great-developer-can-come-from-anywhere.html">my essay last week</a> from the hotel at <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/conference">Release Notes</a>, right before heading downstairs as the conference got underway. Almost no one had read it yet, but the essay still helped me because it made me even more aware of when I accidentally monopolized a conversation. I did end up talking a lot about my new project while at Release Notes, but I also caught myself many times, making sure to turn the conversation around and <em>listen</em>.</p>
<p>And there was plenty to hear at Release Notes. I got something out of every talk and from many conversations with developers who I had never met before. Congratulations to Charles and Joe for putting together a great conference.</p>
<p>Highlights for me included Myke Hurley&#8217;s opening talk on Wednesday night about quitting his job and the first full-time year of <a href="http://www.relay.fm/">Relay FM</a>; Rob Rhyne&#8217;s fantastic whirlwind tour of accounting, which scared me a little because of everything I still don&#8217;t know about being independent; Jean MacDonald&#8217;s talk about podcast sponsorships and the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/appcamp4girls">fundraiser for App Camp for Girls</a>; Pieter Omvlee&#8217;s advice on aiming to build a bigger business; and David Smith&#8217;s talk, which I&#8217;ll get to later. I could pull out lessons from each of these talks as well as the others from Rachel Andrew, Georgia Dow, John Saddington, Chris Liscio, Daniel Pasco, and Jim Dalrymple.</p>
<p>Thursday night was the &#8220;dine around&#8221;, a clever idea to split attendees into groups of about a dozen people, each meeting for dinner at an assigned restaurant. It&#8217;s easy to fall into cliques at conferences. This was a great solution to mixing it up, all but guaranteeing that you&#8217;ll meet someone new.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth saying something about the venue. Converted from the Indianapolis Union Station, which was built in 1853, the conference center and hotel served as a beautiful backdrop to the conference. My hotel room was even made from an old train car. As we left the conference center late Friday afternoon, I took another look up at the vaulted ceiling and stained glass windows, making a mental note to read more about <a href="http://www.walkindianapolis.org/union.html">the history of the original train station</a>.</p>
<p>On Saturday I checked out of the hotel, walked up to <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/bee-coffee-roasters/51ae6176498ee875488bf40d">Bee Coffee Roasters</a> (where I ran into a couple other attendees who were also still processing everything we learned at the conference), and then took an Uber to the airport. My driver was a musician; he had toured the country playing with bands, was working on a soundtrack which he played on CD for me, and had such an optimistic take on the world that it struck me in obvious contrast to the negativity we see online sometimes.</p>
<p>And he said something that stayed with me even longer while I waited at airport security and for my flight to board. He said that everything he had wanted to do in life, he had done. Sure, he&#8217;d love to tour with another band, he&#8217;d love to find success with his new music. But already he was content. He laughed when he said he could die happy, and he was not old.</p>
<p>David Smith mentioned in his talk at Release Notes that he used to want to do everything. Have a best selling app, win a design award, be admired by his peers, and other goals that many of us share. It was only when he set out with a more singular focus — judging every decision by whether it moved his business forward so he could continue to support his family — that all the other secondary goals started taking care of themselves as well. It was a great talk and something I needed to hear.</p>
<p>As a community we&#8217;re ambitious. We want to build something amazing and we want to make a positive impact on the world. But this week was also a reminder to me that it&#8217;s okay to be more focused, to tackle niche vertical apps, or make small boring decisions that will help our business. It&#8217;s okay, even as we want to do more, to slow down and be proud and content with the path that we&#8217;re on.</p>

For the last few years I’ve attended the NeXT-themed fundraiser for the Cartoon Art Museum, and this year <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/7/an-hour-of-next-history">there’s video from the event</a>. Check it out for a view into the museum and some of the talks.</p>
<p>It’s always a highlight of the week for me to visit both the Cartoon Art Museum and the Walt Disney Family Museum. This year Cartoon Art had pre-production drawings and paintings from the hand-drawn film Song of the Sea, one of my favorite films of the year. Really beautiful stuff.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the week I posted about WWDC to <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">my microblog</a>, but I thought I&#8217;d write a longer post with the week&#8217;s narrative. It&#8217;s useful to have these to refer to in the future when all the WWDCs blur together and I&#8217;ve forgotten which event was which. Where it adds any details I&#8217;ll link to a few of the shorter posts.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s go back to Sunday morning a week ago when I arrived in San Francisco, ticketless but ready to learn and meet up with friends. What a great day. First burritos and coffee in the Mission, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2676.html">then to Oakland</a> for the NBA finals, game 2. I had signed up on the Golden State Warriors mailing list a couple weeks earlier to get in on the pre-sale tickets. Excepting the nearby San Antonio Spurs, I&#8217;m almost never going to just coincidentally be in the <em>same city</em> as an NBA finals game. I couldn&#8217;t let that chance slip by.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/wwdc_warriors.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="Golden State Warriors" border="0" /></p>
<p>And it was an amazing game. Outwardly I was rooting for the Warriors — high fives to fans when the team came back to force overtime, wearing my new yellow shirt they gave everyone at the game. But inwardly I was also marveling at LeBron&#8217;s dominance and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2678.html">happy to see the series tied up</a>. I want to see this thing go to 7 games.</p>
<p>Monday was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2680.html">the keynote</a> and later the Cartoon Art Museum / NeXT fundraiser, with beautiful art on the wall from one of my favorite films this year, Song of the Sea. Tuesday I tried to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2688.html">catch up on some code</a> at Sightglass Coffee, watch sessions at WeWork, and installed the <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2684.html">iOS 9 beta</a> on my retina iPad Mini. In the evening on this day and others there were parties, though I only attended a few.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/wwdc_talkshow.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="The Talk Show" border="0" /></p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/live/">The Talk Show live</a> with guest Phil Schiller was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2690.html">a great surprise</a>. I&#8217;m so happy for John and his success. Developers who have only known Daring Fireball after it was already fairly popular may need this important reminder: John Gruber started a dozen years ago <em>with a blog that no one read</em>, just like the rest of us, and this week he conducted the best interview of a senior Apple executive I&#8217;ve ever seen. If you think it&#8217;s enough to just throw random quips to Twitter, it&#8217;s not enough. Blogging is still the best way to build an audience. (Don&#8217;t miss <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/06/11/live-with-phil">Marco&#8217;s post</a> about the event and what it means for the new Apple.)</p>
<p>I have very little to complain to Apple about this year. Maybe the keynote was a little long, but the topics they hit and the new user features and APIs were exactly right. I&#8217;ve got Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan installed and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2707.html">will require it for my next Mac app</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/wwdc_bridge.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="Golden State Bridge" border="0" /></p>
<p>Toward the middle of the week I wasn&#8217;t feeling particularly great — not sick, but not really upbeat enough to get excited about new APIs. I escaped the city for the afternoon on Wednesday, visiting the Walt Disney Family Museum and then walking down to Crissy Field toward the Golden Gate Bridge. I stretched my arms out wide to catch the wind and felt refreshed in a way that the stagnant weather back in Austin this time of year can&#8217;t hope to provide. I remember <a href="https://twitter.com/manton/statuses/211946809994653696">this tweet from 2012</a> and it&#8217;s always true again, year after year.</p>
<p>Thursday morning I caught <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2696.html">a session at AltConf</a> before heading to the airport. Flights were delayed out of SFO because of fog, so it was 3 hours waiting in San Francisco, and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2700.html">another 3 hours</a> waiting in Phoenix after a missed connection. But it&#8217;s all good. WWDC was a little weird for me — not because of anything Apple did, just because I was a little wistful, and distracted by email and non-WWDC happenings too.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I&#8217;m inspired by the week. The success of both AltConf and now <a href="http://www.bringyourlayers.com/">Layers</a>, not to mention all the other smaller events and keynote watch parties, point to a very strong WWDC for years to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week my Instagram timeline included a bunch of really beautiful photos from folks in Ireland for Úll. <a href="http://sixcolors.com/2015/03/notes-and-podcasts-from-ireland/">Jason Snell writes</a> about the conference:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The location, in Killarney in county Kerry, is spectacular. It’s rainy and windy and the different patterns on the surface of the lake right outside the hotel are beautiful to watch.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There were a lot of neat ideas for Úll that I bet made it special, including <a href="http://2015.ull.ie/site/blog/childrenstrack">a kids track</a> and the <a href="http://2015.ull.ie/site/blog/the-ull-train-is-a-coming">train ride</a>. I’m a sucker for anything train related, for example the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/conference/#venue">train car hotel rooms</a> in the upcoming Release Notes conference venue.</p>
<p>These special touches transform a conference into half work, half vacation. Every technical thing you might want to learn is on the internet these days anyway. Conferences should be about inspiration as much as anything else, and a great setting is part of that.</p>
<p><a href="http://sixcolors.com/link/2015/04/tickets-still-available-for-yosemite-conference/">Here’s Jason again</a>, writing about the national park location for Yosemite CocoaConf:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “As I just experienced at Úll in Ireland, these sorts of conferences are truly special. It’s a chance for a small group of people who share an interest in Apple and related technologies to spend a few days together. They’re always a blast, but add in the unique setting of Yosemite National Park and this one promises to be that much more amazing.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry to miss that one. For the last several years I’ve mostly fallen into a pattern of traveling to attend just one non-WWDC conference a year. This year I’ll be <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/session/details/649">speaking at CocoaConf in Austin</a> and hope to make <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/conference/">Release Notes</a> as well. Tickets for CocoaConf are on sale now, and Release Notes tickets should be announced soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday this weblog turned 13 years old. I don’t usually miss the anniversary; it’s a nice time to reflect on what I’m writing about here. But I’ve been incredibly busy this year, working on a range of things from real work to side projects to family stuff.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I also helped out at the annual <a href="http://www.staple-austin.org/">STAPLE!</a> comics show in Austin. This is always a great time to check out what independent artists are up to, and as usual I came away inspired to get back into drawing.</p>
<p>I’ll have a longer write-up about yesterday’s Apple event soon. I have a very negative opinion about the $10k Apple Watch Edition — not because it’s expensive, but because of what focusing on the super rich says about Apple’s priorities. Daniel and I talked about this at length on <a href="http://coreint.org/174">Core Intuition episode 174</a> a couple weeks ago.</p>
<p>Overall the event was great, though. I’m looking forward to pre-ordering a watch and getting into development. Leaning toward the 42mm Sport, with blue band and an extra classic buckle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“This is it,” a friend said to me as we were walking up Market Street with other developers, late at night as WWDC was winding down several years ago. The iPhone had hit. The conference was getting bigger. Apple was on the verge of becoming a giant in the industry and you could feel it in the air — a coming change that was obvious only from a distance because it disappeared as you reached for it, like San Francisco fog rolling over the bay. “This is the height of the conference and it’s never going to be like this again.”</p>
<p>Looking back it perfectly captured what I think of as the second “era” of WWDC. It was a kind of golden age for Mac and iOS developers, with a new generation of successful Mac indies and before the iOS race to the bottom was much past the starting line.</p>
<p>From my perspective, learning Mac development in the mid 90s, there are three distinct eras of Apple’s WWDC. My first WWDCs were at the San Jose Convention Center. The developer base was small enough that you consistently ran into everyone, companies like Metrowerks and even Adobe seemed to have an influence on the conference, and Apple frequently showed off new APIs that might not actually ship soon or ever. It was an exciting time to be a Mac developer but the rest of the world didn’t care. This was the backdrop for the failed Copland project, for Steve Jobs coming back, for the clash between Carbon and Cocoa, and the acceptance of Mac OS X.</p>
<p>The next era was at the move to San Francisco. The conference was getting bigger but Apple attempted to keep the events and themes that made WWDC the same, even for a while busing attendees to the beer bash in Cupertino. This is the time when the iPhone SDK arrived and the conference exploded. I think most developers will always look back at this time as something amazing. It’s the backdrop for that walk up Market Street and a dozen similar conversations.</p>
<p>Now we’re in the third modern era of WWDC, with one undeniable characteristic: a small percentage of developers can get a ticket to the conference. The community, however, is as strong as ever, and there’s still a desire to have WWDC be that “one place” that developers can meet each year. It’s a need that smaller, regional conferences, no matter how important they are, just can’t fill.</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://jamesdempsey.net/2014/04/18/life-without-wwdc/">this post from James Dempsey</a> because it starts with the assumption that <em>not</em> getting a WWDC ticket is the new normal:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Once something changes from being dependably available to rarely available, you begin to form alternate plans and take alternate paths.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s right. Since it’s likely that Apple will continue to iterate slowly instead of making major changes to grow the conference, we’re better off adapting. By adapting we can focus on preserving the community aspects of WWDC that are arguably just as important as the technical tracks.</p>
<p>And change comes slowly to WWDC. I realized while watching (https://developer.apple.com/tech-talks/videos/) recently that Apple just doesn’t see a big problem. John Geleynse described a situation where only one person from a team is at WWDC; the rest of the company is back at the office watching videos and sending questions to their coworker at the conference to ask in the labs. Getting videos out the same day makes the conference more useful for both those without a ticket and actual attendees (and their team) too.</p>
<p>(I still have complaints about how WWDC tickets are distributed and why Apple doesn’t attempt to grow the conference a little more, but the lottery is an improvement over last year. See Core Intuition <a href="http://coreint.org/132">episodes 132</a> and <a href="http://coreint.org/133">133</a> for a full discussion.)</p>
<p>I’ll be in San Francisco for a few days next week — at <a href="http://www.altconf.com/">AltConf</a>, at the <a href="http://guestlistapp.com/events/250698">Cartoon Art Museum fundraiser</a>, catching up on session videos, <a href="http://bb.zaarly.com">waiting in line</a> for coffee, hiding in my hotel room writing code, and getting some good food and drink with fellow developers. WWDC means something different now, but it matters just as much as it always has. Hope to see you there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2014/05/24/what_happened_at_userland">Brent Simmons has another expanded résumé</a> of sorts, following his post about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/05/newsgator_and_sepia.html">working at NewsGator</a>. I love this write-up because it mirrors a lot of the work I was doing, so it brings back a lot of memories. I was actively using Frontier for client work and <a href="http://www.manton.org/archive/idiom/mactivity_presentation/">crazy side projects</a>; one of my co-workers for a time was Mason Hale, who built an early CGI framework for Frontier; and I loosely worked with Dave Winer to help run the frontier-talk mailing list and hack on a potential WebSTAR plug-in for Frontier. (Though I was still a pretty poor C programmer back then. Someone else ended up shipping it.)</p>
<p>Back when the job description “webmaster” still meant something, I worked for the WebEdge conference which brought together the best web developers for the Mac OS. WebEdge hosted <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/09/12/MidnightPlanetoWindows.html">the first meeting of the Macintosh Internet Developer Association</a> (MIDAS), led in part by Dave Winer. And I was always playing with the tools that came out of Userland, from Manilla to Radio Userland. I used Radio to run this blog <a href="http://www.manton.org/2004/03/thank_you.html">until 2004</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the developers from that time have faded away, moved on to other projects away from the public spotlight. But not Brent. He just shipped <a href="http://vesperapp.co/blog/vesper-2-0-and-vesper-sync/">Vesper 2.0</a> and it’s some of his best work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Found via <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/">Shawn Blanc</a>, CJ Chilvers <a href="http://alesserphotographer.com/blog/2013/11/6/you-have-a-reputation">writes about the reputation of photographers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I look at their blogs and the consideration given to advertisers over readers. I look at their Twitter feeds that have become broadcasts, rather than conversations. I look at their Instagram feeds and see a stream of consciousness, instead of considered examples of the work that makes them proud.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It reminds me of one of my favorite parts of <a href="http://vimeo.com/m/80601533">Christina Warren’s talk at this year’s Çingleton</a>, where she told the story of turning down work she wouldn’t be proud of, even though she was still struggling as a professional writer. That your reputation will outlast your current job or project:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “If I give up my name — which I’m starting to build and people are starting to respect — by doing stuff like this, what does that mean? I can’t ever live this down. All I have is my name.”
</p></blockquote>

<p>Daniel Jalkut and I talked more about the general themes of Çingleton a couple months ago, on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2013/10/episode-110-always-go-for-the-cheap-one/">Core Intuition episode 110</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shawn Blanc looks back to <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2010/04/diary-of-an-ipad-owner/">a post 3 years ago</a> about his experience buying and using the first iPad. From waiting in line:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “<strong>7:32 am:</strong> A young guy and his mom get in line behind us. The guy is wearing a ‘WWSJD’ t-shirt. I like to think that I’m less nerdy than he is, but the fact is I am <em>ahead of him</em> in line.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I wish I had written so many detailed notes. I did, however, find an old draft blog post with my current list of apps from back then. Here’s what I was running on my first iPad in early April, 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitterrific.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NetNewsWire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instapaper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freeform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sketchbook Pro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OmniGraffle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And free apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>AIM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iBooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kindle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Netflix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New York Times Editors’ Choice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And a couple games, like Flight Control HD.</p>
<p>Of those paid apps, I’m only still routinely using Instapaper today, and — even though I’m not on Twitter — occasionally Twitterrific. NetNewsWire for iPad in particular held up very well; I used it every day for probably 2 years <em>after</em> it had stopped being updated.</p>
<p>Most of the apps that were released for the iPad’s debut were more mature than apps from the iPhone OS 2.0 release and first App Store. By the time the iPad came along, developers seemed to have gotten the hang of the platform.</p>
