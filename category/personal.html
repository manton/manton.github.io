			<p>After blogging every day for a couple weeks at the end of July, I decided to take a break while my family and I took a vacation to London and Paris over the last 10 days. Instead we kept a private-ish travel blog of the trip. It&#8217;s similar to what I might post in a private journal (handwritten or <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a>), but accessible to family in a richer &#8220;own your own content&#8221; way than just Facebook photos.</p>
<p>I also posted 7 photos throughout the trip to <a href="https://instagram.com/manton">my Instagram account</a>. I like to use Instagram to capture just the very best photo from something, so the timeline never feels overloaded. Of course we took hundreds of photos overall. Some went to the trip blog, some went to Instagram and Facebook, some went to Snapchat (teenagers!), and the rest we&#8217;ll sort through as we have time. We had wi-fi in the apartments and so I made sure everything was synced up to Dropbox at least once a day.</p>
<p>I worked a little while traveling, but could only be so productive without getting in the way of enjoying the vacation. I&#8217;m catching up on some email and client work this morning. Feeling fairly rested despite a very long travel day coming back home.</p>

			<p><em>&#8220;Am I always starting over<br />
In a brand new story?<br />
Am I always back at one<br />
After all I&#8217;ve done?&#8221;<br />
— <a href="https://itun.es/us/5MKtZ?i=860769901">Always Starting Over</a>, from the broadway show If/Then</em></p>
<p>Daniel said on the <a href="http://coreint.org/192">latest Core Intuition</a> that it’s important to celebrate major work milestones, like shipping a new app or quitting a job. I didn’t think I’d be celebrating right away, but as it turned out, my wife met me for lunch on Friday and we had a beer to mark the occasion. She snapped this photo:</p>
<p><center><a href="https://instagram.com/p/5z8rowxMfV/"><img src="../images/2015/whole_foods_lunch_beer.jpg" width="400" height="400" border="0" /></a></center></p>
<p>Some things just work out. I couldn’t have picked a better t-shirt to wear if I had planned it.</p>
<p>When 5pm came around I made a final comment on Confluence, replied to a couple emails, and then signed out of HipChat. But I didn&#8217;t have time for much reflection. My son and I were busy packing up to head to a campout with Boy Scouts. Then as soon as we arrived back the next day, I turned around again to take my daughter to see <a href="http://idinamenzel.com/">Idina Menzel</a>.</p>
<p>The concert was incredible, somehow including both Wicked&#8217;s &#8220;Defying Gratify&#8221; and Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;Creep&#8221; — and yes, of course Frozen — to make a show with both the occasional explicit lyric <em>and</em>  little kids pulled up from the audience to sing. It was only while driving home from the concert that I had a moment to think what I need to do next. Idina&#8217;s lines from If/Then at the beginning of this post kept coming back to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked a long time on a few things, and they were pretty good, but now it&#8217;s time to start over. I turn 40 in a few months. It&#8217;s time to figure out what the next 10 years of my life should be about.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last week at <a href="http://twitter.com/nsdrinking">NSDrinking</a> we had one of our biggest turnouts yet. At one point, we’re talking about programming jobs, meetups, and Apple, and Jordan Breeding was mentioned. Not in the context of having passed away, but just in remembering something he had said or done. A stranger listening to the conversation would have no idea that Jordan wasn’t still a member of the community.</p>
<p>This struck me as exactly right. I think anyone would would want to be remembered as <em>who they were</em>, not how they left us.</p>
<p>Like many in our developer community, I&#8217;ve thought about Jordan Breeding at certain moments over the last couple months. <a href="http://www.patrickburleson.com/2015/02/09/remembering-jordan-breeding/">Patrick Burleson shared a story</a> about his close friend:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “For those that knew Jordan, they know that he was a incredibly generous and caring person. He did so many things for so many people, it’s a wonder he ever got anything else done.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ideveloper.co/podcast135/">Episode 135 of the iDeveloper podcast</a> opened with a segment remembering Jordan. Scotty and John did a great job of capturing what he meant to the community. Scotty says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Everybody has said really the same things about him. Firstly, how clever he was. He was an incredibly intelligent person. But secondly, how generous and humble he was with that intelligence, and how he shared with people. He always made you feel like you could be better, and do better, and was always having a laugh about things.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Guy English also dedicated <a href="http://www.imore.com/60-melton-ganatra-episode-iii-shipping-software">episode 60 of the Debug podcast</a> to Jordan. <a href="http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/514">On his blog</a> he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Good guy. I didn’t know him well but he always struck me as someone I’d like to get to know better. I lost out on that and too many others did too. Those who knew him universally loved him.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Kyle Richter worked with Jordan and <a href="http://kylerichter.com/jordan/">had this to say</a>, echoing Patrick’s quote above about how Jordan went out of his way for other people:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We were having dinner with some friends in California and my iPhone was acting up. Jordan volunteered to break away from the pack and come to the Apple Store with me. You rarely get to pick your last time with a friend, my last time with Jordan was him fighting with the Apple Store staff on my behalf. That was Jordan, even with everything he was going through he never thought of himself first.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://storify.com/gruber/jordan-breeding">a collection of tweets</a> via John Gruber. You know when reading any of these that Jordan will be remembered for a long time. He accomplished a great deal and went far, quickly, and that progress is a personal inspiration whenever I consider accelerating the change in my own career. Carpe diem.</p>

			<p>Over two years ago, I carefully planned <a href="http://watermark.io/collections/manton/myfinaltweets">my final tweets</a> so that they would serve as a proper closing to that chapter of being active on Twitter.

			<p>10 years ago, when everyone else had cable, we were sick of the monthly bill and the mindlessly infinite channel list and cancelled it. I was happy to never have to deal with Time Warner again. But a couple years ago, we subscribed again to keep up with some of our favorite shows. Finally <a href="http://www.techhive.com/article/2834118/hbo-shoots-back-at-netflix-with-plans-for-standalone-streaming-video-service.html">things are changing</a>, and I expect we&#8217;ll cancel again before too long.</p>
<p>This on-again, off-again relationship with cable is also how we treat having a second car. Working at home for the last 13 years, even with taking the kids to school and various errands, my wife and I rarely need to be in two places at once. So we downsized to one car long ago, then got a second car for a few years, then downsized again a couple years ago. With my daughters to high school, I knew we&#8217;d need another car soon, but it was nice not having an extra car payment and even better to have an excuse to bike to coffee shops.</p>
<p>I promised myself and my son, who is already living in the future, that our next car would be 100% electric. I kept up with new Tesla models and their growing <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/supercharger">Supercharger infrastructure</a>, but realistically Tesla is out of reach. There&#8217;s no way to justify the price for just driving to the elementary school a mile away, a nearby coffee shop, or around town every couple days.</p>
<p>So three weeks ago we picked up a <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/electric-cars/leaf/">Nissan Leaf</a>. Because our needs (and battery technology) keep changing, we&#8217;re leasing it and we&#8217;ll decide at the end whether to pay the difference and keep it. It&#8217;s a fun little car, so quiet and effortless to drive, and the kids love it.</p>
<p>Obviously our &#8220;normal&#8221; gas-powered car will remain the primary family car and the one that we take on road trips. The Leaf goes about 85 miles fully charged and plugs into the normal outlet in our garage, as if we were just plugging in Christmas lights. I&#8217;ve also used the charging stations at Whole Foods, where I usually go for coffee and work once or twice a week. (We skipped the recommended 240V home charging kit for now, which charges significantly faster. For comparison, Tesla&#8217;s range is closer to 250 miles.)</p>
<p>While I&#8217;ve always been pretty good at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-efficient_driving">hypermiling</a>, the Leaf has made me even more conscious of it. I drove to my daughter&#8217;s basketball game in Georgetown last week, 30 miles away on the toll road. Sustaining 75mph is the worst and dragged my miles/kWh down a notch. On the way back, I drove the more direct, non-toll route and got significantly more efficiency at respectable speeds with some breaking.</p>
<p>But cruising down the highway it&#8217;s easy to see that this is the way the world should be, in time. Good new tech always reminds me of that first feeling we got when using the original iPhone, how it felt like the whole thing was from 5 years in the future. It&#8217;s not that extreme with the Leaf, but I still see a little of that, a glimpse that it&#8217;s more advanced than it should be. I think this may be the best car I&#8217;ve ever owned.</p>

			<p>Two great blog posts yesterday from Brent Simmons that I think are related, though I read one early in the day and the other catching up on RSS feeds late at night. First, <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/12/12/one_year_anniversary">on quitting his job</a> to work full-time on Vesper:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “A year ago I was a designer for an enterprise app I didn’t care about — or even like in the least tiny bit — and which you’ve never seen or heard of. That’s no way to live.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It reminds me, of course, of the famous Steve Jobs quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And then, <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/12/12/the_stream">Brent says about Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The 140-character stream is where things not worth saying, and not worth reading, thrive. It’s where things actually worth saying get over-simplified and then get lost, if they get said at all.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, do something you care about, write something lasting. The older I get, the more both of these resonate with me. And even though I haven’t posted to Twitter in over a year, I think I needed to read that post to focus back on this blog, where my writing should live.</p>

			<p>I met Aaron briefly at SXSW, maybe 8 or 9 years ago, when the conference was still so small you could run into everyone. He wouldn’t remember me, but I followed his work and linked to him a couple times here. He was so young and already doing great things.</p>
<p><a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully">Lawrence Lessig</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “He was brilliant, and funny. A kid genius. A soul, a conscience, the source of a question I have asked myself a million times: What would Aaron think?”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2013/01/12/aaron_swartz">Brent Simmons</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “He’d gone on to do cool things — and make some mistakes, and get in trouble for them. But I knew he was extraordinary, and I expected him to grow up to become an American hero.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html">Cory Doctorow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and issues. I think he could have revolutionized American (and worldwide) politics. His legacy may still yet do so.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2013/01/12/aaron-swartz/">Daniel Jalkut</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “After witnessing a small extent of the struggles Aaron fought, I choose to commemorate him with gratitude for the many bad weeks when he resisted drastic action, and gave us all more time to appreciate and share his contributions.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>…<a href="http://twitter.com/danielpunkass/statuses/290318018901319680">and</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “You’ve honored Aaron Swartz by acknowledging what he did before he died. Now honor him by doing what he might have done.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Such a loss. For more links, <a href="http://watermark.io/collections/manton/aaronswartz1986-2013">I started a collection of tweets</a> when my timeline woke up to the news of Aaron’s death.</p>

			<p>From a &#8220;beautiful post by Craig Mod&#8221;:http://craigmod.com/satellite/nourishing_wake/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I pulled all of the poison out of the air &mdash; I drew it deep into my lungs and exhaled into my socks. My socks are full of the radiation, don&#8217;t touch the socks. I pulled the tsunami back. I drew the inland water back into the ocean. I pulled it over the rice paddies, unflattening them; the trees, straightening them &mdash; a billion billion leaves fluttering back into position. I drew the water back, back, back. It was easy because it was what I had to do, I tell her looking her straight in the eyes. Perhaps you don&#8217;t understand, but I had to.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			<p>&#8220;Via Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/09/12/lanyrd, I&#8217;m loving &#8220;this blog and idea&#8221;:http://sparkabout.net/ from newlyweds Simon Willison and Natalie Downe, who are traveling the world on a working honeymoon:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been in Morocco now for just over a month. We launched Lanyrd from a rented apartment in Casablanca, and we&#8217;re writing this update from a Riad in Marrakech. So far, travelling and working on a startup have complemented each other surprisingly well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1999, Traci and I took a similar but shorter 2-month vacation to Europe where we both worked remotely. This was before wi-fi, so much of the destination planning centered around pay-by-the-hour internet cafes or reliable hotel phone lines for dial-up. Lots of backpacking, cheap rooms, and trains and boats between 6 countries. We were constantly broke and our accommodations varied between the crummy (freezing showers at a hostel) to the beautiful (freezing showers with a Mediterranean view), but those were easily some of the best weeks of my life. At the end of the trip we got engaged and came back to America to get married and have kids and never leave our neighborhood again.</p>
<p>Someday we&#8217;ll go back.</p>

			<p>I like this paragraph from a &#8220;long post by Mike Lee&#8221;:http://le.mu.rs/motherfucker/Entries/2010/7/1_Fuck_modesty.html</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;On any project, whether it&#8217;s a band performance or a team shipping, there&#8217;s a time to curse, and a time to praise. Someone who gets those in the right order is an inspiring leader. Someone who gets them backwards is just an asshole.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned on a recent &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2010/06/episode-31-skipping-the-morning-session/ episode, I have a really hard time remembering who I meet unless I read their blog, or follow them on Twitter, or have heard about their reputation. None of these were true when I first met Mike Lee, walking to pizza one night at C4&#91;1&#93;. I didn&#8217;t even know at the time that he worked at Delicious Monster. But it didn&#8217;t matter because he essentially opened with: &#8220;I was hit by a car last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bam! World&#8217;s toughest programmer indeed, and now I&#8217;ll never forget his face or the conversation. We can&#8217;t all be as relentlessly passionate and memorable as Mike, but there is a lesson here in personal brand: finding what sets us apart from every other programmer and letting that shape our voice and the projects we work on.</p>

			<p>My son is seriously into LEGO Star Wars right now. He&#8217;ll spend hours every day building ships, and it&#8217;s the most incredible thing watching how good he&#8217;s gotten at it over the last couple of months. For his birthday we ordered him the X-wing set, which is &#8220;all kinds of awesome&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/3766379995.</p>
<p>One of my favorite posts to this blog was partially about LEGOs. &#8220;In 2006 I wrote&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2006/01/limitations_in_toys.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If the toy is made to do a few specific amazing things, with a bunch of bullet points and exclamation marks on the side of the box, be weary of it. For example, modern LEGOs come in all sorts of pre-molded shapes. If you buy the pirate set, it will be great fun for the first few days until you realize that it can only be a pirate ship. But if you buy a bucket of LEGOs (yes, they still sell these), you can build a pirate ship one day and a barn the next.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot more to the post, and I still believe what I wrote. But it turns out that LEGO Star Wars sets are surprisingly well designed. There are very few custom pieces, and almost all the sets (we must have about 10) share the same shapes, just with different colors and for different purposes. I&#8217;m a big fan now.</p>
<p><center><img src="../images/2009/lego_minifigures.jpg" alt="lego_minifigures.jpg" border="0" width="450" height="332" /></center></p>
<p>Tonight we sat in bed together and looked at LEGO catalogs. I&#8217;m in those awesome years where being a dad is just like being a kid again, and this post is to capture a little part of that moment, before it&#8217;s gone.</p>

			<p>In my &#8220;last post about family pricing&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2008/10/family_packs.html, I mentioned that I modified my PayPal scripts for backend order processing to support family packs, but I left out that the whole system is a hack. A hack that processes a nice chunk of money, but a hack nonetheless. Hard-coded PayPal buttons and coupons, PHP that would make even newbie web developers cringe, too few lines of code to really be taken seriously.</p>
<p>I refactored it a few months ago, but kept some ugliness in there to remind myself that I should move to a &#8220;mature store solution&#8221;:http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore. Sometimes we build systems that are flawed from the start, and it&#8217;s wasted effort to invest time into something that will be replaced. Instead, let the thing stand out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a complement to doing things simply and taking shortcuts even when it&#8217;s tempting to overengineer and build the perfect system.</p>
<p>This ugliness trick works for other things too. For example, the Wii Transfer product page is /software/wiitransfer/ instead of just /wiitransfer. I gave this URL more thought and second-guessing than it deserved, and every time I type /software/ or see the link I cringe a little. But I did it for a purpose: one day I hope to sell or promote things other than software. For example, when I registered riverfold.com I was working on an independent animated film which I planned to sell on DVD direct to customers. (I&#8217;ve had that shelved for years now, though, as I&#8217;ve recently discovered there are only 24 hours in a day.)</p>
<p>Others will say that you shouldn&#8217;t mix such different projects under the same brand, and that makes a lot of sense. But I also know it to be true that if you want to build a strong blog following, you should stick to one subject and become a respected voice in that field, and I didn&#8217;t do that either. I made a conscious decision with my personal blog to keep it loose and cover several different things that I am passionate about, and because of that I&#8217;ll likely never have tens of thousands of readers as other popular Mac development blogs have.</p>
<p>So maybe one day Riverfold will sell something other than Mac software. When that time comes, it won&#8217;t matter what the URLs are, but until then, the /software/ URL won&#8217;t let me ever forget that I have other things in mind.</p>

<p>We should have another 80-degree day today before it gets cold again. As much as I complain that it doesn&#8217;t snow in Austin &mdash; that wouldn&#8217;t it be great if the kids could live a real winter at least every couple of years, the kind they read about in books and newspaper comics &mdash; I have to admit that it&#8217;s pretty nice to be outside with a t-shirt in the middle of winter.</p>
<p>Funny thing about mornings. I could sleep until noon every day if kids and work didn&#8217;t prevent me, but I seem to be most productive early anyway. Stepping into my home office still dreary eyed and without breakfast, catching up on tweets and email from Europeans and other night owls, then settling into source code or design or testing with some amount of quiet before the rest of the world sends another batch of distractions my way.</p>
<p>Forget the realities of slipping release schedules and buggy software. Morning is that special time when everything still seems possible.</p>

			<p>We planted some trees in our front yard recently. They take decades to grow, and we are under no illusion that they&#8217;ll provide meaningful shade before our children have families of their own. It&#8217;s easy to say: &#8220;Why should I bother?

			<p>The other night I was digging around in other people&#8217;s old blog posts, catching up on things I never read but should, and I found this gem on &#8220;Seth Godin&#8217;s blog&#8221;:http://sethgodin.typepad.com/.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k08yxu57NA"><img src="../images/2008/paul_potts.jpg" alt="paul_potts.jpg" border="0" width="278" height="200" style="border: 1px solid gray;"  /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Watch it on YouTube&#8221;:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1k08yxu57NA and then come back here.</p>
<p>Maybe the video and show is old news to everyone else, but I was stunned. A seemingly unremarkable man, by his own admission lacking confidence, the judges and audience clearly expecting the worst, expecting humiliation.</p>
<p>And then he is transformed. He nails it.</p>
<p>I consider myself reasonably competent, but not great, at what I do. My weakness is that I have my hands in too many unrelated projects to ever master one thing. The areas I am most passionate about receive a cruel pittance of attention. Not so with Paul Potts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s inspiring to see someone who is just freakin&#8217; good, rising above expectation out of a bland job to surprise and overwhelm everyone around him.</p>
<p>Oh, and the nice thing about discovering this video late? I can fast-forward to the finish. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the winning performance&#8221;:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDB9zwlXrB8 with some additional backstory.</p>

			<p>The 2-hour season finale for Lost last year was some of the best television you&#8217;ll ever see. I re-watched it a few days ago and it was great stuff. And yet, I had a feeling that season 3, which premiered this week, would reset the clock again. Introduce a few more characters, change all the usual assumptions, but leave more questions instead of answering the existing ones.</p>
<p>Turns out it was even worse than that. Frankly, the start of season 3 was junk. Clearly the writers are making stuff up as they go along, and that drives me nuts.</p>
<p>When I think of epic story, perfectively woven together from beginning to end, I think of JRR Tolkien. After reading the collection of original manuscripts and commentary by his son Christopher Tolkien, I was surprised that for the first half of Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien really didn&#8217;t know where he was going with it. It was chapter by chapter, and characters changed or story points were rewritten as he went along. But there came a point where I think the vision must have clicked for him, and at that point everything came together and the result was a work of fiction that will hold up for centuries.</p>
<p>The suspension of disbelief works on me better than many people. If I feel like the creator of a novel or film has a real vision I&#8217;ll overlook the small problems and fall in love with the story and characters. For Lost, the dialog and pacing of each episode is technically brilliant, but the overall vision is missing, and I don&#8217;t think it will resolve in any meaningful way. Instead, the ratings will slowly decline until the show disappears in the same pattern of X-Files or Alias before it.</p>
<p>So I may have to sign-off of Lost for a while. I did the same thing in the middle of season 2 when it got slow. Perhaps I&#8217;ll just read the synopsis and then join back in for the season finale every year. I&#8217;m afraid every time I watch it I&#8217;ll compare it to what it could have been, and only think of executives trying to milk the show for as many seasons as possible. I don&#8217;t want to be dragged along with them. Thanks anyway.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last month I tore down the rotting privacy fence in our backyard and built a new low spaced-picket fence. In addition to just being ugly to look at and nearly collapsed in a few places, the old fence was tall and prevented us from enjoying the space behind our house: essentially a private park owned by a local church but also accessible to the neighborhood.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/155794959"><img src="../images/2006/fence_small.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="new fence" border="1" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" /></a> It took me a week of part-time work and numerous Home Depot trips to build the new fence, which is about 60 feet across. I was able to salvage the strongest of the existing posts, cutting them off to match the new fence height. The ones that were rotten I removed and replaced by laying several new posts in concrete. I measured and cut each post so that the top of the fence line was level even though the ground slopped up slightly on one side of the yard.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very happy with the way it turned out. It opened the yard up even more than I was hoping for, and the better gate makes it easy to take a walk in the back. Another side effect I had not expected was encountering new people who routinely take their dogs for walks. Having a shorter fence is similar to parking your car in the driveway instead of your garage: you&#8217;ll see your neighbors more if you do.</p>
<p>Anyway, a very rewarding experience. After so much crafting code and pushing pixels, it&#8217;s nice to build something real and see the results. The &#8220;image on Flickr&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/155794959/ is one I took a few evenings ago and shows about half the full fence length.</p>
