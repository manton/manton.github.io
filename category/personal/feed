				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After blogging every day for a couple weeks at the end of July, I decided to take a break while my family and I took a vacation to London and Paris over the last 10 days. Instead we kept a private-ish travel blog of the trip. It&#8217;s similar to what I might post in a private journal (handwritten or <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a>), but accessible to family in a richer &#8220;own your own content&#8221; way than just Facebook photos.</p>
<p>I also posted 7 photos throughout the trip to <a href="https://instagram.com/manton">my Instagram account</a>. I like to use Instagram to capture just the very best photo from something, so the timeline never feels overloaded. Of course we took hundreds of photos overall. Some went to the trip blog, some went to Instagram and Facebook, some went to Snapchat (teenagers!), and the rest we&#8217;ll sort through as we have time. We had wi-fi in the apartments and so I made sure everything was synced up to Dropbox at least once a day.</p>
<p>I worked a little while traveling, but could only be so productive without getting in the way of enjoying the vacation. I&#8217;m catching up on some email and client work this morning. Feeling fairly rested despite a very long travel day coming back home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Am I always starting over<br />
In a brand new story?<br />
Am I always back at one<br />
After all I&#8217;ve done?&#8221;<br />
— <a href="https://itun.es/us/5MKtZ?i=860769901">Always Starting Over</a>, from the broadway show If/Then</em></p>
<p>Daniel said on the <a href="http://coreint.org/192">latest Core Intuition</a> that it’s important to celebrate major work milestones, like shipping a new app or quitting a job. I didn’t think I’d be celebrating right away, but as it turned out, my wife met me for lunch on Friday and we had a beer to mark the occasion. She snapped this photo:</p>
<p><center><a href="https://instagram.com/p/5z8rowxMfV/"><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/whole_foods_lunch_beer.jpg" width="400" height="400" border="0" /></a></center></p>
<p>Some things just work out. I couldn’t have picked a better t-shirt to wear if I had planned it.</p>
<p>When 5pm came around I made a final comment on Confluence, replied to a couple emails, and then signed out of HipChat. But I didn&#8217;t have time for much reflection. My son and I were busy packing up to head to a campout with Boy Scouts. Then as soon as we arrived back the next day, I turned around again to take my daughter to see <a href="http://idinamenzel.com/">Idina Menzel</a>.</p>
<p>The concert was incredible, somehow including both Wicked&#8217;s &#8220;Defying Gratify&#8221; and Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;Creep&#8221; — and yes, of course Frozen — to make a show with both the occasional explicit lyric <em>and</em>  little kids pulled up from the audience to sing. It was only while driving home from the concert that I had a moment to think what I need to do next. Idina&#8217;s lines from If/Then at the beginning of this post kept coming back to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked a long time on a few things, and they were pretty good, but now it&#8217;s time to start over. I turn 40 in a few months. It&#8217;s time to figure out what the next 10 years of my life should be about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week at <a href="http://twitter.com/nsdrinking">NSDrinking</a> we had one of our biggest turnouts yet. At one point, we’re talking about programming jobs, meetups, and Apple, and Jordan Breeding was mentioned. Not in the context of having passed away, but just in remembering something he had said or done. A stranger listening to the conversation would have no idea that Jordan wasn’t still a member of the community.</p>
<p>This struck me as exactly right. I think anyone would would want to be remembered as <em>who they were</em>, not how they left us.</p>
<p>Like many in our developer community, I&#8217;ve thought about Jordan Breeding at certain moments over the last couple months. <a href="http://www.patrickburleson.com/2015/02/09/remembering-jordan-breeding/">Patrick Burleson shared a story</a> about his close friend:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “For those that knew Jordan, they know that he was a incredibly generous and caring person. He did so many things for so many people, it’s a wonder he ever got anything else done.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ideveloper.co/podcast135/">Episode 135 of the iDeveloper podcast</a> opened with a segment remembering Jordan. Scotty and John did a great job of capturing what he meant to the community. Scotty says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Everybody has said really the same things about him. Firstly, how clever he was. He was an incredibly intelligent person. But secondly, how generous and humble he was with that intelligence, and how he shared with people. He always made you feel like you could be better, and do better, and was always having a laugh about things.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Guy English also dedicated <a href="http://www.imore.com/60-melton-ganatra-episode-iii-shipping-software">episode 60 of the Debug podcast</a> to Jordan. <a href="http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/514">On his blog</a> he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Good guy. I didn’t know him well but he always struck me as someone I’d like to get to know better. I lost out on that and too many others did too. Those who knew him universally loved him.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Kyle Richter worked with Jordan and <a href="http://kylerichter.com/jordan/">had this to say</a>, echoing Patrick’s quote above about how Jordan went out of his way for other people:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We were having dinner with some friends in California and my iPhone was acting up. Jordan volunteered to break away from the pack and come to the Apple Store with me. You rarely get to pick your last time with a friend, my last time with Jordan was him fighting with the Apple Store staff on my behalf. That was Jordan, even with everything he was going through he never thought of himself first.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://storify.com/gruber/jordan-breeding">a collection of tweets</a> via John Gruber. You know when reading any of these that Jordan will be remembered for a long time. He accomplished a great deal and went far, quickly, and that progress is a personal inspiration whenever I consider accelerating the change in my own career. Carpe diem.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>10 years ago, when everyone else had cable, we were sick of the monthly bill and the mindlessly infinite channel list and cancelled it. I was happy to never have to deal with Time Warner again. But a couple years ago, we subscribed again to keep up with some of our favorite shows. Finally <a href="http://www.techhive.com/article/2834118/hbo-shoots-back-at-netflix-with-plans-for-standalone-streaming-video-service.html">things are changing</a>, and I expect we&#8217;ll cancel again before too long.</p>
<p>This on-again, off-again relationship with cable is also how we treat having a second car. Working at home for the last 13 years, even with taking the kids to school and various errands, my wife and I rarely need to be in two places at once. So we downsized to one car long ago, then got a second car for a few years, then downsized again a couple years ago. With my daughters to high school, I knew we&#8217;d need another car soon, but it was nice not having an extra car payment and even better to have an excuse to bike to coffee shops.</p>
<p>I promised myself and my son, who is already living in the future, that our next car would be 100% electric. I kept up with new Tesla models and their growing <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/supercharger">Supercharger infrastructure</a>, but realistically Tesla is out of reach. There&#8217;s no way to justify the price for just driving to the elementary school a mile away, a nearby coffee shop, or around town every couple days.</p>
<p>So three weeks ago we picked up a <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/electric-cars/leaf/">Nissan Leaf</a>. Because our needs (and battery technology) keep changing, we&#8217;re leasing it and we&#8217;ll decide at the end whether to pay the difference and keep it. It&#8217;s a fun little car, so quiet and effortless to drive, and the kids love it.</p>
<p>Obviously our &#8220;normal&#8221; gas-powered car will remain the primary family car and the one that we take on road trips. The Leaf goes about 85 miles fully charged and plugs into the normal outlet in our garage, as if we were just plugging in Christmas lights. I&#8217;ve also used the charging stations at Whole Foods, where I usually go for coffee and work once or twice a week. (We skipped the recommended 240V home charging kit for now, which charges significantly faster. For comparison, Tesla&#8217;s range is closer to 250 miles.)</p>
<p>While I&#8217;ve always been pretty good at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy-efficient_driving">hypermiling</a>, the Leaf has made me even more conscious of it. I drove to my daughter&#8217;s basketball game in Georgetown last week, 30 miles away on the toll road. Sustaining 75mph is the worst and dragged my miles/kWh down a notch. On the way back, I drove the more direct, non-toll route and got significantly more efficiency at respectable speeds with some breaking.</p>
<p>But cruising down the highway it&#8217;s easy to see that this is the way the world should be, in time. Good new tech always reminds me of that first feeling we got when using the original iPhone, how it felt like the whole thing was from 5 years in the future. It&#8217;s not that extreme with the Leaf, but I still see a little of that, a glimpse that it&#8217;s more advanced than it should be. I think this may be the best car I&#8217;ve ever owned.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two great blog posts yesterday from Brent Simmons that I think are related, though I read one early in the day and the other catching up on RSS feeds late at night. First, <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/12/12/one_year_anniversary">on quitting his job</a> to work full-time on Vesper:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “A year ago I was a designer for an enterprise app I didn’t care about — or even like in the least tiny bit — and which you’ve never seen or heard of. That’s no way to live.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It reminds me, of course, of the famous Steve Jobs quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And then, <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/12/12/the_stream">Brent says about Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The 140-character stream is where things not worth saying, and not worth reading, thrive. It’s where things actually worth saying get over-simplified and then get lost, if they get said at all.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, do something you care about, write something lasting. The older I get, the more both of these resonate with me. And even though I haven’t posted to Twitter in over a year, I think I needed to read that post to focus back on this blog, where my writing should live.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I met Aaron briefly at SXSW, maybe 8 or 9 years ago, when the conference was still so small you could run into everyone. He wouldn’t remember me, but I followed his work and linked to him a couple times here. He was so young and already doing great things.</p>
<p><a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully">Lawrence Lessig</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “He was brilliant, and funny. A kid genius. A soul, a conscience, the source of a question I have asked myself a million times: What would Aaron think?”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2013/01/12/aaron_swartz">Brent Simmons</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “He’d gone on to do cool things — and make some mistakes, and get in trouble for them. But I knew he was extraordinary, and I expected him to grow up to become an American hero.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html">Cory Doctorow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and issues. I think he could have revolutionized American (and worldwide) politics. His legacy may still yet do so.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2013/01/12/aaron-swartz/">Daniel Jalkut</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “After witnessing a small extent of the struggles Aaron fought, I choose to commemorate him with gratitude for the many bad weeks when he resisted drastic action, and gave us all more time to appreciate and share his contributions.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>…<a href="http://twitter.com/danielpunkass/statuses/290318018901319680">and</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “You’ve honored Aaron Swartz by acknowledging what he did before he died. Now honor him by doing what he might have done.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Such a loss. For more links, <a href="http://watermark.io/collections/manton/aaronswartz1986-2013">I started a collection of tweets</a> when my timeline woke up to the news of Aaron’s death.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a &#8220;beautiful post by Craig Mod&#8221;:http://craigmod.com/satellite/nourishing_wake/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I pulled all of the poison out of the air &mdash; I drew it deep into my lungs and exhaled into my socks. My socks are full of the radiation, don&#8217;t touch the socks. I pulled the tsunami back. I drew the inland water back into the ocean. I pulled it over the rice paddies, unflattening them; the trees, straightening them &mdash; a billion billion leaves fluttering back into position. I drew the water back, back, back. It was easy because it was what I had to do, I tell her looking her straight in the eyes. Perhaps you don&#8217;t understand, but I had to.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Via Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/09/12/lanyrd, I&#8217;m loving &#8220;this blog and idea&#8221;:http://sparkabout.net/ from newlyweds Simon Willison and Natalie Downe, who are traveling the world on a working honeymoon:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been in Morocco now for just over a month. We launched Lanyrd from a rented apartment in Casablanca, and we&#8217;re writing this update from a Riad in Marrakech. So far, travelling and working on a startup have complemented each other surprisingly well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1999, Traci and I took a similar but shorter 2-month vacation to Europe where we both worked remotely. This was before wi-fi, so much of the destination planning centered around pay-by-the-hour internet cafes or reliable hotel phone lines for dial-up. Lots of backpacking, cheap rooms, and trains and boats between 6 countries. We were constantly broke and our accommodations varied between the crummy (freezing showers at a hostel) to the beautiful (freezing showers with a Mediterranean view), but those were easily some of the best weeks of my life. At the end of the trip we got engaged and came back to America to get married and have kids and never leave our neighborhood again.</p>
<p>Someday we&#8217;ll go back.</p>
