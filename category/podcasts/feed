				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://coreint.org/211">Today on Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I talk about my time at the tvOS Tech Talk and the recent executive changes at Apple. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Manton and Daniel discuss Apple TV development challenges, Apple’s executive team shakeup and its impact on the App Stores, and keeping a good attitude about successes and shortcomings as an ambitious indie developer.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>We wrap up the show with a conversation about taking risks and setting the right priorities for an indie business. Along the way I mention <a href="http://twitter.com/boltcity/status/6672228351">this tweet from Kazu Kibuishi</a>, which I misquoted slightly. Here&#8217;s the actual text:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;A professor once told me that &#8216;if you have a fallback, you will fall back.&#8217; I have found this to be true.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you enjoy the show, consider letting a friend know about it, or leaving a mini review on Twitter or iTunes. Thanks!</p>

<p>There were also a few new jobs posted to <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">jobs.coreint.org</a> yesterday. Check them out if you&#8217;re considering a change for 2016, or just curious what is out there for Objective-C and Swift jobs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we published <a href="http://coreint.org/206">episode 206 of Core Intuition</a>. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I really love how this episode turned out. It hits on several themes that have run through our show since the very first episode: a little tech news, some high-level coding talk, a bit of business analysis, and wrapped up with just how we <em>feel</em> right now about being indie developers. I hope you enjoy it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We posted <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/10/episode-202-juggling-more-than-ever/">episode 202 of Core Intuition</a> yesterday. This was a fun episode because we didn&#8217;t plan for it; we just started talking. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Manton and Daniel discuss the paralysis of choosing what to work on as an indie, Manton’s mysterious Kickstarter campaign, and the allure of company stickers and other marketing stuff.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Make sure to listen through the end for why I ordered <a href="https://twitter.com/riverfold/status/651509114284044288">stickers for my new app</a>. If you want one, you can <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">email me</a> or send us <a href="mailto:feedback@coreint.org">podcast feedback</a>.</p>
<p>As I said on the show, I highly recommend checking out <a href="http://www.relay.fm/tc">Thoroughly Considered</a>, the companion podcast for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/obi-a-smart-laser-toy-for-pets">Studio Neat&#8217;s Kickstarter project</a>. While you&#8217;re there, also consider backing the project, at the podcast level or the full Obi product if you have a pet that would love it. Even if it doesn&#8217;t successfully fund, I really enjoyed the first couple episodes of their podcast and hope it continues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/podcasting-microphones">Marco&#8217;s review of his favorite microphones</a> is comprehensive. You can&#8217;t go wrong by following his advice. I recorded my first podcast <a href="http://www.manton.org/2005/08/trains_podcast.html">10 years ago</a>, and Daniel and I are about to hit 200 episodes of <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, yet I still learned a few new things from reading Marco&#8217;s review.</p>
<p>As with most things, though, it&#8217;s a personal choice too. Take this part:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;If you’re just getting started with podcasting, a USB mic is good enough. If you’re established and looking to upgrade your production quality, or if you just love gear like me, you’ll likely find the jump to XLR worthwhile.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I did the opposite of this. For years I used an XLR mic along with a chain of two additional audio devices: the M-Audio FireWire Solo for getting the audio into the Mac, and the PreSonus TubePRE preamp for boosting the signal. This produced a nice sound and gave me knobs to fiddle with, but the extra complexity was just not worth it. I now use a simple USB mic and prefer it. (It&#8217;s the Rode Podcaster, which gets a mediocre endorsement in Marco&#8217;s review.)</p>
<p>This kind of &#8220;downgrading&#8221; is a common pattern with me and computers. I used to run a Mac Pro with 2 external Cinema Displays. Now I exclusively use a 13-inch retina MacBook Pro without a monitor.</p>
<p>In both cases — Macs and microphones — I find the trade-off worth it. If I want to work from a coffee shop, it&#8217;s the same resolution display, so I don&#8217;t need to change how I use Xcode. If I travel and need to record a podcast, it&#8217;s the same as if I was home, so I don&#8217;t need to risk messing up my audio settings. You give up some performance and flexibility, but in exchange you get the simplicity of having the same setup no matter where you are. And best of all: no more cables all over my desk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was interviewed for two podcasts recently. The first is <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/podcast/14">the CocoaConf Podcast</a>. Daniel Steinberg does a fantastic job of editing his show with a tight format, mixing together interviews and community news.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about my new microblogging project and working on things that matter. I told the story of shutting down my Mac app Wii Transfer to focus on other projects:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;It was really popular. I remember when I shipped 2.0 it was one of my best sales days ever, probably <em>the</em> best sales day ever. But what I came to is that as neat as it was, as useful as it was for some people, in the big scheme of things — if you take 5 years out, 10 years out — that app just wasn&#8217;t that important. It was neat, but it&#8217;s time had come and gone.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The other podcast I was on is a new one called <a href="http://consultpodcast.com/post/128140298572/episode-3-manton-reece-david-interviews-manton">Consult</a>. It&#8217;s an interview show all about consulting and client work. I had a good time chatting with host David Kopec about evolving Riverfold Software to <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/consulting/">include consulting</a> while at the same time expanding into a full-time indie business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.caseyliss.com/2015/8/17/a-year-of-relay-fm">Casey Liss summarizes</a> the excellent first year of new podcast network Relay FM:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Last year, I was deeply honored to be invited to be part of the launch shows on Relay. This year, I’m deeply honored to be a part of a network that not only airs some of the best spoken word programming on the internet, but also cares so deeply about being more inclusive.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to all the podcast hosts, and of course to Relay founders Myke Hurley and Stephen Hackett. <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/8/how-im-spending-my-indie-time">Stephen posted</a> about how his time as an indie is going:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The hours break down about how I felt they would break down, with Relay FM taking up about half my time and everything else going down from there. I suspect that consulting number will shrink as I wrap up some stuff for my former employer, but for now, I think this balance works. It&#8217;s a decent reflection of where my income is, which is encouraging.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Rewinding a few weeks, <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/8/whole-ass-one-thing">this is what he had to say</a> about the shift to indie work:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;It’s profoundly surreal, but incredibly freeing, to be focused on my writing and podcasting full-time. There’s still lots to work out with budgets and time management and extra things I could take on, but it’s all under the category of <em>my</em> work. That’s what makes it so much fun, despite the unknowns.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to watch the rise of podcast networks. It has now been a little over 5 years since I <a href="http://www.manton.org/2010/02/5_by_5.html">first wrote about the 5by5 launch</a>. Daniel and I will probably keep <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> independent forever, but I hope that the continued success of larger networks means that the overall podcast market is still growing.</p>
