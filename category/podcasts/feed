				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I published 2 new <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable</a> episodes this week, with a shared theme around Kickstarter projects. They&#8217;re both just 5-6 minutes long.</p>
<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/04/episode-19-kickstarter-recording/">Episode 19</a> is about how I finally sat down to record a video for my upcoming Kickstarter project. I still have editing to do, but I&#8217;m already feeling a lot better about actually launching this.</p>
<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/04/episode-20-kickstarter-rewards/">Episode 20</a> continues the discussion of Kickstarter, starting with my reaction after receiving the art book from <a href="http://blog.loish.net/">Loish</a> yesterday. I was really impressed with how well it was produced. Anytime I see something of such high quality I&#8217;m inspired to do a better job with my own work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I went to <a href="http://opencoffeeaustin.org/">Open Coffee Club</a> during SXSW week, I met several company founders and investors in Austin, and one was also an iOS developer. I usually do a poor job of promoting my own work in person, but I somehow managed to plug my <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition podcast</a>.</p>
<p>He hadn’t heard of the show before, and when he pulled it up to subscribe his comment was something like: “wow, you’ve been doing this for a long time”. It’s true. Daniel and I started the podcast in 2008. We only have 225 episodes, because we published episodes less frequently back in the old days, but I’ve always been proud of our consistency with the show format going back to the very beginning.</p>
<p>And it made me wonder: is there another Mac or iOS developer-focused tech podcast that has such a long history? Or really, many tech podcasts at all? The ones that come to mind are <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>, which started in 2007, and <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech">This Week in Tech</a>, which started in 2005.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another reminder to me that a big part of success is consistently showing up to work. If you&#8217;re always starting over, you can&#8217;t build on anything and take it further. The secret with the &#8220;version 2.0&#8221; of most apps isn&#8217;t that it has new features; it&#8217;s just that it exists at all.</p>
<p>In a couple months, just as WWDC is about to roll around, we’ll celebrate our 8th anniversary of recording Core Intuition. Our audience keeps growing, which is amazing, but there are still a lot of people who have never heard of the show. If you like what we&#8217;ve been doing, consider telling a friend, or posting a tweet or blog post about the show.</p>
<p>We expanded to 2 sponsors per episode this year because we wanted to grow the podcast — to commit more time and resources to both recording and to companion web sites like <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">the jobs site</a>. I think 2016 will be a great year and I&#8217;m happy that Core Intuition is a key part of helping me stay independent. Thanks for your support!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/03/episode-225-keep-your-eyes-open/">Episode 225 of Core Intuition</a> is out now. We talk about the new iPhone and iPad news from Monday’s Apple event, plus Swift. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Manton orders his dream phone, the iPhone SE. Daniel reflects on the growing allure of Swift, and the two discuss the risks of either adopting new technologies too soon, or holding on to the past for too long.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Also there&#8217;s this line from Daniel in the podcast that I like:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We have to be tuned into the future <em>and</em> tuned into the past to really do great work.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We pull in some history from Daniel&#8217;s time at Apple, and from our experience building Mac apps in the 1990s and early 2000s, and how it relates to the current Swift transition. Hope you enjoy it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We posted <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/03/episode-224-its-good-enough-for-cookie-monster/">episode 224 of Core Intuition today</a>. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Manton and Daniel discuss Apple’s revelation that Cookie Monster uses an iPhone, consider the Amazon Echo as the next big technology platform, and catch up with Manton’s successful 30 days of Austin coffee challenge.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I like this episode because it touches a little on tech industry and business themes that we weren&#8217;t planning to talk about, so it captures whatever our gut feelings were on those topics. And as we talk about at the end of the show, I did end up wrapping up the coffee shop visits today. I&#8217;ve updated <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">the coffee shop page on this site</a> with the final list.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  “Manton and Daniel talk about Apple’s current and future stock price, and their potential to branch out into other technologies such as virtual reality. They discuss Facebook’s shuttering of Parse and the implications for iOS developers and Facebook’s PR. Finally, they respond to listener Q&amp;A about getting up to speed on using and implementing your own web services.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Toward the end of the show, I also discuss my approach to password-less accounts for <a href="http://searchpath.io/">Searchpath</a> and my not-quite-released latest web app. While still far from perfect, I think getting away from passwords is an important next step for apps. Passwords are just too annoying for users to keep track of and enter, and a potential security issue and headache for system administrators.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I started a new short-form podcast called <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable</a>. Each episode is 3-5 minutes. It has been really fun to record the show because I can try new things without investing too much time.</p>
<p>One goal from the very beginning was to record from iOS so that I could easily record outside the house. I wanted not just the flexibility to be away from my computer, but a stereo microphone that could capture some of the surrounding environment, to give it a more informal feel. (I’m actually cheating in some cases and using multiple tracks, to make editing easier, but I think the effect works. All the episodes have been exported to mono so far, though.)</p>
<p>I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072DKYFO">this cheap iPhone microphone</a> for testing — only $10 when I ordered it! — and figured after some experiments with my iPhone 4S, I would invest in something new. I liked it enough that I’m still using the mic with my 5S via a Lightning cable adapter. I’m also using a foam pop filter that I already had from a previous old mic.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2016/microphone_with_filter.jpg" width="550" height="244" alt="Microphone" border="0" /></center></p>
<p>This may be the single best value in a tech gadget I’ve ever purchased. Total cost for producing the podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072DKYFO">Microphone</a>: $10</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8">Ferrite</a>: $20</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8">Workflow</a>: $3 (for MP3 conversion)</li>
<li>Domain name: $120 (.fm domains are expensive)</li>
</ul>
<p>I certainly didn’t invent the idea of a “microcast”. There are other good short podcasts, such as <a href="http://bitesize.tech/">Bite Size Tech</a>. But I’m happy to see even more people trying out the idea. <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/">Michael</a> even started a new podcast called <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/microcast/">Driftwood</a> to chronicle the development of <a href="https://github.com/LK64076007A/driftwood">his Jekyll template</a> for microcasts.</p>
<p>Ferrite also continues to impress. It’s a very high quality iOS app and is competitive with Mac multi-track audio editors. For a good introduction, check out <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/">Jason Snell’s review</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On <a href="http://coreint.org/215">this week&#8217;s Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I start with a recap of Daniel&#8217;s time at the tvOS Tech Talk in New York City. More from the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Daniel and Manton reflect on their experience at the Apple TV tech talks, brainstorm app category ideas for Apple TV, and discuss the use of Twitter for customer support and how a 10K text limit might impact that. They also talk about Apple’s iOS 9.3 preview, rumors of a new iPhone 4-inch model, and speculate whether WWDC would ever move from Moscone in SF.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not too early to start planning for WWDC. Hotel pricing is a major issue this year, and I have a feeling people will be more scattered around the city than usual.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just published <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/01/episode-5-mailing-stickers/">episode 5</a> of my new short-format podcast, Timetable. I&#8217;m having a <em>lot</em> of fun with this. Producing an episode that&#8217;s only 5 minutes long means I can experiment without investing too much time.</p>
<p>As I was listening to some other podcasts this week talk about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/twitters-10k-limit.html">the Twitter news</a>, it occurred to me how important it is to have a good mix of podcasts, just as it is with blogging. Many of the most popular Apple-related podcasts hit the same news stories each week and have nearly the same opinion. Don&#8217;t get me wrong; I listen to a bunch of them and they&#8217;re great. But it&#8217;s a reminder to me that for Timetable, and especially for <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, not to be afraid of having a more contrarian role when it&#8217;s appropriate.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing controversial in the latest episode of <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/">Timetable</a>, though. Just me talking about getting some stamps to finally send out <a href="https://twitter.com/riverfold/status/651509114284044288">stickers</a>.</p>
