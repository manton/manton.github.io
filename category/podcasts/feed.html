				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We published <a href="http://coreint.org/262">episode 262 of Core Intuition</a> today. It&#8217;s December already, so we&#8217;ve inevitably been thinking about unfinished projects as the year wraps up. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Daniel and Manton talk about coping with disappointment of failing to achieve goals in an expected length of time, recognize the differing demands of building software for different markets, and talk about tricks for managing lack of enthusiasm for finishing projects. Finally, they answer a listener question about how to get started with consulting, and planning for maintaining a suitable income when you “quit your day job.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks as always for listening to the show.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we published <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/11/episode-260-invitation-to-failure/">episode 260</a> of Core Intuition. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Daniel and Manton discuss Sal Soghoian’s sudden departure from Apple, and what it may mean for Apple’s future ambitions with automation. Then they react to Apple’s alleged decision to abandon their line of AirPort branded routers, and bemoan the loss of yet another “just buy the Apple one” peripheral option
</p></blockquote>
<p>I liked the topics for our show this week because it allowed us to not just talk about AppleScript as it exists today, but also to reflect on what life developing scriptable apps was like in the early days of AppleScript. It&#8217;s always fun to think back on 1990s Mac development.</p>
<p>Many of our listeners are celebrating Thanksgiving today. To all of our listeners, whether you&#8217;ve listened since the beginning in 2008 or just recently discovered the podcast, thank you so much for giving our show a chance and for being part of the community. Daniel and I still feel incredibly lucky that we get to chat every week about Apple news and our work as indie developers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I published a <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/11/episode-27-something-was-missing/">new episode of Timetable</a>. It&#8217;s about Apple&#8217;s new design book but also about how social networks are broken, with a hint of what I think we can do about it. It&#8217;s just 3 and a half minutes long.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/10/apple-apologists.html">I&#8217;ve written about before</a>, Apple no longer needs us to defend the company. On the other hand, many good people work on Apple&#8217;s products and so criticizing the company can easily come across as criticizing those people. That&#8217;s not my intention, but I sometimes get that balance wrong.</p>
<p>I own dozens and dozens of art books, but I won&#8217;t be ordering this new Apple design book. It looks overconfident instead of nostalgic. It looks like it celebrates objects instead of people. It looks like a beautiful book for the wrong time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, Daniel and I recorded and published <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/10/episode-254-it-blew-up-in-this-case/">episode 254 of Core Intuition</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Daniel and Manton dive into Apple’s controversial suspension of Dash developer Kapeli’s App Store account, and respond to listener Q&amp;A about whether non-sandboxed apps are at risk of removal from the Mac App Store.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Covering sensitive subjects like Kapeli&#8217;a suspension is difficult in a podcast format where you can&#8217;t perfectly prepare your thoughts. Did I go too far defending Bogdan Popescu? Did I not go far enough?</p>
<p>Maybe we&#8217;ll know with some distance from this topic whether we reacted fairly. But I don&#8217;t think I overstated how important a moment this was for the App Store — both <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/10/kapelis-reputation.html">Apple&#8217;s influence</a> over the narrative and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/10/kapelis-suspension-is-a-test-for-apple.html">as a test</a> for their power in the store. Unfortunately the story still has a very unsatisfying ending.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We posted <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/10/episode-253-great-to-have-an-excuse/">Core Intuition episode 253</a> this morning. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Manton and Daniel discuss Manton&#8217;s experience at the Release Notes conference, talk about the rationale for supporting what might be considered edge-case behaviors in apps, and dig deeper into questions of freemium pricing, reflecting on the Omni Group&#8217;s pertinent announcements. Finally they talk briefly about Google&#8217;s latest announcements and what their competition means to Apple.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Google must be doing something right with their announcements, because yesterday my son told me he wants to get a Pixel when it&#8217;s time to replace his iPhone 5S. And as much as I love our Amazon Echo, I can see Google Home taking off if it&#8217;s well-integrated with existing Google services.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://coreint.org/248">This week on Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I talked about recent Apple news:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Daniel and Manton react to the European Union’s €13B retroactive tax demand to Apple, talk about the impact of tax laws on indies and small companies, and weigh in on Apple’s purported AI and machine learning triumphs. Finally they catch up on their ambitions to be more productive as the busy summer transitions to fall.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I wondered whether Apple is so obsessed with privacy that they are blinded to what is possible with more computation and extensibility in the cloud. I judge their efforts not only by the remarkable work the Siri team has done, and by what Google and Amazon are building, but also by Apple&#8217;s own gold standard: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRH8eimU_20">Knowledge Navigator video</a> from 1987. That vision is too ambitious for one company to develop all the pieces for. We eventually need <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/05/wanting-an-open-voice-assistant-platform.html">a more open Siri platform</a> to get us there.</p>

<p>So I was happy to see <a href="http://supertop.co/">Supertop</a> start a podcast recently to talk about the Castro 2 launch and other thoughts on being a 2-person indie shop. <a href="https://castro.fm/episode/HaPv6C">Episode 3</a> features Brent Simmons:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Pádraig and Oisín are joined by Brent Simmons to discuss indie app development in the wake of Vesper shutting down.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One subject I&#8217;m glad they touched on is the special challenge for a company that needs to support multiple salaries, but isn&#8217;t big enough yet to actually have significant revenue like a large company. <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/08/episode-247-maybe-there-is-hope/">Last week</a>, Daniel and I talked about the balance of loving being independent but also knowing that one day you want to expand to support a small team.

<p>Believe it or not, I was kind of holding back a little in my Swift ranting. But it was the most critical I&#8217;ve been on the show. And it&#8217;s totally okay for you to disagree! Maybe even <em>good for the platform</em> if you do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m back from San Francisco, catching up on everything I missed while traveling. I recorded a few podcast episodes during WWDC week, both my own and an interview.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/06/episode-237-wwdc-2016/">On Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I talked right after the keynote about the morning&#8217;s announcements. From the show notes:</p>

<p>In the middle of the week, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-907896436/motiv-manton-normalized">I talked with John Voorhees of MacStories</a> about WWDC news but also a lot about microblogging. It may be the most I&#8217;ve shared about my latest project, all in one place.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I recorded a <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/06/episode-24-san-francisco-reset/">short episode of Timetable</a>. I wanted to capture what the trip to San Francisco each year means to me, outside of the conference itself. I find the week a good opportunity to reset and think about where my focus should be across my projects.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We published <a href="http://coreint.org/236">Core Intuition episode 236</a> today, discussing the recent App Store announcements and a listener question about offices. We wrap up with plans for WWDC.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of great blog posts and podcast episodes already on the App Store subscription change. I listened to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/31">Under the Radar 31</a> and the <a href="https://releasenotes.tv/special-episode-mostly-neutral-ish/">Release Notes special edition</a> today and recommend both. The most confusion seems to be around what kind of apps are appropriate for subscriptions, where by “appropriate” I mean “what Apple will approve”.</p>
<p>John Gruber also <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/06/app_store_subscription_uncertainty">follows up at Daring Fireball</a> on this question:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Professional apps that require “a lot of maintenance of new features and versions” don’t fit either of those categories. <em>Would</em> Twitter clients like Tweetbot and Twitterrific qualify for subscription pricing? After talking to Schiller yesterday, I thought so. Now, I don’t know.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I mention on Core Intuition, apps that have a backend service with obvious hosting and maintenance costs — a music streaming service, an invoicing web app, or a blogging platform, for example — are easier for users to understand as needing to be subscriptions. Twitter apps are an interesting example because <em>some</em> are pure clients to Twitter’s backend, but many increasingly have their own app-specific services like timeline syncing or push notifications.</p>
<p>For years Apple has allowed apps to use auto-renewing subscriptions. I had an iPhone app and companion web service that was approved by Apple for auto-renewing subscriptions, after I made the case for the service as a “cloud” archive. From section 11.15 of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store review guidelines</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Apps may only use auto-renewing subscriptions for periodicals (newspapers, magazines), business Apps (enterprise, productivity, professional creative, cloud storage), and media Apps (video, audio, voice), or the App will be rejected
</p></blockquote>
<p>From my experience and listening to other developers, I’ve had the impression for a while that Apple would essentially reject most auto-renewing app submissions by default. While we still don’t know what “all categories” means in the new announcement, I expect it means that there will no longer be a kind of blanket rejection. Apple will still reject many apps as poorly suited for subscriptions, though, and maybe that&#8217;s okay for now.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m conflicted on this point. John Gruber&#8217;s suggestion to approve everything and let the market decide is compelling and fits better with my instinct that the control should be in developers&#8217; hands.)</p>
<p>“Subscription fatigue” is a real thing that I’ll occasionally hear from customers about. No one wants to pay $1/month to 40 different apps and services; it feels like a burden in a way that paying the same total price to just two apps at $20/month does not. Nevertheless, subscriptions are very powerful. Everything I’ve done over the last few years is to position myself to eventually have a recurring-revenue success.</p>
