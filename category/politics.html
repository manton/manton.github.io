			<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/opinion/paul-krugman-hooray-for-the-aca.html">Writing his op-ed for the New York Times</a>, Paul Krugman reacts to just before and after the Supreme Court upheld a crucial part of the Affordable Care Act:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Was I on the edge of my seat, waiting for the Supreme Court decision on Obamacare subsidies? No — I was pacing the room, too nervous to sit, worried that the court would use one sloppily worded sentence to deprive millions of health insurance, condemn tens of thousands to financial ruin, and send thousands to premature death.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He continues by countering many original arguments against the law, from not insuring enough people to costing too much. He wraps up with:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Put all these things together, and what you have is a portrait of policy triumph — a law that, despite everything its opponents have done to undermine it, is achieving its goals, <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/3/9/8175277/obamacare-cost-subsidies-budget">costing less than expected</a>, and making the lives of millions of Americans better and more secure.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And that’s <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/politics/supreme-court-affirms-right-to-gay-marriage-122495807066.html">not the only big news</a> from the Supreme Court. Nice way to end the week.</p>

			<p>In the software world, the best strategy is to ship early and often. Get something out there that solves a real problem, then fill in the missing pieces and continue to improve it. Iterate. In politics, though, we often only have one chance in years or decades to get it right.</p>
<p>The healthcare bill passed the Senate and is on its way to becoming real, even if it&#8217;s a shadow of what it could have been. We should be thankful that we got anything &mdash; the changes <em>do</em> matter &mdash; but at the same time I can&#8217;t help thinking it was a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>Who&#8217;s to blame? I wish Democrats had fought harder; I wish they&#8217;d framed the debate correctly from the start. I still like George Lakoff&#8217;s focus on calling the public option the &#8220;American Plan&#8221;:http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/8/20/769743/-The-PolicySpeak-Disaster-for-Health-Care, but I also like &#8220;John Neffinger&#8217;s point&#8221;:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-neffinger/how-we-lost-healthcare_b_392275.html that maybe the real mistake was in not starting with a single-payer plan so that the public option would look like a moderate compromise. It feels like many Democrats were resigned to failure early on.</p>
<p>In an &#8220;unrelated tweet a few weeks ago&#8221;:http://twitter.com/boltcity/status/6672228351, from comic artist Kazu Kibuishi: &#8220;If you have a fallback, you will fall back.&#8221; My failures reflect that too. To shoot for greatness you have to put everything you&#8217;ve got into your first effort.</p>
<p>I keep coming back to something Hillary Clinton said in a debate with Obama early in the Democratic primaries of 2008. It struck me as so true at the time that I wrote it down:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you do not have a plan that starts out attempting to achieve universal healthcare, you will be nibbled to death.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And that&#8217;s what happened.</p>

			<p><i>I made a comment on &#8220;Dave Winer&#8217;s points&#8221;:http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/08/29/initialThoughtsOnThePalinN.html about McCain VP pick Sarah Palin that I feel like I should republish here. I&#8217;ve commented on dozens of blogs and news sites through the primaries, but I haven&#8217;t posted here on this blog, instead preferring to let off steam on Twitter. I think this comment serves as a nice snapshot in time of the race, at least from my perspective, so here it is:</i></p>
<p>Some of your points may end up being true, but let me just address number 6. Since you didn&#8217;t vote for Hillary, there are 18 million people who know more about this point than you do.</p>
<p>Every day this week at the convention, the main news story was Hillary and party unity. What would she say, would Democrats unite? Well she hit it out of the park with her speech, and Bill Clinton did too, and then Biden followed strong and it was easy to be excited about being a Democrat, about the story of Obama and Biden and how hopelessly lost the Republicans were by comparison. Even those Democrats who were frustrated with the party, and disappointed with Obama in general, started to warm up to the ticket.</p>
<p>When McCain picked Palin, it was like none of the week had happened. Everything was reset back to the primaries, in how Hillary had been treated by the press, party, and Obama supporters, and how Obama had passed her over for VP.</p>
<p>On the issues, Palin is no Hillary. But every day for the next 2 months, Palin will be a reminder to disgruntled Democrats that Obama messed up.</p>

			<p>After Hillary won Ohio, Texas, and Rhode Island last month, I decided it was time to think less about actively supporting my own candidate, who clearly wasn&#8217;t going away, and more about the future of the Democratic Party and what it would take to come together when a nominee is chosen. I had been quick to defend Hillary on Twitter and in blog comments, but the more I considered the close race and the long month until the next primary in Pennsylvania, now finally here, the more convinced I became that a joint ticket is the answer to a unified party.</p>
<p>Rather than bicker with my friends who support Obama, I changed my tone to emphasize our shared values and launched a new site: &#8220;unitetheparty.com&#8221;:http://www.unitetheparty.com/. I&#8217;ve been posting there regularly since March, and hope to build a group of like-minded Democrats to write on this topic, as well as a list of supporters who want to see a joint ticket happen.</p>
<p>Thinking about the endgame of the race in this context provides an excellent backdrop for discussing the real issues important to voters. There&#8217;s still an opportunity to use these campaigns for good: setting the right tone against McCain and bringing awareness of the Democratic agenda to everyone.</p>

			<p>Need something to listen to on your iPod while waiting in line to vote today? Try out these fantastic recent episodes of two of my favorite podcasts for animators and animation fans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spline Cast with Ed Catmull&#8221;:http://splinedoctors.blogspot.com/2007/11/original-spline-doctor.html. I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;ve followed the careers of John Lasseter and Steve Jobs a lot closer than I have for Ed Catmull, but this podcast shows pretty clearly the depth of impact Ed Catmull has had on the computer industry and the Pixar culture. It&#8217;s a great listen not just for anyone who cares about animation, but also for entrepreneurs who want a look into how you stay successful year after year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Animation Podcast with James Baxter&#8221;:http://animationpodcast.com/archives/2008/02/04/james-baxter-part-one/. There are many great animators, from well known independents who receive Oscar recognition to those who work 12-hour days in relative obscurity at a big studio, but there are only a handful of true masters of the art form. Baxter is one of my favorites. The powerful sequence with Moses and the burning bush and the mannerism of Belle fixing her hair were both always really memorable for me.</p>
<p>Enjoy! Happy Super Tuesday.</p>

			<p>Obama is passionate, thoughtful, centrist enough for broad appeal, and a brilliant speaker. If he&#8217;s the nominee I&#8217;ll support him fully with every bit of strength I have. There is something special about him, and it comes around rarely in a candidate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave Winer wrote&#8221;:http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/01/08/gluedToTheTv.html: &#8220;Obama, like Carter in 1976, may be our pennance for having re-elected Bush in 2004. We&#8217;re taking the medicine we deserve for having been crazy enough to re-elect someone who was so bad for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what about Hillary? She&#8217;s part of the establishment, and I volunteered heavily for the Howard Dean campaign. Could I support someone as traditional as Hillary? As &#8220;Mike Cohen said&#8221;:http://mcdevzone.com/2008/01/08/bad-news-from-new-hampshire: &#8220;I oppose her very strongly, not only because of all the baggage she brings, but for her anti-progressive record.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I posted to Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/578006692 on election night that something had changed between the Iowa vote and New Hampshire: Hillary had found her voice, and it surprised me. Turns out she knows what is at stake. I always knew she was a fighter; after 2000 and 2004, we need the Democrats to show some backbone again. But I think she&#8217;s been underestimated even more deeply than that, in her ability to speak to the core Democratic base while drawing upon her new experience and record in the Senate that most people aren&#8217;t familiar with yet.</p>
<p>And then there is the woman factor. Some people will say this matters but they don&#8217;t really understand unless they have daughters of their own, daughters who will grow up and become teenagers, the defining moment of their lives, during a woman presidency. This is both personal and huge and it could spread like wildfire. For me, it tips the balance.</p>
<p>My family is throwing its support &mdash; our money for donations, our phones for getting out the vote, and our voice &mdash; behind Hillary. Thank you New Hampshire for making this a real primary election again.</p>

			<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a politically-themed post. Probably the only one before 2008, so don&#8217;t run away just yet.</p>
<p>The Bush veto of the bipartisan children&#8217;s health care plan a few weeks ago really made me angry, but it wasn&#8217;t until &#8220;Justin Miller responded&#8221;:http://twitter.com/incanus77/statuses/310113392 to &#8220;my tweet&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/310110182 that I started to think about why. Here&#8217;s the reason.</p>
<p>When Bush was elected in 2000, I expected this kind of stuff from him. Vetoing stem cell research? Killing children&#8217;s health care funding? Sure, par for the course for this Republican. But then 9-11 happened and everything changed. The war. Our president&#8217;s priorities changed.</p>
<p>Bush got a free ride from the media during the 2000 election, and again after 9-11. He would make the most incompetent and clumsy mistakes and yet be cut slack because, frankly, expectations are just so much lower for him than any other president in recent history.</p>
<p>At some point in 2004, opinion started to shift, led by folks like Howard Dean (who I&#8217;ve &#8220;written about before&#8221;:http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amanton.org+howard+dean). Eventually, after Bush won re-election, there would be enough anti-war momentum to matter. And that brings us up to now and this veto.</p>
<p>Everyone is focused on the war. Everyone understands the significance, the mistakes. Most of the country wants it over but we know that it&#8217;s complex, and the consequences for any given action will be felt for a decade. Compared to the lives lost in Iraq and the harm done to the stability of the Middle East, the rise of a new generation of terrorists &#8212; what does a health care bill matter? Is it worth fighting for?</p>
<p>Democrats in power by a slim majority probably think they have to choose their battles, have to give in on some issues so they can hold on to the important ones, like the war. But I say no. The only thing that works against this stubborn ass in the White House is to take the fight to him. Cut him off at every turn. Don&#8217;t give him a freakin&#8217; inch. Call for an override vote again and again.</p>
<p>Every. Single. Day.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how you win. You put people on the ground in every state &#8212; organizing, protesting, getting out the vote. You put letters in the hands of our representatives &#8212; email, blogs, editorial, flyers. You put a loud voice to what you feel and never, ever back down.</p>

			<p>I started writing this post yesterday afternoon. Worried that I would jinx a victory, I wrote two versions: one for a narrow loss and one for what really happened.</p>
<p>Two years ago, after Kerry lost, &#8220;I wrote&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2004/11/after_almost_winning.html: &#8220;We almost won, and all the hard work of the last 18 months will pay off big in two short years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s two years later, and we did it. DNC chairman Howard Dean&#8217;s &#8220;50-state strategy&#8221;:http://democrats.org/a/party/a_50_state_strategy/ worked. The media will tell you that the election was just about Iraq and Bush, but it goes deeper than that &#8212; voters are sick of Republican corruption, tired of half-hearted attempts at health care, and longing for a real vision for public education. You can see the patterns by looking at the progressive wins in state races and on local propositions too.</p>
<p>There are &#8220;20 posts in the politics category&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/category/politics.html of my blog, and they include some of my favorites from the last 4 years. It&#8217;s nice to be on the winning side again after too long. The next part of the job is for Democrats to show everyone in America that real progress can be made in Washington. Deliver. Then keep organizing and make it all happen again in 2008.</p>

			<p>I voted today. Here&#8217;s the scene for my precinct today. Not too crowded, but a steady flow of people.</p>
<p><center><img src="../images/2006/voting.jpg" alt="Voting" width="400" height="195" border="0" style="border: 1px solid gray" /></center></p>
<p>Yesterday Traci and I called voters as part of &#8220;MoveOn.org&#8217;s Call for Change&#8221;:http://www.moveon.org/. I&#8217;m always nervous about calling complete strangers. I did this for the first time for Howard Dean&#8217;s campaign and it&#8217;s easy to get disillusioned with answering machines and hang-ups. But almost everyone we talked to was planning to vote today, and I think there&#8217;s definitely a sense that <em>this election matters</em>. Sometimes a simple reminder is the difference between voting or skipping it, so if you only reach a handful of people it can make the difference in a close race if thousands of other people are doing the same.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be up late tonight watching the returns. Polls close early in some places and may get crowded, so don&#8217;t wait any longer if you haven&#8217;t voted yet. For location info call 1-866-MY-VOTE-1.</p>

			<p>I couldn&#8217;t let the 5th anniversary of September 11th pass without saying something. On Friday &#8220;the Senate intelligence committee released a report&#8221;:http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/washington/09intelcnd.html showing that there was no link between Saddam Hussein and 9/11. That isn&#8217;t news. What is news is the details: that Saddam actually <em>distrusted</em> Al Qaeda and tried to <em>capture</em> Zarqawi. The simple truth is that terrorist organizations are a threat to any government, even ones we have disagreements with.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#8217;t make you sick, here&#8217;s another one that I haven&#8217;t heard mentioned yet. Sometime next year the number of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq will <em>surpass the civilian deaths on September 11th</em>. (September 11th = 2973, Iraq as of today = 2661)</p>
<p>The level of incompetence in our President, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and their advisors reaches new heights. What can we do? Five years ago we were uneducated and scared, and even two years later we could easily be led by fear alone. Now, just stay angry. Change starts in November.</p>

			<p>Thursday is the presidential inauguration, as well as <a href="http://www.notonedamndimeday.com/">Not One Damn Dime Day</a>. Every year or so you hear about one of these attempts to effect the economy, and of course they usually have no noticeable effect. But you never know &mdash; one day one of these virtual protests will catch fire.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On &lsquo;Not One Damn Dime Day&rsquo; those who oppose what is happening in our name in Iraq can speak up with a 24-hour national boycott of all forms of consumer spending.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, I&rsquo;m almost at the point where I can listen to the news again. For years I&rsquo;ve listened to NPR every day, the Sunday talk shows, and frequently Nightline or (when I had cable) The Daily Show at night. But after the election I shut down everything except weblogs. It was just too painful to listen to the media.</p>
<p>Howard Dean is receiving strong support in <a href="http://www.blogforamerica.com/archives/005781.html">his run for DNC chair</a>. It shouldn&rsquo;t surprise anyone who read what I wrote during the Democratic primaries last year that I support him 100%. Hopefully there will be a way to help &mdash; it doesn&rsquo;t have the same grassroots feel as a presidential run because there are so few people who will vote.</p>

			<p><img src="../images/2004/redstate.gif" border="0" height="135" width="136" alt="red state" align="right" /> See that little blue county in the expanse of red in the image on the right? That&#8217;s where I live.</p>
<p><a href="../2004/01/deans_comeback.html">Back in January</a>, I said: &#8220;It&#8217;s about bringing more people into the process. But to do that right, we need a candidate who can speak passionately to the issues and inspire voters.&#8221; Kerry ran a good campaign, but I can&#8217;t help thinking that something was missing in both the man and the message.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/11/3/111118/941">Kos is calling on Dean to replace McAuliffe</a> as head of the DNC. It&#8217;s time for the Democratic party to get back on the offensive. The last two years have been about building the groundwork for future wins &#8212; the internet infrastructure, the radio, the organization. It&#8217;s not there yet but it will be in 2006. All that&#8217;s left is to pick quality opposition candidates and to absolutely stop letting Republican&#8217;s frame every issue on their own terms.</p>
<p>One of the things that really bugs me is when Republican candidates run unopposed. This year, thanks to redistricting, our congressional district went from being all of Austin to a tiny strip of rural counties stretching from my neighborhood to Houston. The district was designed for a Republican win, and the Democratic party didn&#8217;t bother to challenge it until Lorenzo Sadun signed up as a write-in candidate.</p>
<p>There was no chance to win as a write-in, but he received 12% of the vote! 11000 people took the time to spell his name correctly because they wanted to send a message. And in the Houston suburbs, Richard Morrison came within 10 points of beating Tom DeLay, the closest contest DeLay has ever faced.</p>
<p>The truth is, we almost won. We almost unseated a war-time president who had 90% approval ratings after 9/11. We almost beat a party that used fear (terrorism and gay marriage) to get people into the voting booth.</p>
<p>We almost won, and all the hard work of the last 18 months will pay off big in two short years.</p>

			<p>Based on the exit poll numbers and the supposedly record turnout, I fully expected that we&#8217;d know within a couple hours after polls closed that Kerry was the decisive winner. I was bewildered when Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin still weren&#8217;t called, so I went to bed.</p>
<p>I woke up off and on in the middle of the night, dreaming that I was browsing news web sites. At 5am I couldn&#8217;t stand it any longer and got out of bed for good, and now I&#8217;ve been deciphering what happened since last night.</p>
<p>The turnout was up, but even the current numbers seem low considering all the people who waited several hours in line to vote. And where was the young vote? I wasn&#8217;t the only one to <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6390335/">predict they&#8217;d make the difference</a>. Is the Republican get-out-the-vote effort just that much better?</p>
<p>Once again, the networks (specifically NBC and Fox) called states too soon. By giving Ohio to Bush, they were left in the sticky 269 situation, not daring to give any more states (like Nevada) to him lest they completely undermine the vote counting process. The networks promised more transparency in how they project a winner, but I didn&#8217;t see it.</p>

There was already a line of people (perhaps 50) stretching outside. It was cold, from the front that came in yesterday, but it didn&#8217;t seem to bother anyone too much.

			<p>In the 2000 presidential election, Gore was behind in all the national polls before election day. I remember that night, listening to the radio in a fast food drive-in lane when NPR called Pennsylvania for Gore. I cheered to no one in particular, because it was the first confirmation that Gore could win.</p>
<p>If you believe the polls today, Bush has a few point lead, and the election will be decided in a handful of battleground states. I no longer believe the polls, except as an indicator for overall trends. Kerry will win by a solid margin. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
<p><b><i>Youth</i></b></p>
<p>Last Monday morning I was in the Austin airport waiting to catch a flight, watching the local news. They were covering University of Texas students who had stayed up all night outside the early voting location on campus to vote. They were all Kerry supporters.</p>
<p>Now, a week later, the local news is reporting some numbers from UT. There are <i>three times</i> the number of early voters on campus compared to 2000. For the most part these voters are not even included in polls because they all use cell phones as their primary number.</p>
<p><b><i>Republicans</i></b></p>
<p>It takes a lot to abandon years of straight-party voting, but it&rsquo;s happening this year. Sometimes it takes enormous respect for the candidate (such as Democrats who could easily vote for John McCain). This year it&rsquo;s the opposite: Republicans are baffled by Bush&rsquo;s misjudgments in war and his abandonment of fiscal conservatism.</p>
<p>Also see: <a href="http://www.errolmorris.com/html/election04/election04_main.html">Republican switcher ads</a></p>
<p><b><i>The undecided</i></b></p>
<p>Apparently there is a large percentage of voters who are just confused about how politics work in this country. Personality means more to them than terms like liberal and conservative. Instead, there are usually a few key issues that turn these voters to any one candidate. Two of those issues this year are the economy (lean to Kerry) and fear (lean to Bush).</p>
<p>The debates help people choose, and Kerry outperformed Bush in all three. Kerry wasn&rsquo;t totally immune to criticism, though. The flip-flop nonsense tends to stick because there is a little bit of truth to it (ignoring for the moment that Bush has more than his fair share of major policy reversals). <a href="http://mathewgross.com/blog/archives/000686.html">Mathew Gross pointed</a> to a &lt;a href=&#8221;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101041004-702123,00.html</p>
<p>&#8220;>Time Magazine article</a> second-guessing the outcome in the Democratic primaries:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Democratic voters should stick to their day jobs. With just five weeks until Election Day, there&rsquo;s reason to believe they guessed wrong &mdash; that Dean would be doing better against Bush than Kerry is.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the scream, I still believe that Dean would have been a strong candidate. He distinguished himself from the other candidates by a real desire to effect change: even today, he is a powerful force for local and state-level candidates. He showed the Democrats how to win when they had lost their voice.</p>
<p>So there you have it. My prediction: Kerry by 3 percent nationally, with important wins in Florida, Colorado, and Pennsylvania giving him the electoral college. Record numbers of young voters.</p>

			<p>The death of Christopher Reeve will hit a lot of people pretty hard. He worked with so much determination to regain movement and he stayed optimistic. It&#8217;s an inspirational story, and it&#8217;s a shock that the story is now over. As my wife said, &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t supposed to die.&#8221; He vowed to walk again, and we believed it.</p>
<p>In the second presidential debate last week, Kerry brought up Reeve as an example of who we can help and why stem cell research could be so important. Here&#8217;s the quote, from the <a href="http://debates.org/pages/trans2004c.html">official debate transcript</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You know, I was at a forum with Michael J. Fox the other day in New Hampshire, who&#8217;s suffering from Parkinson&#8217;s, and he wants us to do stem cell, embryonic stem cell. And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering. His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he said to me and to the whole hall, he said, &#8216;You know, don&#8217;t take away my hope, because my hope is what keeps me going.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chris Reeve is a friend of mine. Chris Reeve exercises every single day to keep those muscles alive for the day when he believes he can walk again, and I want him to walk again.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nancy Reagan, Ron Reagan, Michael J. Fox, and Christopher Reeve have done a lot of good as activists, because they are respected and admired by the public. But there are thousands more who are not well-known, and those people are equally worth fighting for.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s appropriate that Christopher Reeve, the man forever known as Superman, would fight so hard to overcome the limitations of his crippled, human body. Superman is an icon, not just an old comic. The idea speaks to a generation of kids who dream to be something more, and it&#8217;s the reason that that memorable scene in Iron Giant can bring an adult to tears.</p>

			<p>One of the things I like about SXSW is that it&#8217;s a time to just think about new ideas without necessarily trying to relate them directly to a particular work project. When I take notes, I write down interesting quotes or concepts that the speakers are presenting, but I also intersperse my own opinions. It&#8217;s important to capture ideas at the time they spark, and today there were enough to fill a book. Instead of summarizing the day I will take some of the themes and work through them in later posts this week.</p>
<p>I should at least note that it was great to hear Joe Trippi speak, though. <a href="http://www.irelan.net/becoming/archives/000995.shtml">Ryan posted some photos</a> from that session and the MoveOn.org keynote.</p>

			<p>Today marks the two year anniversary of this weblog. It&#8217;s been a good experience, and even if the content is not always fresh it&#8217;s still a worthwhile endeavor and will continue. Expect the posts to ramp up to at least one a day through SXSW this weekend. Here&#8217;s the <a href="../2003/03/09.html">post from one year ago</a>, also during SXSW.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also voting day here in Texas. On the one hand it will be annoying to vote after the Democratic nomination has already been wrapped up, but on the other hand I&#8217;m not voting for a candidate so much as an idea. We can do better.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve written a few posts about technology, and about the upcoming Oscars, but I can&#8217;t bring myself to post them. They seem so insignificant compared to the political process in front of us.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party has lost its way. I&#8217;ve never been more disillusioned with government and the people&#8217;s power to effect change for our common good than I am right now.</p>
<p>Congress has failed us. We need someone with real backbone in the November election, someone who can bring this party back on track. That person is <b>not</b> John Kerry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never given money to a politician before, but I did last week. I&#8217;ve never written letters to undecided voters in another state urging them to support a candidate, but I did last night. I&#8217;ve never made the leap from disgruntled voter to political activist, but I am right now.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I have no idea what will happen in New Hampshire tomorrow. The media slammed Dean all last week, but it&#8217;s clear if you pay attention to the <a href="http://wireservice.wired.com/wired/story.asp?section=Breaking&amp;storyId=817325&amp;tw=wn_wire_story">polls</a> and the <a href="http://blog.deanforamerica.com/archives/003354.html">turnout for Dean&#8217;s events</a> that the winds are shifting again. People are coming back to Dean. If he had another week I&#8217;d say he&#8217;d come away with the win in New Hampshire, and the momentum to have a strong showing in the next batch of states. With just one day left&#8230; who knows.</p>
<p>I thought a lot about how I should deal with politics on this weblog. Many bloggers who I respect have chosen to keep their opinions to themselves. I was going to do the same, and the few political posts I&#8217;ve made to this blog over the last year I&#8217;ve kept non-partisan.</p>
<p>But the last week I have been completely obsessed with the post-Iowa coverage, and I can&#8217;t see myself continuing to think and write about this election without being clear in who I support.</p>
<p>Howard Dean is the real deal. The other candidates are above average, but Dean is the most honest, has great accomplishments to show as governor of Vermont, and is the strongest candidate to face Bush. When Dean speaks it really resonates with people, gives them hope for this county. Despite the loss in Iowa, his grassroots campaign is impressive, with average contributions less than $100, and hundreds of volunteers traveling from other states to help the campaign. I still believe that the way he can win in November is by exciting new voters and getting Democrats and Independents (and <a href="http://republicansfordean.us/">Republicans</a>?) to turn out in record numbers.</p>
<p>I subscribe to the other main candidates&#8217; weblogs as well. <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/01/23#When:5:12:36PM">Dave Winer criticized</a> the Dean weblog for not going far enough, but the other weblogs are much worse. They are updated infrequently and usually lack any personal touch. John Edwards doesn&#8217;t even provide summaries in his RSS feed. But the topper is this headline from Kerry&#8217;s weblog yesterday morning, where they misspell &#8220;bloggers&#8221;. Oops.</p>
<p><center><img src="../images/2004/kerry_bloogers.jpg" width="334" height="107" alt="Kerry's bloogers"></center></p>
<p>Sure, that&#8217;s a silly criticism. It was clearly just a typo, and actually the Kerry weblog has improved considerably over the last week. But it&#8217;s funny because it plays into an assumption that Dean is the only campaign that really gets the technology of this election. Which, from my experience, is true.</p>
<p>Online activism will be huge this year. The power of <a href="http://www.moveon.org/">MoveOn.org</a> and the <a href="http://dean2004.meetup.com/">Dean Meetup</a> is in providing a channel for ordinary Americans to effect an election instead of sitting at home grumbling that &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing I can do.&#8221; It&#8217;s about bringing more people into the process. But to do that right, we need a candidate who can speak passionately to the issues and inspire voters. That&#8217;s Dean.</p>
