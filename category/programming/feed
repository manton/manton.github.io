				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2016/04/01/uikit_for_macs">Brent Simmons has a good post</a> about the pros and cons of bringing UIKit to the Mac. On the differences between iOS and Mac development, though, one point did stand out for me:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  And there are things Macs don’t have at all — navigation controllers, for instance, since they don’t make sense in a context where you can just show the hierarchy via multiple panes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Brent&#8217;s right that most Mac apps don&#8217;t need navigation controllers. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have any use for them in my Mac app, <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart</a>, for example. But navigation controllers are becoming more common in Mac apps, starting with Twitter apps especially. I expect an important part of Iconfactory&#8217;s work on <a href="http://chameleonproject.org/">the Chameleon framework</a> to bring Twitterrific to the Mac was supporting navigation controllers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll always consider myself a Mac developer first, even though most of what I do these days is on iOS and for the web. I&#8217;d definitely welcome UIKit for Mac. I&#8217;m getting closer to announcing a new iPhone app and web platform, and while I have a Mac version in development too, I can&#8217;t justify the time right now to finish it. UIKit for Mac would make that decision much easier.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/01/release-notes/">Ben Brooks takes on</a> the trend of cute stories inside of release notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With disturbingly increasing frequency, companies are deciding to let their marketing departments handle their release notes instead of the engineering team or product manager.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. These were fun at first, but the release notes don’t need to be entertainment. They should be a summary of what changed, with bullet points for key changes. (A single “bug fixes” line is also not helpful.)</p>
<p>I personally like to start each line with a clear statement: “Fixed &lt;something&gt;” or “Added &lt;this feature&gt;” or “Improved &lt;something else&gt; by &lt;doing this&gt;”. You can see this in <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/releasenotes/">the history of my Tweet Library release notes</a>, for example.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/">Bad news from the Parse team</a> at Facebook today:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We have a difficult announcement to make. Beginning today we’re winding down the Parse service, and Parse will be fully retired after a year-long period ending on January 28, 2017. We’re proud that we’ve been able to help so many of you build great mobile apps, but we need to focus our resources elsewhere.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>For years I had always heard great things about Parse. I eventually used it for the first time a few months ago on a client project. It’s got a well-designed API, friendly monthly pricing (free for many apps), and it seemed well supported, with new features like tvOS support and a web dashboard redesign rolling out <em>just a month ago</em>.</p>
<p>Thinking about <a href="https://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/692845189816123392">this tweet from Daniel Jalkut</a>, I&#8217;ve always advocated for iOS developers to also be good at web services. Customers expect sync everywhere now, and you can do things with your own server that will give you an advantage over competitors who have a simpler, standalone iOS app. But being forced to migrate server data isn’t fun, especially on someone else’s schedule.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Cieplinski ported his iPhone timer app Fin <a href="http://www.joecieplinski.com/blog/2016/01/25/fin-on-a-bigger-screen/">to the Apple TV</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Three weeks of spare hours here and there to get myself familiar with the HIG, the UI challenges, etc. was well worth the effort, as far as I’m concerned. And now I get to see if any of my users find the TV app useful, or if I pick up any new attention as a result of being there.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hearing stories like this, and thinking about my own apps, I’m convinced that the Apple TV needs split-view support like iPad multitasking. Our apps could be off to the side of the screen while someone uses most of the TV for watching shows or running another full-screen app. Just as I suggested that <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/lightweight-universal-apps.html">lightweight universal apps</a> are okay, there is a class of apps that would <em>become more useful</em> when they don’t have to monopolize the entire TV.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the holidays, or while on any vacation, I usually use iOS more often than my Mac. It&#8217;s easier to quickly catch up on email or fun stuff like Instagram without getting too pulled away from what matters: spending time with family and friends. So as I use iOS, I&#8217;ve been thinking about what might make the iPad better.</p>
<p>Last year <a href="http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/133180873570/saving-the-ipad">Jared Sinclair blogged about</a> some of the problems with the iPad, with ideas for &#8220;saving&#8221; it. The most interesting of these was his suggestion of a &#8220;Gatekeeper for iOS&#8221;, where iOS apps could easily be side-loaded onto iOS without Apple&#8217;s approval:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “These apps would be just as secure as apps published on the App Store. I recommend that Gatekeeper iOS apps be subject to the same API restrictions, privacy permissions, and sandboxing as apps distributed on the iOS App Store”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Daniel and I discussed this on <a href="http://coreint.org/207">Core Intuition episode 207</a>. We acknowledged that as great as it would be, this compromise of Gatekeeper apps being subject to API restrictions might not be possible. The whole point of Gatekeeper is to leave Apple out of the distribution process, so there would be no place to impose such restrictions except at the API level. Still, I&#8217;d welcome any kind of side-loading.</p>
<p>Most Mac developers have wanted a Gatekeeper-like solution for iOS since the very beginning of the iPhone. Back in 2011, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2011/02/30_of_the.html">I wrote a post</a> about Apple&#8217;s 30% cut and the lack of side-loading for iOS:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Apple’s tight control over iOS has always been troubling. If there’s no way to install an app on the device without Apple’s approval, then Apple can make or break any business that builds for the platform. It’s an added risk for the thousands of tiny development shops for which the iPhone and iPad are otherwise perfect.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>But side-loading isn&#8217;t really holding back the iPad. What&#8217;s holding it back is the slow pace of progress in UI improvements. For example, the home screen remains virtually unchanged since iOS 3, and on the iPad Pro the classic grid of large app icons looks more like the <a href="http://apple.wikia.com/wiki/Parental_Controls">Simple Finder</a> than a way to manage and launch productivity apps.</p>
<p>More key areas of the UI need to take inspiration from iPad multitasking. While split-view and slide-over aren&#8217;t perfect, they&#8217;re <em>something</em>. Likewise for iOS extensions, which were such a step forward that we were willing to overlook the UI clunkiness. These new features helped <a href="http://www.speirs.org/blog/2015/12/22/all-in-on-ipad-pro">Fraser Speirs switch to an iPad Pro full time</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The introduction of multitasking in iOS 9 has made a significant difference to the way I work on iOS. I don’t need to rehearse the actual features here but suffice to say that I now find iOS extremely easy to get almost any task done.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see Apple experiment more. To not be afraid to try something new with the UI and ship it, as long as they still follow up and refine it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a great feature idea to take multitasking further, from <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/12/2016-wishlist-ios">Stephen Hackett’s iOS wishlist</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I&#8217;d like Apple to work on some way to share text and images between apps that are side-by-side. If I&#8217;m working in a text editor, I&#8217;d like to send a selected portion right into Slack, without having to worry about a share extension or dropping back to copy and paste to get the job done.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nilay Patel, in a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/28/10676272/2015-apples-year-in-beta">2015 wrap-up for The Verge</a>, wrote that Apple has been setting the groundwork for new platforms, and that this year they will have to iterate and improve on what they&#8217;ve started. He sees the iPad Pro in particular as a step forward without a clear defining feature:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;There&#8217;s a chance we&#8217;ll all be using huge iPads as our primary computers one day, but to get there the iPad Pro has to do something so much better than a MacBook that all the things it does worse seem irrelevant. What is that thing?&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>That missing &#8220;thing&#8221; is clear to me: the Apple Pencil is the best stylus that has ever been made for a device — tablet, desktop, or standalone display. It&#8217;s so good that I assumed I would sell my retina iPad Mini and use the iPad Pro exclusively.</p>
<p>That hasn&#8217;t happened. I realized when making the choice of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/12/3255.html">which iPad to take downtown the other week</a> that the Mini is still my favorite size. I hope as part of the next phase to Apple&#8217;s iPad platform that the Pencil makes it down to the rest of the iPads. It&#8217;s important that developers can count on the common availability of the stylus, just as we can count on multitasking and app extensions to set the pace of UI progress for the platform.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the iPad first shipped, many developers embraced completely separate apps for iPhone and iPad. The argument was that they were different platforms and deserved special design attention (and separate revenue). I never bought this argument, and eventually — with the iPhone 6 Plus and multiple screen sizes — everyone agreed that it just made more sense to use universal apps.</p>
<p>At the same time, there&#8217;s a parallel argument that an app on the iPad shouldn&#8217;t just be a &#8220;scaled up&#8221; version of the iPhone. That if you can&#8217;t invest the time to do a universal app properly, don&#8217;t bother.</p>
<p>The redesigned Twitter iOS app was a great example of this. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/twitter-aims-to-unify-ios-apps-updates-its-ipad-app/">It was widely mocked</a> for it&#8217;s poor use of space on the iPad.</p>
<p>With the iPad Pro and widespread iPad multitasking, I think this changes again. An iPad app that is designed exactly the same as its iPhone version is still very useful in slide-over and split screen. In fact, for many &#8220;iPad&#8221; apps I use every day on the iPad Pro, I use them in their compact layout <em>more often</em> than full screen.</p>
<p>My next app was designed for the iPhone. I spent some time trying to rework it with split views for the iPad Pro, but I just can&#8217;t justify the work right now to finish that effort. I&#8217;m going to ship it as a &#8220;lightweight&#8221; universal app anyway, though, so that it&#8217;s available in slide-over. To me, that&#8217;s a worthwhile compromise, significantly better than no offering on the iPad at all.</p>

I bet there will be some more progress in Swift web server frameworks by then, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we talk about on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/11/episode-208-crazy-and-doomed-to-failure/">Core Intuition episode 208</a>, I finally got an Apple Pencil. It&#8217;s great. My experience matches <a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2015/11/the_hype_is_real.html">Gus Mueller&#8217;s</a>, about how good the Apple Pencil is after years of using Wacom tablets and third-party iOS styluses:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I find that when using the HB Pencil in Procreate, I get something that is very, very close to what I feel when I&#8217;m drawing in my sketchbooks. But of course now I&#8217;ve got layers and many colors and a perfect eraser to work with. And endless pages. I love it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the question of whether it&#8217;s a &#8220;stylus&#8221;, <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/11/pencil-2/">Ben Brooks sums it up</a> this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;That’s the question I get asked a lot from people — my wife especially. Apple will tell you it is not a stylus because it is so much better than any other stylus, it clearly is something else. So, instead, I’ll tell you that it <em>is</em> very much a stylus — it just so happens to be the best stylus I have ever encountered on any device.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been improving the Apple Pencil support in an iPad app I&#8217;m working on. I haven&#8217;t completely finished reading <a href="http://www.russbishop.net/uitouchtypestylus">Russ Bishop&#8217;s article</a> on supporting the Apple Pencil, but looks like it has a bunch of additional tips in it that I&#8217;d benefit from. It covers not just the API changes to UITouch, but also gestures, coalescing, and predictive touches.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s start with a quote <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-review/">from the MacStories review</a> by Federico Viticci:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;For developers, it&#8217;s time to be bold with their iOS apps and understand that they can be more than single-purpose utilities. There are millions of people who aren&#8217;t buying PCs anymore because mobile devices are their only computers.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using the iPad Pro a lot in just the last two days. Apps that have taken advantage of the larger screen — and that support iPad multitasking well — are just much more useful. It&#8217;s great to have Slack or Tweetbot in the sidebar and a writing app in the main part of the screen. (Until Editorial is updated, <a href="http://sethclifford.me/2015/11/things-i-like-this-week-volume-15/">like Seth Clifford</a> I&#8217;ve switched to Byword.)</p>
<p>As a developer, going from an iPad Mini to an iPad Pro has opened my eyes to what Federico says above. You simply can&#8217;t have a great iPad app today if it doesn&#8217;t attempt to fit well on the iPad Pro. So although <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/11/winding-down-my-twitter-apps.html">I said</a> I would discontinue my app <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>, I&#8217;ve actually been spending some time this week to <em>update it</em> to support iPad multitasking.</p>
<p>The key to iPad Pro support is actually less about auto layout (although that&#8217;s helpful too), and more about split views and size classes. For a modern app, this is an easy transition. But Tweet Library was written for iOS 4. Back then, UISplitViewController was extremely underpowered. I had used MGSplitViewController instead, which I&#8217;ve modified over the years to adapt to multiple screen sizes from the iPhone to the iPad. So the first step to real iPad multitasking was to rip out most of the split view code and start over with a clean foundation based on iOS 8/9 and UISplitViewController. Not exactly trivial work that I could knock out in a day, although I tried.</p>
<p>I remain very optimistic about the iPad Pro, especially <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/the-incomplete-ipad-pro.html">when the Apple Pencil is actually available</a>. From a business standpoint, it also seems like a better investment in time than either the Apple Watch or Apple TV. There are so many platforms and distractions now. If I can&#8217;t focus on a single platform, I want to at least be proactive in saving some attention for the iPad.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three weeks ago I had about a dozen open Jira tickets. Today, my last day with the company, most of those are still open. I was able to update some documentation and do minor maintenance work, but a bigger change I had hoped to deploy turned out to be impossible because of a missing internal API.</p>
<p>It’s unsatisfying to leave unfinished work. There’s only so much that can be done in a limited time, though, and as we all know software (especially a web app) is rarely ever completely finished.</p>
<p>Bittersweet, moving on after so many years. The folks I’ve worked with have been really great. I’m going to enjoy keeping an eye on what they ship long after my GitHub access has been revoked.</p>
<p>This morning, my (now) former boss and good friend <a href="https://twitter.com/willie">Willie Abrams</a> linked in the company chat room to some of the photos that he had taken over the last 14 years. Brought back a lot of good memories, from brainstorming app features in a conference room to wandering around San Francisco before WWDC.</p>
<p>I think I’m going to let this be the final post to wrap up the “two weeks notice” series. I’ve accomplished a lot but there is still plenty left, especially <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/two-weeks-notice-new-products.html">shipping new products</a>. It’s been good to force myself to write every day, so I’ll keep that going with the usual full posts and <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">microblog posts</a>.</p>
<p>You can find all 14 posts under <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/2weeks">the tag “2weeks”</a>. Thanks for reading.</p>
