				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In 2014, web app APIs basically look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON or XML API layer for a web site&#8217;s content and functionality.</li>
<li>Potential client developers must register with the web site and get some kind of API key for access.</li>
<li>OAuth is used to grant access without giving out passwords.</li>
</ul>
<p>A more cynical view of that last point could be rewritten as: OAuth is used to control and limit access so that the API is inaccessible without approval from the web site.</p>
<p>This all seems fairly normal today. I required an API key for Tweet Marker because that&#8217;s just what you did, especially if you wanted to charge or limit an API. But it didn&#8217;t always used to be this way — remember when you could hit the Twitter API with just a user&#8217;s password? — and it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way forever.</p>
<p>For my next web app I&#8217;m going to have an API that is more open, requiring no app registration. Instead it will be <em>user-centric</em>, with password tokens that a user can paste into their favorite compatible app for authentication. (My web app doesn&#8217;t have traditional passwords at all.)</p>
<p>Not having API keys removes a whole set of complexity: no need to write all the backend code to support managing them, no need for developers to register, no need for me to judge who should get access. Whenever possible, APIs should be nearly as open as the normal web, where Safari and &#8220;curl&#8221; don&#8217;t need to register with a web site just to download its home page. Users are in the best position to know which apps should get access to their account anyway.</p>
<p>If we can loosen APIs, I think it makes the web better. <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/09/28/#a1411931064">Dave Winer takes it one step further</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;What we really need, and I hope to help make happen, is a network based on open syndication of content. Then there is no one to ask for an API, because there&#8217;s no one in charge.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been calling my latest project halfway decentralized. I&#8217;m still in charge, but just barely.</p>

			<p><a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2014/9/the_wilderness.html">Great post by Gus Mueller</a> on losing your way in a project:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ve been making foundational changes to your app. You&#8217;ve been spending time cleaning up your code, rewriting those hacks you&#8217;ve been wanting to fix for years now. Or you&#8217;re targeting a new SDK and there&#8217;s all these deprecated methods to replace. So while important change is happening, you don&#8217;t seem to be moving forward. You look up and all of a sudden notice this has been going on for weeks and you&#8217;ve been standing still all this time, and now you&#8217;re standing still for no reason at all. And you&#8217;re lost in the wilderness.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I work on several apps throughout the week, evenings, and weekend. Most people would say: too many apps. The only way I can possible keep up is if every minute that I&#8217;m at the keyboard I&#8217;m productive, on the right path to finishing the project. Usually I can do it. But even so, I frequently fall into exactly the wilderness Gus describes, losing valuable time off in the weeds on things that just don&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>The difference between those who can ship apps and those who indefinitely have a great idea that&#8217;s never complete often comes down to how much time we&#8217;re lost in the wilderness. By giving it a name we can recognize when it happens and hopefully recover more quickly.</p>

			<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2014/09/05/dave_on_javascript_apps">Brent Simmons isn&#8217;t totally convinced</a> about the new crop of JavaScript frameworks:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Part of me thinks those frameworks are overkill (even jQuery), and that writing regular-old JavaScript to do what you want is not that onerous a thing, and will make for leaner, better code.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This was how I felt when I built <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>. It uses jQuery and Bootstrap, but otherwise it&#8217;s pretty old-fashioned JavaScript. Even the parts that are Ajax just fetch and insert HTML that has been rendered by the server. There&#8217;s not much to do in the client.</p>
<p>For my latest project I&#8217;m using <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>. I want this app to be <em>very</em> fast, and I think putting more work on the web browser is the way to do it. I only know the basics of the framework so far, but already I like it. It feels lightweight to use, even if the actual JavaScript include is fairly large.</p>
<p>And 100k is really not that big of a deal anymore. You don&#8217;t want bloat for no reason. But look at a popular site like twitter.com and you&#8217;ll see several JavaScript files between 200k and 500k each. They get cached and no one complains about performance.</p>

				<a href="../../../2014/05/sunlit_12.html" rel="bookmark">Sunlit 1.2</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Sunlit version 1.2 is <a href="http://taps.io/Ld3g">now available in the App Store</a>. It includes a few minor improvements and one major change: you can now use the app with only a Flickr account. It no longer requires App.net.</p>
<p>We hope this will allow more people to try the app. At any time, you can always add your App.net account to the app’s settings and it will unlock the more advanced features: syncing, sharing stories to other App.net users, and multi-user collaboration so that anyone can add photos and edit text in a story.</p>
<p>Making App.net optional instead of required meant rethinking what the minimum features were that all users should have. Obviously you have to be able to create stories, add photos, include text descriptions, and use filters. But we also kept coming back to one thing: we could not ship without also supporting web publishing. The bulk of work on Sunlit 1.2 was creating a parallel implementation for publishing that would seamlessly work with exactly the same UI, with or without App.net.</p>
<p>Some people may ask why we chose Flickr instead of creating our own user accounts system, or simply having no registration. To support publishing, it helps to have some unique username for a user, and a secure way to authenticate them on the server. It won’t surprise anyone to hear that <em>a lot</em> of people have Yahoo accounts. With a redesigned web and mobile experience, plus 1 TB of free photo storage, Yahoo’s giving Flickr something of a new resurgence. There’s a lot we could build on the Flickr API.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sunlit’s App.net support is a powerful differentiator and we’ll continue to improve it. It lets you own your data, share it with other apps like Ohai, and sync to multiple users. I still believe in the App.net API and user community; it’s too good a platform to give up on.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/05/07/manton-adn-api">Marco Arment responds</a> to my comment that developers should have seen the potential of the App.net API as something much bigger than Twitter. I wanted <a href="../../../2014/05/appnet_niche.html">my post</a> to be short, but Marco makes good points that are worth following up on. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Building an app on someone else’s API, rather than making your own, is a huge risk: it usually only pays off if the service provides a huge existing userbase and hard-to-duplicate functionality. App.net never offered either. They started out facing the typical social-network chicken-and-egg problem, put a huge paywall in front to prevent any growth, and tried to alleviate that by adding more chicken-and-egg problems to their offerings.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Building entirely on App.net for <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> was indeed a huge risk, and one that we expected would take time to pay off. It was a bet on the future. We are incredibly proud of our app and the response it got in the App.net community, but our goal was always to make an app <a href="../../../2014/01/no_coincidence.html">that appealed to everyone</a>, not just a small niche of tech folks. We’ve actually been working for over a month on a new version of Sunlit that expands the reach of the app beyond App.net, and coincidentally it just went into review at Apple this week.</p>
<p>But I think the chicken-and-egg problem was solvable. The main issue with iOS apps is that they couldn’t sign up a new user directly in the app. This made sense when App.net was a paid-only service, because you’d run into in-app purchase issues with Apple, but it became more technically feasible when the free tier launched.</p>
<p>The App.net founders also seemed receptive to the idea. There just wasn’t time to make it happen. I believe this single roadblock prevented any potentially-mainstream <a href="../../../2013/08/waiting_for_appnets.html">killer apps</a> built on App.net from getting off the ground. If it’s not easy to open a third-party app, create an account, and start using the service, too many people will give up. (Our numbers showed that only 40% of Sunlit downloads actually signed in to use the app for real.)</p>
<p>However, building our own backend for the app would also be very challenging and expensive. We are not syncing small bits of data around. It’s a photo sharing app, so right off the bat you’ve got big files that have to be hosted somewhere. On top of that there’s collaboration features, so you need not just user accounts but private sync channels that have specific read/write access to certain users. Plus all the metadata and formats to support syncing text, photos, and location check-in information. Not to mention publishing HTML, thumbnails, and maps. It’s daunting.</p>
<p>(In fact, it’s so daunting, I don’t think there’s a single app in the App Store that has feature-parity with Sunlit. The app simply could not have been built by a tiny team of 2 part-time developers if building a whole backend infrastructure first was a prerequisite.)</p>
<p>Marco closes with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “As much as App.net wanted to be — and eventually was — much more than a Twitter clone, it got the vast majority of its initial funding, enthusiasm, and developer support from people’s anger at Twitter’s dickification. But internet outrage doesn’t last long. Since App.net never became the new primary place where our friends all hung out, most of us never left Twitter — we all just accept that they’re dicks now, and we forgot about App.net.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s an argument to be made that App.net’s core mistake was building the Alpha web interface only far enough to match Twitter’s features and then moving on to other things. Instead, they could have kept improving Alpha until it was significantly better than Twitter, so good that it couldn’t be ignored. By doing so, maybe they would have also more effectively demonstrated the power of the API underneath.</p>
<p>I assume that App.net chose not to do this so they wouldn’t compete with developers. After all, the service was founded on the idea that developers should be respected and given every opportunity to succeed. Finding the right balance to showcase the platform with first-party apps without stepping on developers is not always easy. We can argue about which missteps were the most costly, but the founders never wavered on their original principles and they promoted every app that launched on the platform. That means something.</p>
<p>As for outrage not lasting long on the internet, Marco’s totally right. I just <a href="../../../2014/05/would_i_go_back.html">don’t forget that easily</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>There&#8217;s a new update to <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> out today. Major additions include CSV file export to Dropbox and new URL schemes for starting a search, export, or publish. The URL schemes look like this:</p>
<p>twtlib://username/search?q=hello&amp;collection=Favorites</p>
<p>twtlib://username/export?collection=Testing</p>
<p>twtlib://username/publish?collection=Testing</p>
<p>twtlib://username/storify?collection=Testing</p>
<p>There are a few other important bug fixes too, especially to importing the Tweets.zip archive from Twitter.</p>
<p>When I gave up on Twitter as a user, many people asked if I would abandon Tweet Library. I wasn&#8217;t sure at first, but the answer now is a clear &#8220;no&#8221;. In fact, since my last personal tweet in 2012, I&#8217;ve released new features and even redesigned the app for iOS 7.</p>
<p>But I do need to start consolidating my work on Tweet Library and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>, because the apps share so many concepts around archiving and search. To that end, this week I&#8217;m retiring tweetlibrary.com as a way to browse and publish collections. The site will now redirect to a special landing page on Watermark. Published collections from Tweet Library also go to a public page on Watermark.</p>
<p>It was a tough decision to change the tweetlibrary.com URLs, but maintaining separate web apps that are so similar made everything more complicated, holding back what I could build. Having a single web codebase (Watermark) will ultimately let me improve both Tweet Library and Watermark more quickly.</p>

			<p>David Smith says to <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2014/02/28/please-dont-push-me/">not bother the user with alerts on first launch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I have just sorted through the App Store and settled on trying out your app. I open it up and you immediately ask if you can send me Push Notifications? I have no context about what these are going to be used for or why they might be useful to me.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. For <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a>, we only prompt to enable push notifications after you’ve chosen to enable sharing for a story. While it might be useful to have push notifications for everyone, by waiting until we <em>really</em> need it, most users are never bothered with the alert. And it forced us to focus on specific and valuable uses of notifications, such as sending a push notification when someone subscribes to your shared story.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Today we shipped version 1.1 of <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a>, our app for collecting photos and text together to make and publish stories. Some of the bigger changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instagram and Flickr import.</strong> You can now add any of your own Instagram or Flickr photos into a story. With Flickr, you can even browse from your Flickr sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Dropbox support.</strong> The first version of Sunlit assumed most of your photos on Dropbox were in the Camera Uploads or Photos folder. For 1.1, we’ve added a full Dropbox browser so you can pick any folder you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-user text syncing.</strong> Now anyone subscribed to a story can add both photos and text descriptions, and the text will sync to all users. This is a really powerful feature for collaborating on stories. We think it puts Sunlit in a class above any other app like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confirm deleted photos.</strong> What happens if you let other people add photos to your story, but they accidentally delete one of your photos? Sunlit now tracks this and shows a special confirmation alert so that you can either allow the photo to be deleted or keep it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other fixes and improvements too, which you can <a href="http://sunlit.io/releasenotes">see in the release notes</a>. Here are a few screenshots of the new Dropbox and Flickr screens:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2014/sunlit_dropbox_flickr.png" width="600" height="336" alt="Sunlit v1.1" /></p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/sunlit/id690924901?mt=8">Sunlit is available in the App store</a> as a free download. If you like it, pay just $4.99 to unlock the full app, and leave a review in the App Store to help others discover the app. Thanks!</p>

<p>Good advice. And remember, very few developers actually ship on time. Even if you think your app is going to ship before the next major version of the OS does, your app will probably be late. More people will be able to run it than you first expected.</p>

			<p>If you’ve been reading my blog for a very long time, or listening to <a href="http://coreint.org/">my podcast</a>, you probably know that in addition to my business <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">Riverfold Software</a>, I also have a “regular” job at <a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/">VitalSource</a>. As that company has grown, I feel less comfortable blogging about my work there, since I can’t speak for the company or even the smaller group I directly work with.</p>
<p>But this month is my 13th anniversary (!) with VitalSource, so I thought it would be interesting to look back on the times I’ve blogged about my work there, and highlight some of things I’ve helped build.</p>
<p>One of the earlier posts, back in 2005, was <a href="http://manton.org/2005/08/vitalsource.html">about our new store</a>, where I linked to blog posts from James Duncan Davidson, Mike Clark, and Ryan Irelan about the project. But nearly a decade of migrating between blog systems has taken its toll; my post is still there, but the other links are all 404 not found.</p>
<p>Then from 2007, I wrote about <a href="../../../2007/01/bookshelf_note_sharing.html">syncing highlights and notes in e-books</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The architecture is based on the Simple Sharing Extensions (SSE) for RSS and OPML. On top of that we have added a VitalSource namespace and a few extra XML elements and attributes to keep track of Bookshelf-specific data, such as highlighter color and selected text within a book. The goal is to keep it as open as possible, so that in the future we can both consume other sources of user notes, and allow third-parties to also hook into the data in interesting ways.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>We recently updated the API to use a new, faster sync architecture, but the web app is still in use today. I’ve been updating it for Rails 4, a tedious process because of the Rails community’s fascination with deprecation.</p>
<p>Again in 2007, I mentioned updates to two of my favorite apps, MarsEdit 1.2 and NetNewsWire 3.0, along with <a href="../../../2007/06/new_software_releases.html">VitalSource Bookshelf 4.6</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “At VitalSource we also just released Bookshelf 4.6 today, which lays the foundation for media-rich textbooks and adds a highlighter rating UI for any subscribed highlighters you have. This data will bubble up in a few places in the future to allow you to discover people and books, although for now it’s one-way.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s neat looking back on this post because it includes a <a href="../../../screencasts/2007/bookshelf_rating.qt">short screencast of the app</a> from 2007, presumably running on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger. The promise of this highlighter ratings feature never really materialized, though.</p>
<p>In 2010, <a href="../../../2010/03/ipad_ships_next.html">I thought about the iPad</a> right before its release:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I’m working on 2 apps for the iPad. The first is just a minor iPad refresh of an existing iPhone app at VitalSource called Bookshelf Noteview (iTunes link). It’s for reading notes and highlights synced from our e-book platform.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Noteview was eventually removed from sale. The other app I hinted at would become <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>.</p>
<p>Around the same time, <a href="http://manton.org/2010/03/mac_os_x_server.html">I blogged about Mac OS X</a> as a server platform:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “At VitalSource we now have a dozen Xserves running Ruby on Rails and a couple others running MySQL. While it’s mostly stable now, over the years there have been several mystery show-stopper problems that no one seems to have on other platforms.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously Apple no longer sells the Xserve. At VitalSource all our best new servers run Linux.</p>
<p>Also in 2010, <a href="http://manton.org/2010/08/congratulations.html">I reflected on how a team grows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “If you’re working by yourself and add another person to the project, a funny thing happens: you become a manager. Before, you could spend 100% of your time on the work. Now you can allocate 50-75%, because you’re getting the new programmer up to speed, answering questions, and setting priorities. If you’re lucky (and I usually am), the person you added is contributing so much that it easily makes up for your loss in productivity, and then some.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Later in 2010, I described how we <a href="../../../2010/09/bookshelf_touch.html">shipped Bookshelf for iPhone</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “At its core the app is 3 parts: a large C++ codebase, brand new Objective-C UI code, and a bunch of clever WebKit and JavaScript work. In many ways it’s a more difficult project than my other iPad app (still in development), but some great coders contributed to different parts of the architecture, before and after I joined the project.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are other posts, but I think these hit some of the more interesting milestones in the last 13 years. I also have an archive of earlier, company-internal blog posts, starting in 2001, that I hope to look into and publish pieces from one day.</p>

			<p>I’ve long been a fan of <a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a>, an iPhone app from my local Texas friends David Barnard and Justin Youens. It’s handy even for fairly simple tasks — firing off web searches or other shortcuts into apps — but it’s especially powerful when wiring up multiple apps together. For Sunlit it was nice to provide some full actions that Launch Center Pro users could use to automate bringing content into Sunlit.</p>
<p>Jonathan has <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/01/28/the-schemes-of-sunlit/">the full rundown on the URL schemes</a> that Sunlit supports and why we think they’re important. You can also use the Action Composer inside Launch Center Pro to access these actions without having to type them in.</p>
<p>And just today, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/launch-center-pro-for-ipad-review/">Launch Center Pro for iPad shipped</a>. Check it out and explore <a href="http://actions.contrast.co/">some of the many apps</a> like <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> that are supported.</p>

<p>iOS already ships with a mapping framework from Apple that all apps can use, so why did we ignore it in <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> and use <a href="http://mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> instead? Two main reasons:</p>
<p><strong>Custom map colors.</strong> I was interested in creating beautiful new maps that would give Sunlit a unique design. Maps in every other iOS app look exactly the same. Sunlit is automatically more distinctive just by choosing something different, and we barely scratched the surface of the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/woodcut-inspired-map/">customization that is possible on Mapbox</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Direct web API.</strong> Mapbox gives you access to your maps not just in a native iOS map view, but also over the web. For the story backgrounds in Sunlit, we grab rendered maps directly with an HTTP call. This is a lot simpler and faster than having to build an interactive map view and snapshot it.</p>
<p>It also helped that I’ve been following the cool stuff Mapbox has been doing ever since <a href="http://codesorcery.net/2011/03/04/working-with-development-seed">Justin Miller joined their team</a> a few years ago. I could tell this was a company that wanted to push the technology of maps forward. Apple needs to spend all their time building a viable alternative to Google Maps — driving directions, business locations, better search. But I don’t care about any of those things in my app. For Sunlit I want to use a framework from people who clearly love maps, and I think that’s Mapbox.</p>

			<p>It was Macworld Expo in 1997, and Steve Jobs had just come back to Apple. Somehow I was lucky enough to get a seat in the keynote, and I sat there with a big grin on my face as Steve came out to talk about NeXTSTEP, which would eventually become the foundation for Mac OS X. He likened developing an app to constructing a building, one level at a time. A good OS allowed you to build higher.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s DOS gave you very little, so you had to start at the ground floor. Developing for the Mac and Windows was like starting out on a 5-story building. But the developer tools from NeXT were like starting out on the 20th floor, because they were so advanced, because they “lifted the developer up” and let apps be developed more quickly than if you had to deal with all the basic foundational stuff every app needs.</p>
<p>I think the App.net API is that same kind of advancement for apps compared to most other web APIs. It is significantly more consistent and full-featured than anything else out there.</p>
<p><a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> syncs stories and photos with App.net, using your App.net private file storage (for storing photo data) as well as private channels and messages (for syncing story titles, permissions, and other metadata). We like this solution because everyone who signs in to the app with their App.net credentials gets sync automatically. It also means that if you authorize other apps to see your App.net files, you can manage the data Sunlit syncs there, or get it out again without us having to directly build an export feature.</p>
<p>(Although we do offer a number of export choices in Sunlit, such as saving photos to your camera roll, sharing them on social networks, or sending them to any app that supports “Open In”. We do this <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/01/20/sharing-about-overshare/">with OvershareKit</a>.)</p>
<p>Publishing in Sunlit is another feature that utilizes App.net file storage. It allows you to take a story — photos and text — and publish it to a URL. The URL is public, but it’s not linked from anywhere unless you directly share the URL with someone. This makes it convenient for quickly publishing a set of photos and sending the link to family, for example.</p>
<p>Here’s what the published stories currently look like: <a href="http://sunlit.io/manton/nationalparks">http://sunlit.io/manton/nationalparks</a></p>
<p>On the surface this may look like Sunlit is uploading photos and other data to sunlit.io, where it’s probably stored in a relational database or on the server filesystem somewhere. But that’s not how it works at all.</p>
<p>The iPhone app actually uploads all photos to App.net file storage, marks the new files public, then generates a static HTML page and also uploads <em>that</em> to App.net. It then registers the story with sunlit.io, which caches the HTML just to make things a little faster. We never store any photos on sunlit.io itself, instead merely referencing their public URLs on App.net. (View source on the page to see the proof.)</p>
<p>This difference means you can move the site anywhere just by copying files from App.net, with any number of available <a href="https://directory.app.net/">file management tools</a>. Or just copy the HTML file to your own server to serve the page from your own domain. The CSS and JavaScript is all bundled inline in the HTML, except jQuery, which loads from a URL.</p>
<p>We think this approach makes the whole system a lot more flexible and open. Your data is never hidden inside the app and your published pages are never locked behind a server.</p>
<p>Several months ago <a href="../../../2013/08/waiting_for_appnets.html">I wrote this about App.net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The promise of App.net is bigger than one type of app. App.net isn’t just a blank slate; it’s an amplifier. It’s waiting to power the next new idea and help it grow into something big.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I still believe that. It’s making apps easier to build and more powerful, just like NeXTSTEP was. There’s really no other web platform like it. That’s why we picked it for Sunlit.</p>

<p>You have that feeling when hanging out with friends — everyone snapping pictures of their surroundings, of people, events, food, anything — that <em>photo sharing should be better</em>. That years later, you should be able to go back to that time, to see the best photos collected together from several people. And not just photos, but maps of where you were, and text to describe its significance.</p>
<p>One afternoon before Çingleton in 2012, this subject came up as Jonathan Hays and I were taking photos around Montreal. It seemed remarkable and disappointing to us that there was no easy way to put those photos together. And I liked the idea of buildling a new app around photos, with the same themes of curation and preserving past events that are so important to my other Riverfold products.</p>
<p>So we let the idea sit in the back of our minds, and later we wrote a little code as time allowed. At <a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/06/11/app-net-hackathon-recap-2/">the App.net hackathon before WWDC 2013</a> we dove into the project in earnest, figuring out how it would sync, then over the summer took some more time to think through the user experience.</p>
<p>Sharing a single photo has been done a hundred times on iOS. Instagram was an important app to nail the timeline UI, and <a href="http://favd.net/">Favd</a> is currently my favorite way to post and browse new photos (it’s really great). But hardly anyone has even attempted to tackle photo curation, group sharing, and publishing, let alone gotten it right. Sunlit 1.0 is our first pass at this and we couldn’t be more excited about trying to solve a new problem with photos.</p>
<p>They say you should spend money on experiences — on memories, not things. Sunlit helps you put those memories together, share them as a group, and rediscover them when it matters. The first version <a href="http://sunlit.io/">will ship tomorrow</a>. I hope you like it.</p>

			<p><a href="http://successfulsoftware.net/2014/01/10/new-shiny-thing/">Andy Brice had a good post recently</a> about shipping:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Continually abandoning work in progress for a new idea is also a form of cowardice. If I never ship, then I can’t fail. But I can’t succeed either. And I won’t learn anything useful from a string of half-finished products that never shipped.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been reminding myself of this to combat any self-doubt as <a href="https://alpha.app.net/cheesemaker">Jon</a> and I prepare <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> 1.0 for release. There is plenty to worry about: bugs we might have missed, potential confusion about how sync works, whether free with in-app purchase was the right call. But I’m proud that we took an idea from well over a year ago, prototyped it, rewrote it, and refined it, finally building it into an app that will ship.</p>

			<p>The latest version of Tweet Library was approved by Apple last night. It features an updated design for iOS 7, a new app icon, and a bunch of bug fixes. I also dropped the price to $4.99, universal for both iPhone and iPad, and it’s a free upgrade for all existing customers.</p>
<p>The App Store screenshots weren’t updated yet, so I put together <a href="http://sunlit.io/manton/tweetlibrary24">some screenshots using Sunlit here</a>.</p>
<p>I’m pretty happy with how this release turned out, but there’s still more work to do. I’ll be following up this release with some additional improvements specifically for iOS 7 soon. You can grab version 2.4 <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/tweet-library/id365768793?mt=8">from the App Store here</a>.</p>

								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/08/the-great-app-net-mistake/">Mat Honan wrote an article for Wired</a> about App.net. It does a great job of capturing the history of App.net and why it’s different from Twitter. And it’s positive for all but the closing paragraph, which is either discouraging or a wake-up call, depending on your optimism. I recommend reading the whole thing.</p>
<p>Here’s what Mat says about what’s missing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “But there’s still something missing, that seems totally obvious: a game. App.net needs a <em>Dots</em> or a <em>Candy Crush</em> or a <em>Words With Friends</em> that plugs into its social sphere. Something that isn’t just useful, but fun. Something wonderful.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>App.net does need a hit, a new kind of app that doesn’t resemble Twitter. If that turns out to be a game, then great. But I don’t think it has to be. There are hundreds or maybe thousands of games in the App Store that are excellent but which never made it big. The success of App.net can’t be pinned to such an uphill battle.</p>
<p>I do know one thing: the next great app for App.net will come from the App.net community, the developers who are passionate about the API’s potential, just as early developers like <a href="http://iconfactory.com/">Iconfactory</a> who took a risk on Twitter 6 years ago are still having an impact on that service today. The next great app will come from the developers who see App.net as a way to build new things.</p>
<p>I’m working on an app like that. It uses the App.net API, but not the timeline. It takes pictures, but isn’t really a photo app. It integrates with <a href="http://ohaiapp.net/">Ohai</a>, but isn’t another location check-in app. It renders beautiful maps throughout, but isn’t about navigation. Some of the features I’m most proud of in the app wouldn’t be the same without App.net.</p>
<p>There’s no way to know what apps will resonate with the mainstream, and which will remain niche or failures. But to have any hope of success, you have to start. You might even have to take a risk on a new platform if you want to build something new.</p>
<p>The promise of App.net is bigger than one type of app. App.net isn’t just a blank slate; it’s an amplifier. It’s waiting to power the next new idea and help it grow into something big.</p>

			<p>I love <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/7/8/the-architecture-twitter-uses-to-deal-with-150m-active-users.html">this detailed write-up of the Twitter backend</a> as it exists today. Sending a tweet to your followers uses a massive Redis cluster with a couple terabytes of RAM:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Let’s say you tweet and you have 20K followers. What the fanout daemon will do is look up the location of all 20K users inside the Redis cluster. Then it will start inserting the Tweet ID of the tweet into all those lists throughout the Redis cluster. So for every write of a tweet as many as 20K inserts are occurring across the Redis cluster.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>A listener of <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> asked me today if I had second thoughts about no longer using Twitter, especially since I still maintain a Twitter app. We’ll discuss this on a future episode, but the short answer is: no, I don’t regret it. I have a huge amount of respect for what Twitter has built at a technical level, and for the opportunities it gives people to communicate. I just don’t like their attitude toward developers.</p>

			<p><a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2013/july/engelbartWasSidelined">Dave Winer writes about Doug Engelbart</a> and the pace of changing computing systems:</p>

  “If you want to get the most out of great developers like Engelbart, who are productive well into their 80s, you have to stop digging up the streets, moving the goalposts, bombing the cities, starting over just for the sake of starting over.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>While there’s certainly a time to <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/06/11/fertile-ground">burn the forest for new growth and opportunity</a>, I have little patience for those developers who spend more time <a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/4_0_release_notes.html">breaking old code than creating new value</a>. Maybe it’s a sign I’m getting old — that I’ve lost my taste for innovation at a technical low level — but I don’t look forward to rewriting all my working code again and again.</p>
<p>Very little has changed in this regard since I wrote <a href="../../../2010/08/deprecation_mentality.html">a blog post about deprecation</a> in 2010, which (fittingly) also linked to Dave Winer.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/ios-7-vs-instagram-vs-google-vs-twitter-black-white-photo-filter-comparison">Rene Ritchie has a nice comparison of black and white filters</a> in iOS 7 and third-party apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “To create the comparison, I took the screenshots posted on Apple.com, isolated the unfiltered image, loaded it into the other apps, applied their filters, and then took screenshots of the resulting images.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on an iOS 7 app that&#8217;s partly <em>about</em> photos, though not actually a camera app, and I always thought it&#8217;d benefit from a single great black and white filter. Not as one of a dozen filters, but as the only filter in the app — something strikingly different that would be noticed. iOS 7&#8217;s built-in filters and apps like <a href="http://www.pacifichelm.com/cameranoir/">Camera Noir</a> have made me reconsider. Why reinvent the wheel when so much good work is being done on filters by other developers?</p>
