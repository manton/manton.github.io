			<p>I&#8217;m renaming Tweet Marker Plus. Its new name — to better reflect its gradual move away from Twitter and syncing — is <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>.</p>
<p>As part of the relaunch it immediately gains a new feature: <a href="http://join.app.net/">App.net</a> posts. You can now add an App.net account and it will download any posts from your friends, making them available for search. Watermark is already storing tens of millions of tweets, and I&#8217;m excited to start adding App.net posts to that archive as well.</p>
<p>So what happens to the basic Tweet Marker API? For now, nothing. The sync API that <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">over 22 Twitter apps</a> support will still be called Tweet Marker and remain Twitter-focused. Think of Watermark as a separate app: a new kind of client and archive tool, independent of Tweet Marker.</p>

			<p>With every day since <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api">Twitter’s new rules</a> were announced, my opinion grows stronger that this is the end of the platform as we’ve known it for the last few years. It hurts that <a href="http://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/">so much of what was pioneered by the developer community</a> has been co-opted and trademarked and turned against developers. Nothing will change tomorrow; we can expect new versions of Tweetbot, Twitterrific, and my own app Tweet Library. But in the long run it’s a dead-end.</p>
<p>Lex Friedman, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1168222/twitter_app_makers_trying_to_figure_out_the_future.html">writing for Macworld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Some developers are notably hesitant to speak on the record, lest they incur Twitter’s wrath; the fear seems to be that since Twitter is now exerting more control than ever over access to its API—which developers leverage to make their Twitter apps work—that irking Twitter too much might result in a developer’s API access getting revoked.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I have less at stake than developers with popular mainstream apps, so in a way I feel it’s my duty to speak out when it’s warranted, where others can’t. I’m quoted in <a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/08/21/twitter-secured/">Matthew Panzarino’s article</a> on the Twitter API change, and I was <a href="http://www.kqed.org/news/story/2012/08/20/105989/new_twitter_rules_restrict_app_development_sales?category=bay+area">interviewed for a radio spot on San Francisco’s KQED</a>.</p>
<p>I could live with some of the API changes. I could live with the display requirements, even the user caps. Maybe I could live in a developer-hostile environment, finding a market niche far below Twitter’s radar. Except for two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Timeline integrity”</strong>: The display guidelines say you can’t mix other content in a timeline of tweets. You can’t easily have a multi-platform app that shows both App.net posts and Twitter tweets in the same view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trademarks</strong>: You are allowed to use “Tweet” in the name of your app, but only if Twitter is the only service you support. You can’t add Facebook or App.net or Heello support alongside Twitter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are anti-competitive and unworkable. So I’ve decided to spin off Tweet Marker Plus, my paid web-based app that builds on top of the Tweet Marker sync engine. I’ll relaunch it with a new name, slowly introducing new features that aren’t tied exclusively to Twitter. For a hint of where it’s going, you can <a href="https://alpha.app.net/manton">follow me on App.net</a>.</p>

			<p>Despite <a href="../../../2012/05/clipstart_142.html">everything I said</a> about how easy it would be for customers to upgrade from the Mac App Store version of Clipstart to the direct download version, in the real world this doesn&#8217;t appear to be working well for some customers. Might be a little buggy, and it&#8217;s too late to fix anything in the Mac App Store. So I&#8217;m doing upgrades the old-fashioned way, giving everyone new serial numbers.</p>
<p>After the first few emails came in, I automated this with <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/upgrade/">a simple form</a> that customers can fill out. It&#8217;ll give them a new serial number right away and email the registration information. I&#8217;ve added a link in the FAQ on the <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart home page</a> too.</p>

			<p>Gabe at Macdrifter comments on <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/07/1password-on-the-mac-app-store/">the shift back to direct download for 1Password</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I recall the <a href="http://forum.agilebits.com/index.php?/topic/8048-1password-only-from-app-store/">massive forum discussion</a> about the decision to take 1Password MAS only. I converted to the MAS version in March to get on-board with their product roadmap. Now I see that <a href="https://agilebits.com/store">it is available again as a direct download purchase</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/roustem">@roustem</a> confirms it will <a href="https://twitter.com/roustem/statuses/224965704015810560">receive the next update soon</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve never liked the idea of being exclusive to the Mac App Store. I don&#8217;t think any of those transitions — from 1Password to Pixelmator — were good for users, especially when customers had to re-purchase a product they already owned. I hope sandboxing will at least make more developers think twice about pinning their business to the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>The blog post continues with this point, and all the good and bad that comes with it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;This is the MAS as I see it: It is not for utility apps or power users. Apps like 1Password, TextExpander and Keyboard Maestro should all be purchased directly from the developers site. The MAS is for people afraid of using a computer.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words: it&#8217;s good for some users and some apps, and not others. And that&#8217;s okay. I have no regrets about pulling <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart</a> from the Mac App Store. I think of my app as pretty easy to use, but it&#8217;s for people who get file systems and tagging and uploads. Most definitely <em>not</em> for people afraid of using a computer.</p>

			<p>Excellent piece from Joel Spolsky yesterday on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/07/09.html">software inventory and bug databases</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The trouble is that 90% of the things in the feature backlog will never get implemented, ever. So every minute you spent writing down, designing, thinking about, or discussing features that are never going to get implemented is just time wasted. When I hear about product teams that regularly have ‘backlog grooming’ sessions, in which they carefully waste a tiny amount of time and mental energy every day or every week thinking about every single feature which will never be implemented, I want to poke my eyes out.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of the original Getting Real from 37signals. <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Forget_Feature_Requests.php">Back in 2006</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “So what do you do with all these requests that pour in? Where do you store them? <strong>How do you manage them? You don’t. Just read them and then throw them away.</strong>”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It sounds blasphemous but the ones that are important will keep bubbling up anyway. Those are the only ones you need to remember. Those are the truly essential ones. Don’t worry about tracking and saving each request that comes in. Let your customers be your memory. If it’s really worth remembering, they’ll remind you until you can’t forget.”

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Today I released <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart 1.5</a> for direct download customers and removed the previous version of Clipstart from the Mac App Store. Even though I&#8217;ve written about leaving the Mac App Store several times, actually pulling the trigger was difficult. But I believe it&#8217;s the right thing for my app, right now.</p>
<p>Clipstart 1.5 is still $29. Changes for this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now requires Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. Please do not upgrade to this version if you are running 10.5 or 10.6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added &#8220;Consolidate&#8221; command for finding videos that have not been imported or duplicates outside the library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added AppleScript support for uploading videos. See the help menu for scripting examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved performance throughout the app, especially with importing and refreshing video thumbnails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved error message when failing to import all videos from a camera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed tags field on Add Folder dialog not resetting tags value after an import.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion&#8217;s Gatekeeper security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been thinking about buying Clipstart but were on the fence before, I&#8217;ll throw in a discount for you. Use coupon code MANTONBLOG to save 20%.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.c-had.com/history-repeats-itself/">Chad Sellers has a post</a> comparing Mac App Store sandboxing to mistakes from Linux, with this very reasonable advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I believe that Apple should have at least led the way by sandboxing all of their own apps sold through the Mac App Store (I believe they have not sandboxed a single one of their 17).&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of Twitter. When <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/collections/manton/xauthtooauth">Twitter forced third-party clients to move to OAuth</a>, but didn&#8217;t change their own app to use it, many developers said it was a double standard. Twitter&#8217;s response: the official Twitter app was part of the service, not really a separate app, so it didn&#8217;t need to use OAuth.</p>
<p>Maybe Apple could make the same case for Mac OS X&#8217;s built-in apps: Address Book, iCal, and Mail don&#8217;t need to be sandboxed because they are part of the operating system. But that argument doesn&#8217;t work for Keynote or iMovie. Those apps should play by the same rules that all productivity and video software in the store does.</p>
<p>If Apple were to sandbox a few of these it would go a long way toward convincing developers to do the same. And it would also shake out bugs and missing APIs in the whole sandbox environment.</p>

TextExpander is the first popular app I&#8217;ve seen to do it.</p>
<p>Moom is another one that actively encourages users to move away from the store. Recently on launch Moom displayed a news window that included this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Apple has <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1167055/sandboxing_deadline_arrives_what_it_means_for_apple_developers_and_you.html">activated sandboxing</a> on the Mac App Store; under the sandboxing rules, we can no longer add new features to the App Store version of Moom (we can only fix bugs). However, we have a method by which you can migrate (<strong>at no cost</strong>) to our direct sales version of Moom, which <strong>has no such limitations</strong>. For details on how sandboxing affects our apps, and how to migrate to the direct sales version, please <a href="http://manytricks.com/sandbox">read this article</a> on our blog.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even Panic – frustrated with the long approval times for Coda 2.0.1 – is experimenting with how best to let Mac App Store customers migrate to the direct version. <a href="http://twitter.com/panic/statuses/215505347371220992">See this tweet and screenshot</a> from Cabel Sasser.</p>
<p>This has been a theme on the last couple episodes of <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>. Daniel Jalkut and I talked about how we feel about sandboxing after WWDC, and more on my decision to migrate Clipstart out of the store. Things are getting better in Mountain Lion, and I&#8217;ll revisit my decision next year, but for now I think I made the right call to focus on work outside the Mac App Store.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Just approved in the Mac App Store, Clipstart 1.4.2 fixes upload issues with YouTube and especially Vimeo, which was broken in previous releases because of Vimeo API changes. I expect this to be the final Mac App Store release for Clipstart. <a href="../../../2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html">As I blogged about before</a>, all Mac App Store customers can upgrade to the direct download version for free.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you should do if you bought Clipstart from the Mac App Store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update to Clipstart 1.4.2 using the App Store app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run Clipstart at least once, then quit it. This allows it to copy the Mac App Store receipt so that it&#8217;s accessible to other versions of the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the latest version from the <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">main Clipstart web site</a> and replace the existing copy in your Applications folder with the direct download.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you&#8217;re thinking about buying Clipstart for the first time, please get it directly from the web site and checkout via PayPal. There&#8217;s also a demo with support for 2 uploads and tagging 20 videos.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now turning my attention to version 1.5, which will improve a few things and add support for Gatekeeper on Mountain Lion.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>A few things have changed since <a href="../../../2011/10/redisonly_migration.html">I last talked about hosting</a>. Tweet Marker passed 200,000 total users to the API. There are more apps and more platforms. And of course Plus launched with new requirements for database and search indexing of tweets.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a graph showing monthly hosting costs for the last year, stopping just short of $600/month for April:</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="../../../images/2012/tweetmarker_hosting_chart.png" alt="Tweet Marker hosting chart" title="tweetmarker_hosting_chart.png" border="0" width="479" height="212" /></p>
<p>The first dip was when I moved away from Heroku&#8217;s dedicated PostgreSQL database, to Redis on EC2. The more recent increase is when I updated capacity for Tweet Marker Plus.</p>
<p>Tweet Marker currently runs on both Heroku and Amazon EC2. On Heroku, there are 6 dynos: 5 web dynos with 3 Unicorn processes each, and 1 background worker. I also run hourly scheduled tasks that add a small number of extra dyno-hours, and sometimes I&#8217;ll fire up additional temporary workers.</p>
<p>For Amazon, I run with 3 medium server instances: 1 for Redis master, 1 for Redis slave, and 1 for search with MySQL and Sphinx. The search server is partitioned across multiple EBS volumes, each one mounted as a separate MySQL database and Sphinx index. It is possible for me to move a database or search index shard to a different EC2 instance if I need to, as well as move customers between shards.</p>
<p>The volumes look like this in Amazon&#8217;s admin UI:</p>
<p><img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;" src="../../../images/2012/tweetmarker_volumes.png" alt="Tweet Marker volumes" title="tweetmarker_volumes.png" border="0" width="369" height="271" /></p>
<p>I picked 20 GB shards because it seemed like about the point where the database would be too big to be fast, given the modest hardware. It&#8217;s enough to hold several months of tweets for all the users in a shard. I estimate how many users should be in each shard, and when it reaches that number I roll new accounts to the next shard, and so on.</p>
<p>Backup dumps for the Redis database and MySQL get sent to S3 every hour and every day, where I keep the last 24 hourly backups and the last 31 daily backups. I also do occasional EBS snapshots.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t currently need a MySQL slave for backups. If I lose a drive, when I restore the last hourly backup, Tweet Marker Plus will automatically add any missing tweets lost during the downtime to bring things back to a current state.</p>
<p>Overall I&#8217;m happy with this setup. It&#8217;s as simple as I could design it. Hosting is not cheap, but I think I can run for the rest of the year with very few changes and mostly fixed costs. I also plan to switch to reserved instance pricing at Amazon, which should be a significant discount.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve made it this far, you probably care enough about servers and Twitter that you should consider signing up for Tweet Marker Plus yourself. Check out <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/plus">the details here.</a></p>

			<p>I released a small bug fix update to Clipstart today, version 1.4.2, to fix an issue with YouTube uploads when using your Gmail address sign-in instead of the YouTube account username.

You can see the <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/releasenotes/">full release notes for recent bug fixes here</a>.</p>
<p>As I said <a href="../../../2012/02/sandboxing_followup.html">earlier this year</a>, there will only be a couple more releases of Clipstart in the Mac App Store. My current plan is to switch completely over to direct-only sales with version 1.5.

			<p><a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">VoodooPad 5</a> is out this weekend, with a new file format that plays nicely with Dropbox. <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/blog/archives/2012/04/voodoopad_5.0_released.html">Gus Mueller says</a>:</p>

  “No more connecting to WebDAV servers and having to deal with authentication issues and strange HTTP errors. Now you can just put your VoodooPad 5 document in a Dropbox folder and VP will detect when pages have been updated.”

<p>This is another good example of where web APIs like Dropbox can be <a href="../../../2012/04/icloud_vs_the_web.html">more useful than iCloud</a>. Multiple people can collaborate on a VoodooPad document, and the direct download and Mac App Store copies of VoodooPad can sync together.</p>
<p>Also new in version 5 is native support for Markdown and an ePub export option. <a href="../../../2007/01/falling_in_love.html">The workflow for help documentation</a> that I posted <em>5 years ago</em> carries over to VoodooPad 5 just fine, too.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This MacStories article&#8221;:http://www.macstories.net/stories/iclouds-first-six-months-the-developers-weigh-in/ covers the progress that developers have made adopting iCloud over the last 6 months. Over the next 6 months, we should have an even better appreciation for what iCloud is and isn&#8217;t good for.</p>
<p>For iOS backups and iTunes Match, iCloud is fantastic. For private, app-specific data that doesn&#8217;t make any sense away from a single developer&#8217;s native Mac and iOS apps, it&#8217;s also excellent. There&#8217;s no question that using Macs, iPhones, and iPads today is a significantly better experience thanks to iCloud.</p>
<p>But there are two fundamental limitations in iCloud that make it inappropriate for a bunch of syncing uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>No way to access it from other platforms or web apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No way to share data between apps from different developers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect Apple to change this. Again, for what iCloud was made for, these limitations are fine. It simply means that iCloud cannot replace web APIs that <em>do</em> solve these two problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s what I wrote&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/06/faq_for_tweet_marker.html not long after announcing the Tweet Marker API:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The primary goal with Tweet Marker is to enable different Twitter apps to work together. iCloud is designed for storage and syncing only between apps from the same developer, so it&#8217;s not appropriate as a replacement architecture for Tweet Marker.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Think back to the so-called Web 2.0, which gave us web services to access previously closed-off data. This eventually led to truly dominant syncing APIs like Dropbox, Simplenote, and Instapaper. At the same time, we all have more devices than ever before. Syncing exploded on iOS in text editors and note taking apps. Without a proper shared file system between apps, or even an event or scripting system, these iOS apps looked to web APIs as the only way to communicate.</p>
<p>That has turned out wonderfully. With web APIs as the only solution, we see more compatibility between apps and more web services popping up all the time. If you create a new web app, it&#8217;s dead without an API. Every success of the modern web, from Flickr to Twitter, has an API that is available from any platform.</p>
<p>So then what about iCloud? If Web 2.0 made data more accessible, iCloud takes that same data and&#8230; keeps it closed. It&#8217;s a step forward on user convenience and a step back on interoperability.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a developer considering iCloud support, just make sure your data fits there. Ask yourself if your data is all about your app, or <em>if it&#8217;s bigger than your app</em>. Developers who are willing to take a risk on building an open API instead of iCloud could see new opportunities: web-based views of their data, compatibility with other apps, and syncing on the Mac outside of the App Store.</p>
<p>A couple years ago, &#8220;Shawn Blanc said about cloud syncing&#8221;:http://shawnblanc.net/2010/08/sans-cloud/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And my next wish? A cloud-based service like Instapaper, but for to-do items. I want it to be available in apps like Tweetie, Reeder, and more, so when I click on &#8216;Do Later&#8217; it sends the link or item of note into a running to-do list (that syncs with Things, of course).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine if Things or OmniFocus or another tasks app opened up a slice of their private syncing API to make the Instapaper of to-do inboxes. Now take other APIs for all of the useful apps we use. Not just to-do apps as Shawn mentions, but RSS, photos, blog drafts, sketches, and more.</p>
<p>What I wrote above about Tweet Marker is still very much true. Since then, Tweet Marker has become the standard for last-read syncing between Twitter apps, with support for 15 apps and many more in development. I want to see more syncing platforms like this. Let&#8217;s think big and make apps work together.</p>

			<p>The day after I &#8220;wrote about removing Clipstart from the Mac App Store&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html, Apple announced that the sandboxing requirement would be delayed again. In that announcement was also a new twist: sandboxing would not be required for bug fix updates to existing apps.</p>
<p>This is welcome news, but I stand by my post. I still plan to transition Clipstart away from the MAS. The difference now is that I can do it at my own pace, providing a new version or two to MAS customers that will make the move easier.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already gotten started. Clipstart 1.4 just shipped with a few new features and better support for recognizing MAS receipt files. I&#8217;ve also submitted it to the Mac App Store, where it is waiting for review.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear where we are going to end up with sandboxing. &#8220;Quoted in Macworld&#8217;s coverage&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/165502/2012/02/sandbox_deadline_delayed_yet_again_to_june_1.html, Paul Kafasis suggests that sandboxing is so flawed that Apple should just scrap the whole thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael Tsai talks about&#8221;:http://mjtsai.com/blog/2012/02/20/sandboxing-and-clipstart/ all the work that is required to stay in the store. He closes with something that I&#8217;ve been thinking about:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At each step of the way, it looks like just a little more work to get into the Mac App Store, or to stay there. Until the next issue pops up. And then, if you&#8217;re successful, you&#8217;re sort of locked into it due to the reasonable expectations of your many customers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This lock-in creates two immediate problems with leaving the Mac App Store:</p>
<ul>
<li>What about customers who may have originally bought the app directly from me, but decided to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; to the Mac App Store version? I&#8217;m sure I only have a few of these, but it&#8217;s still unfortunate if someone bought the app twice. I&#8217;m just glad I didn&#8217;t follow the lead of MAS-exclusive developers, such as &#8220;Pixelmator&#8217;s effort to encourage customers&#8221;:http://www.pixelmator.com/blog/2011/01/06/transition-to-the-mac-app-store/ to switch to the MAS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do current Mac App Store customers get notified that there is a new version available outside the store? Sparkle is not allowed in the MAS, but I think the right thing to do here is provide a similar notification in the app. It would link to a web page with instructions for downloading the app directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit I have some regret leaving the Mac App Store. It&#8217;s just so convenient for purchasing and installation. If I&#8217;m going to make this work, I&#8217;ll have to redesign my own rather clunky purchase and activation experience. And I&#8217;ll have to do a much better job of marketing, something that has not been easy with Clipstart.</p>

			<p>I wrote a draft of this post a few weeks ago, before Mac OS X Mountain Lion was announced. It was pretty critical of Apple&#8217;s aggressive approach to sandboxing, and I&#8217;ve kept most of that, but the new Gatekeeper feature for Mountain Lion at least gives me a way out. I don&#8217;t think Apple would have created Gatekeeper if they planned to abandon apps sold outside of the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>For the next release of my app <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart</a>, I will be removing it from the Mac App Store and only selling directly from my web site. With Gatekeeper I hope to have some confidence that my customers will still be able to run the app on future versions of the OS.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s take a step back, to a good <a href="http://furbo.org/2012/01/23/sandboxing/">blog post from Craig Hockenberry</a> on moving xScope to use sandboxing. One of the most important things to keep in mind is that what works for one app may be unsuitable for another. Craig touches on this with an example from Panic&#8217;s Transmit:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Of course there are some applications that have a harder time than others: primarily if those apps require access to all or part of the filesystem (think about syncing data with Transmit, for example.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Clipstart also falls into the same &#8220;needs to access the whole file system&#8221; category as Transmit. It&#8217;s not just one feature; the whole app is based on the fact that it can point to video files anywhere on the system, or manage your video library in a central location on any hard drive. These are things that are difficult to do in the sandbox, but even worse, I don&#8217;t see a clear path forward for existing customers to move into such a restrictive environment.</p>
<p>Maybe I could file bugs with Apple for exemptions, and reduce the functionality of my app to fit within the limits of the sandbox, but I&#8217;ve made the decision that it is just not worth it. I would much rather spend 100% of the time I have for Clipstart on new features only, not playing catch-up with Apple.</p>
<p>Atlassian has <a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/02/between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place-our-decision-to-abandon-the-mac-app-store/">made a similar decision</a> for their app SourceTree. On the sandboxing restrictions:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The trouble is, the sandboxing implementation currently in place on Mac OS X Lion doesn&#8217;t allow for all the behaviours that real Mac applications do _right now_, behaviours which are not at all contentious, are approved in the Mac App Store already, and indeed are very much appreciated by users.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/2324/fix-the-sandbox">Daniel Jalkut continues this argument</a>, saying that sandboxing <em>could</em> be good for developers, if only the current entitlements weren&#8217;t so very incomplete. That&#8217;s true. But we can only make decisions based on what entitlements and APIs are there today, and today it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>I will try to make this casualty of sandboxing as painless as possible for Clipstart customers. I will honor Mac App Store receipt files so that everyone can migrate to new versions of the app. And I&#8217;ll provide extra serial numbers to anyone who asks, for fresh installs on machines that never had the Mac App Store version.</p>
<p>Clipstart has turned out to not be a very good fit for the Mac App Store anyway. It&#8217;s the kind of app that you need to download and try out before committing your whole video library to it. Sandboxing is just the latest and most significant in a series of frustrations with the MAS.</p>
<p>For my customers, sandboxing isn&#8217;t actually a feature; it&#8217;s a bottleneck to getting work done. I can&#8217;t justify spending any time on it. I already have a product and platform (<a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> for iOS) where I can play the app review game. I want my Mac app to be a break from that, with a total focus on making the app better and a release schedule and feature set that I control.</p>
<p>So it was a relief to hear about Gatekeeper. I don&#8217;t want pulling Clipstart from the MAS to automatically doom the product, and now I don&#8217;t think it will. Instead of shying away from features that won&#8217;t work in the sandbox, I can even embrace them as a competitive advantage. I&#8217;m more excited than ever to get back to Mac development without this decision and <a href="http://inessential.com/2012/02/17/daniel_on_fixing_the_sandbox">chilling effect</a> hanging over my head.</p>

			<p>The best critique and praise for Heroku is that it&#8217;s opinionated: only deploy with Git, only use PostgreSQL. On the whole this is a good thing, because it simplifies the choices that developers have to make. Fewer choices means more time to spend on things that matter.</p>
<p>But at $200/month for a dedicated database, there&#8217;s a very real cost with PostgreSQL on Heroku. For a service like &#8220;Tweet Marker&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/ that is currently free, I wanted to save money on hosting and simplify things down to a single database. I might have preferred to streamline to PostgreSQL-only, since it&#8217;s rock solid and Heroku&#8217;s tools are excellent for managing backups and moving data around, but Resque (which Tweet Marker uses to process background work) is built on Redis. If I wanted to streamline to a single database, it had to be to Redis.</p>
<p>Tweet Marker as essentially an OAuth-wrapped key/value store anyway, so why burden the app with a full relational database? The handful of extra tables I had for tracking users and sessions could also be migrated to Redis. And even though it&#8217;s a memory database at heart, it is persistent, so I can use it for real data.</p>
<p>I conducted the transition in stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I was using Redis for stats. Because Redis has an atomic increment command, it&#8217;s trivial to use it to keep counters on various metrics: total number of reads/writes per hour, day, or month, broken down by different Twitter clients. This was my first use of Redis outside Resque tasks and it performed great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, I moved the marker data. I wrote a script to dump all the data from PostgreSQL to Redis, and at the same time modified Tweet Marker to write data to both locations when requests came in. I let that run for about 2 days to confirm that the data was identical in both places before shutting PostgreSQL down and routing reads to Redis only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, I finished moving some additional tables to Redis so that I could completely shutdown PostgreSQL. Again, simple is better.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this was using Heroku&#8217;s &#8220;Redis To Go&#8221;:https://redistogo.com/ add-on. I love it because there&#8217;s no configuration; click a couple buttons and you have a server. But as soon as I was running full time on Redis To Go, I started to be concerned that I had given up a great amount of control over my data. While Redis To Go conveniently offers daily backup snapshots, it doesn&#8217;t appear to have any commands for restoring data or otherwise getting access to the server and Redis files. And though I could probably set up a separate Redis To Go instance and manually send it a slaveof command to turn it into a slave, not being able to edit the config file meant that if the server was rebooted I would lose the slave until it could be reset. Not good.</p>
<p>I also expected I would quickly outgrow the smaller Redis To Go plans, eventually forcing the monthly pricing up to the same level as I was paying for PostgreSQL, but with less control. I had to run my own database server instead. And because Heroku is all on Amazon EC2, it also had to be on EC2 for the best performance between web server and database.</p>
<p>I went to work provisioning an EC2 instance. Initially it ran as a Redis slave to the master on Redis To Go. After I felt comfortable with EC2 and had automated backups in place, I added a separate instance on Amazon for the master and switched the app over to it. The cost for 2 &#8220;micro&#8221; instances is about the same as I was paying for Redis To Go, but with much more available memory, hourly backups to S3, and access to the Redis aof log. And my total monthly hosting costs are about half what they were before.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to keep this setup for at least the rest of the year and well into next. As the Tweet Marker user base grows, I&#8217;ll bump up to higher-capacity EC2 instances. Heroku continues to be really great, so I don&#8217;t expect to change anything there.</p>

			<p>Today was day 7 of the &#8220;first app&#8221;:http://twitterrific.com/ to ship with Tweet Marker support. Overall, things have been working great. I thought I&#8217;d write a little bit about my hosting experience so far.</p>
<p>First, the good news: the service is up and fast. Twitterrific is sending a lot of traffic, even with the preference off by default, but the server app is architected in such a way that things are zipping along nicely. Performance is especially important on the iPhone, where a Twitter client might be saving state on quit and any lag would be pretty obvious. Non-trivial server work, such as hitting the Twitter API, is done in the background using Resque, and the queue size there is usually small too.</p>
<p>There have been two distinct problems, though. Each was a good opportunity to improve the system.</p>
<p>On the first day, the background queue stalled and the requests piled up, so much so that my Redis instance ran out of memory and clients started receiving errors. I upgraded Redis, restarted the app, and bumped up the number of processes to quickly catch up on the backlog. Although it hasn&#8217;t resulted in errors since, it has delayed some requests on 2 more occasions after launch. I also adjusted how I&#8217;m collecting statistics to further improve performance.</p>
<p>More recently, I&#8217;ve noticed some sporadic SSL errors when Tweet Marker tries to verify the user account via Twitter. I added more wait-and-retry logic, and I&#8217;m keeping an eye on this to kick the background script if necessary. There have been no errors in the last couple days.</p>
<p>I still think it was the right decision to host on Heroku. Although I am manually monitoring the server for general health (need to automate this badly), everything is less work than I would do with a colocated box or VPS. The biggest cost is that at the last minute I upgraded to Heroku&#8217;s dedicated PostgreSQL database. I&#8217;m still evaluating that, but I would rather launch with too much horsepower and scale it down later, than not enough.</p>
<p>Again, thanks for your support. It is a little nerve-racking because I know that &#8220;other people&#8221;:http://www.iconfactory.com/ are depending on Tweet Marker being up and performing well. This is a different experience for me than working at a &#8220;larger company&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ with a dedicated system administrator, and also different than server backends for my Riverfold products, where it is only my own customers who will be disappointed if I fail.</p>

			<p>And now for something completely different. I released a bug fix update to &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ last night, the first in over a year. It doesn&#8217;t have some of the bigger things I&#8217;d like to finish for the app, but it does have an important bug fix to Mii rendering.</p>
<p>At some point in a recent update to Safari or Mac OS X, Miis started appearing blank in Wii Transfer. These are rendered in an offscreen window using Flash, then saved as thumbnails in Wii Transfer with the option to export a JPEG. The fix &mdash; for reasons I&#8217;m still not clear on &mdash; was to switch to using NSBitmapImageRep&#8217;s cacheDisplayInRect instead of initWithFocusedViewRect. Needless to say, customers were frustrated that this was no longer working, and I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t take care of the problem more quickly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot lately about the future of Wii Transfer and its companion &#8220;@wii&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii Twitter account. This little Mac app is overdue for a rename and refocused feature set.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Guy English writes about iCloud&#8221;:http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/202 and the magic glue (Push Notifications&#8217; persistent connection) that makes it work:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Each of these new features tickle the persistent &#8216;push&#8217; connection and trigger some action on the device. The short-form state may be transmitted immediately and set on any connected device within moments. Document syncing is likely to trigger a negotiation process to compare the state on any one device with The Truth stored on Apple servers and replace the document on the device with the latest revision &mdash; this has the advantage of limiting the window between syncing where conflicts are most likely to occur.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sync speed matters. The first note sharing server I built for VitalSource years ago assumed a lot of offline time, and despite &#8220;my blogging in 2007 that it was&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/bookshelf_note_sharing.html &#8220;magic&#8221;, in practice it could take 5-10 minutes before all your computers got their act together to get a set of highlights completely synced. With that kind of lag, note edits might happen on a client in the meantime, so we remembered conflicts everywhere and had a UI for resolving them.</p>
<p>Too complicated. The new system, recently rolled out in Bookshelf for iPhone and iPad, syncs so much more efficiently and quickly that conflicts don&#8217;t need the same emphasis. We can throw away a bunch of code and simplify the user interface.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve yet to do anything with iCloud except read the release notes and sit through a couple WWDC sessions, but we&#8217;re going to have a fantastic platform if it can deliver the same speed and reliability of Push Notifications. Guy&#8217;s post is the first I&#8217;ve seen to connect the dots, capturing how well-positioned Apple is to use this plumbing for all sorts of stuff.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I mentioned in &#8220;my first post about Tweet Marker&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/06/tweet_marker.html that there were some decisions still to be made about the service. I don&#8217;t know everything yet, but I do want to answer some common questions I&#8217;m hearing from users and developers.</p>
<p><em>Will Tweet Marker be free?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I do not plan to charge users directly to use the service. There will also be no charge to developers for the basic sync API. However, it will take on real hosting costs, so I plan to have a more advanced paid plan (with more features and stats) so that participating Twitter apps can help pay for the service.</p>
<p><em>How useful is it if the official Twitter app doesn&#8217;t support it?</em></p>
<p>It is still very useful for users of third-party Twitter clients. I couldn&#8217;t allow the official Twitter app to use the API even if they wanted to, because theirs is a free app and has such a huge number of users. I also like that Tweet Marker becomes a selling point and discovery tool for other apps.</p>
<p><em>Shouldn&#8217;t Twitter provide this service as part of their API?</em></p>
<p>That would be great, but Twitter doesn&#8217;t seem interested in providing such a service. They don&#8217;t encourage users to read everything in their timeline, and it would be a little at odds with their focus on only the latest tweets.</p>
<p><em>Why aren&#8217;t you using Apple&#8217;s new iCloud?</em></p>
<p>The primary goal with Tweet Marker is to enable different Twitter apps to work together. iCloud is designed for storage and syncing only between apps from the same developer, so it&#8217;s not appropriate as a replacement architecture for Tweet Marker.</p>
<p><em>Where is it hosted and what language was it written in?</em></p>
<p>It is hosted on Heroku, which also powers the web site for my iPad app Tweet Library. Tweet Marker is written in Ruby with the Sinatra framework, and backed by PostgreSQL.</p>
<p><em>What about sample code for building this into an app?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on an example project for Mac and iOS. In the meantime, remember that it uses OAuth Echo, which is what most Twitter apps should already be using to post to Twitpic and Yfrog. Just change the URL to use the Tweet Marker server and include the tweet status ID in the POST body. To retrieve the value, it&#8217;s just a GET request without authentication. &#8220;See the docs&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/ for more.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> I reworded the part above about whether the service will be free, since I don&#8217;t control how third-party clients will make this feature available to their users. I also updated it to reflect the service name change from Tweetmarks to Tweet Marker.</p>
