			<p>Apple&#8217;s announcement yesterday of a Mac App Store is big news. As soon as the event was over, journalists reached out to developers to get feedback on what it means for existing Mac shops. Reading the variety of responses is fascinating to me, and I contributed some quotes for articles in &#8220;Macworld&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/155061/2010/10/developers_mac_app_store.html and &#8220;Cult of Mac&#8221;:http://www.cultofmac.com/mac-app-store-more-developer-reaction/65036. There&#8217;s also a &#8220;write-up on Ars&#8221;:http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/10/mac-app-store-boon-or-bust-for-developers.ars.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s &#8220;Wolf&#8217;s take on the guidelines&#8221;:http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/1369652253/mac-app-store:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My fellow Mac developers are laughing at the Mac App Store guidelines. They&#8217;re reporting that apps they&#8217;ve been shipping for years &mdash; a number of them Apple Design Award-winning &mdash; would be rejected from the Mac App Store. These are proven apps, beloved by their users. The current guidelines are clearly out-of-touch.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Every developer I&#8217;ve talked to uses at least some private APIs on the Mac, often to work around bugs or limitations in current APIs. It&#8217;s disappointing that the Mac App Store is shipping before 10.7, because 10.7 would be a good opportunity to find out why developers still need private APIs and bake support directly into the next version of Mac OS X to solve common issues.</p>
<p>Can you imagine such rock-solid apps as BBEdit or Transmit being rejected from the Mac App Store? It&#8217;s going to be a lonely launch day full of hasty iOS ports if Apple doesn&#8217;t show some common sense when approving Mac apps.</p>

			<p>Today, Twitter starts &#8220;shutting down basic authentication&#8221;:http://countdowntooauth.com for the Twitter API. One of my favorite Twitter clients, Birdfeed, will be allowed fewer and fewer requests until finally at the end of the month it stops working. Likewise for Birdhouse and Twitterrific 2. And the same for my &#8220;Wii Codes&#8221;:http://wiitransfer.com/codes/ site, until I have a chance to update it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave Winer wrote a fairly negative essay&#8221;:http://www.scripting.com/stories/2010/04/26/theToxicCoralReef.html a few months ago on this so-called OAuthcalypse:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When Twitter breaks all the apps in the OAuthcalypse, they will break all of mine, and I have no intention of fixing them. I don&#8217;t expect anyone to care. But what you should think about is how many of the Twitter apps that you do care about will break and how many of them will say the hell with it? And how many of them will be around for the next time Twitter breaks everything, because that&#8217;s certainly coming unless Twitter develops some kind of philosophy about itself as a developer platform.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to agree with him at first &mdash; I&#8217;m a big fan of nearly everything Twitter does &mdash; but it&#8217;s a fair question to ask whether backwards compatibility is getting the attention it deserves. Software moves fast, but this kind of thing hurts users, not just developers.</p>
<p>In the desktop world, OS APIs are unlikely to change so severely, and if they do you always have the option to run an older version of the OS or app indefinitely. For web services, though, you can&#8217;t keep an older copy of the internet around. Web apps are forced upgrades.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s a solution to any of this. It&#8217;s just part of tech progress, like moving data from old floppy disks to CDs to hard drives to the cloud. But it&#8217;s a bummer when apps get left behind as APIs are obsoleted. Over-aggressive deprecation was common in the Rails world, and &#8220;I was not a fan&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/01/rails_4_years_later.html.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s to the future, Twitter. Keep new API changes versioned and maintain the old stuff. If this OAuth switch is a one-time cost, developers can focus on what makes their apps unique instead of always playing catch-up.</p>

			<p>My first reaction when I started reading &#8220;The Kids Are All Right&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/kids_are_all_right on Daring Fireball was: Well, I had to disagree with a John Gruber essay eventually, might as well be this one. There was no developer program fee when I started building Mac apps! You could write whatever you wanted and share it with friends.</p>
<p>But then I thought more about the $99 hurdle. What was I doing as a teenager and would the procedures Apple has in place now have stopped me? (For context, I&#8217;m 34.)</p>
<p>I started programming for the Mac with THINK Pascal, a beautiful little development environment. Then I moved to C with Dave Mark&#8217;s book, which came with a C compiler on a floppy inside the back cover. Eventually I saved up and bought Symantec C++. Even at an educational discount these were expensive compared to the free Xcode of today.</p>
<p>At that point I&#8217;m pretty heavily invested in the Mac, but the killer was the documentation. I&#8217;m sure I spent hundreds of dollars on &#8220;Inside Macintosh&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Macintosh books. Our senior year in high school, my friends and I would meet at a restaurant before class for coffee and breakfast. I remember I&#8217;d get there early and sit in the booth with one of my oversized volumes of Inside Mac, taking in too much caffeine for my own good while I devoured every page, even the advanced topics that were still over my head.</p>
<p>I lived and breathed this stuff pretty heavily for a few years. To imagine letting a $99 iPhone dev fee and some locked-down APIs prevent me from building apps is laughable. Great computers inspire people to build new software. That&#8217;s how it was when I got my first Mac, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s that way for the new generation of young iPhone and iPad tinkerers.</p>
<p>One day I hope the App Store will be more open. But it is what it is. I&#8217;ll point out where I think Apple can improve, and then I&#8217;ll build and ship anyway. It makes no sense to sit around and complain on my blog about the good old days while some kid half my age is taking his or her idea all the way to the top of the App Store and owning the platform of the future.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>With the iPad set to ship in just a week and a half, I&#8217;ve been quietly reshuffling some of my projects around it. I&#8217;ve written critically of the iPhone and App Store a couple times, such as how the iPhone is a gold rush distraction that &#8220;doesn&#8217;t need me&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/09/its_okay_to_ignore.html. I also stand by &#8220;earlier opinions&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/11/the_only_2.html of how unfixable the App Store is, especially now when it&#8217;s obvious that any effort trying to convince Apple to open the store is completely wasted. They never will.</p>
<p>But I really like what I&#8217;ve seen of the iPad platform so far and I think it represents a big shift for everyday computing in a way that a cell phone can&#8217;t. So I renewed my membership in the iPhone developer program.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on 2 apps for the iPad. The first is just a minor iPad refresh of an existing iPhone app at VitalSource called &#8220;Bookshelf Noteview&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bookshelf-noteview/id333263742?mt=8 (iTunes link). It&#8217;s for reading notes and highlights synced from our e-book platform.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not ready to announce the next app yet, but it&#8217;s a personal project which I had originally written for the Mac over a year ago. I shelved it at the time because I wasn&#8217;t sure there was demand, the backend web services weren&#8217;t mature, and I wasn&#8217;t ready to take it to completion. For the iPad though, it might be perfect.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s ultimately where I see the most interesting potential for the iPad. New middle-ground apps that we haven&#8217;t even thought of yet, not ports from another platform. Apps that would feel small or distracting or wrong on the Mac, yet equally oversized for a relatively underpowered iPhone. Maybe the never-tested-on-a-real-device launch day apps will be buggy and the overall quality low, but I can&#8217;t wait to try them anyway.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Brent writes a fair post&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2010/02/26/on_switching_away_from_core_data on when Core Data is great and when it&#8217;s a performance bottleneck:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I optimized as much as I could, spent tons of time in Shark, went all multi-threaded with Core Data, switched away from my own queuing system to NSOperationQueue, optimized the XML parsing, etc. But performance and memory use on my first-generation iPod Touch (my development test device) was still not nearly good enough with a big unread count (of around 10,000 items).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If I had been writing that post I probably wouldn&#8217;t have praised Core Data as much as he did, although admittedly because I rarely use it, and not at all in any shipping applications. Its approach always seemed slightly wrong to me.</p>
<p>My main reason for sticking with SQL directly is that I know by coding at this lower level &mdash; with my own lightweight model objects on top of FMDB and utility methods for working with the Clipstart database &mdash; that if something is slow it&#8217;s my fault. I can fix things that are my fault. I can&#8217;t fix fundamental design problems in Apple&#8217;s code.</p>

								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The first couple versions of &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ had a very basic search feature. You could enter keywords and it would search filenames, tags, and video titles. You could also enter special terms such as tags=christmas or imported=today, but you couldn&#8217;t mix and match different terms together.</p>
<p>When I started working on a more advanced search parser, I realized that I was about to write a bunch of code that surely someone had already generalized and shared with the world. Tada! &#8220;ParseKit&#8221;:http://parsekit.com/ by Todd Ditchendorf is that framework.</p>
<p>Clipstart 1.3 now supports these kind of searches:</p>
<p><tt>christmas and (@julian or @kids)</tt></p>
<p>also&#8230;</p>
<p><tt>(uploaded=no and flagged=yes) or (date=2010 and @vacation)</tt></p>
<p>I use ParseKit&#8217;s tokenizer to take these apart and then I translate to SQL myself for SQLite. New in 1.3, Clipstart also allows saving any search as a &#8220;smart tag&#8221; for quick access. I&#8217;m very happy with how well it&#8217;s working.</p>
<p>Why not use &#8220;NSPredicate&#8221;:http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/reference/Foundation/Classes/NSPredicate_Class/Reference/NSPredicate.html and friends? I wanted more control over the parser, for example for the @kids shorthand for tags. Eventually I&#8217;ll have a more traditional NSPredicateEditor-like UI for managing searches, but I find that text input is a much quicker way to find things in my video library.</p>

			<p>I finally took the time to give &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ some much-needed attention, releasing version 2.7 of the application tonight. It&#8217;s got the usual bug fixes and some small visual improvements, but the most important change is better video streaming. The biggest mistake I ever made with Wii Transfer was to buy an Apple TV instead of forcing myself to use my own application.</p>
<p>For this release, I sat down with Wii Transfer and a ripped copy of Star Trek, and I just watched it over and over, experimenting with different Flash Video conversion settings and tweaking networking code. I wasn&#8217;t going to release this until I could watch a 2-hour movie without any rebuffering. The quality is never going to be as good as a console or set-top box with dedicated video streaming features &mdash; this is Flash on the Wii we are talking about &mdash; but I&#8217;m happy with what I came up with.</p>
<p>Wii Transfer is still only $19, and version 2.7 is a free upgrade for any customer who ever bought the application going back to 1.0 over three years ago. Also an important reminder: <em>all sales go to charity starting tomorrow, January 20th</em>, as part of &#8220;Indie Relief&#8221;:http://www.indierelief.com/.</p>

			<p>Somehow it&#8217;s been a couple years since I wrote about &#8220;using VoodooPad for authoring help&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/falling_in_love.html. I always meant to update the post with more information, and I still receive occasional follow-up emails from developers who are trying this for themselves. My workflow is virtually unchanged since then, and the help for &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ is built the same way.</p>
<p>Here is the Clipstart VoodooPad document in case it&#8217;s helpful to other developers: &#8220;Clipstart_Help.vpdoc.zip&#8221;:http://manton.org/misc/Clipstart_Help.vpdoc.zip. The important parts are the special pages WebExportPostflightScript and WebExportPageTemplate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, &#8220;Philippe Casgrain wrote a great blog post&#8221;:http://developer.casgrain.com/?p=16 that is nearly identical to what I do, but with more detail and steps for triggering an export from Xcode. Lately I&#8217;ve been pointing people to his post since it&#8217;s more technical than mine was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark Dalrymple also posted&#8221;:http://borkwarellc.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/voodoopad-and-subversion/ a time-saving SVN script for VoodooPad today. I&#8217;ve been needing this!</p>
<p>VoodooPad is just a really good fit for this stuff. (Also see &#8220;Macworld&#8217;s 4-mice review&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/141473/2009/07/voodoopad41.html for VoodooPad 4.1.) Or if you are more of an OmniOutliner kind of person, check out &#8220;Omni&#8217;s Helpify tool&#8221;:http://blog.omnigroup.com/2008/10/02/helpify-the-omni-help-emitter/ for converting outlines to an Apple help book.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In &#8220;episode 21 of Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2009/07/episode-21-the-tyranny-of-commit-access/, I called the Image Capture API &#8220;quirky&#8221;. What did I mean by that? A few things.</p>
<p><em>Refcon.</em> This should be familiar to anyone who has built Mac OS 9 or Carbon apps. I&#8217;ve certainly written plenty of code that stuffed a pointer to an object in the refcon field of a structure or passed to a callback method. It&#8217;s an essential pattern for being able to integrate C++ or Objective-C objects with a C-based API.</p>
<p>For Image Capture, the code might look like this:</p>
<pre>  ICAGetDeviceListPB pb = {};

pb.header.refcon = (unsigned long)self;

OSErr err = ICAGetDeviceList (&#038;pb, YourDeviceListCallbackHere);</pre>
<p>Then in the callback you cast the refcon back to your controller object and go about calling methods and accessing member variables.</p>
<pre>  void YourDeviceListCallbackHere (ICAHeader* pbHeader)

{

YourController* ic = (YourController *)pbHeader->refcon;

[ic doSomethingUseful:pbHeader];

}</pre>
<p>Works fine, but what about 64-bit? The reason I noted this part of the API to blog about was because the first version of my code accidentally cast my pointer to a UInt32. Luckily for us, the refcon is actually declared as an unsigned long instead, so it should share the same pointer size in 64-bit land, where long and void* are both 8 bytes. Other data types in Image Capture, such as ICAObject, are declared to be UInt32.</p>
<p>(What would we do if the refcon was UInt32? The solution is not terribly difficult: use a simple lookup table that maps a random ID or incrementing number stored in the refcon to your 64-bit compatible pointer. But this just doesn&#8217;t seem to be necessary very often.)</p>
<p><em>No delete function.</em> I found this one strange, and had to dig in example code to find the solution. There is no first-class function in Image Capture for deleting objects off of a camera. Apparently this isn&#8217;t a feature that is supported by all devices, but nevertheless it seems common enough that it deserves something more than an enum constant hidden in a secondary header file.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you go about deleting a video off of the iPhone:</p>
<pre>  ICAObjectSendMessagePB pb = {};

pb.header.refcon = 0;

pb.object = (ICAObject)your_movie_id_here;

pb.message.messageType = kICAMessageCameraDeleteOne;

OSErr err = ICAObjectSendMessage (&#038;pb, NULL);</pre>
<p><em>Bad delete on success design.</em> Related to the above, Image Capture has this trick that seems clever at first but which I don&#8217;t think could be used for most applications. You can set a flag to tell Image Capture to delete a video after it imports. Maybe this also explains why there&#8217;s no standalone delete function, but the design feels dangerous to me; if an import fails halfway through importing 10 videos, the first 5 will still be deleted. I much prefer to examine the imported files to make sure they were saved correctly, and then after everything was successful go back and delete the imported objects.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a couple months since we recorded Core Intuition 21, but there are some other segments worth noting. Daniel and I talked about the WWDC 2009 session videos, a plug for &#8220;rooSwitch&#8221;:http://www.roobasoft.com/rooswitch/, beta testing MarsEdit 3, and a listener question about working for non-developer managers.

			<p>Now that I&#8217;m done &#8220;giving away a free iPhone&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/status/3370506213, I can move on to the next phase of my marketing plan: release new and better software! Crazy, huh? Clipstart 1.2 is nearly ready and I&#8217;m very proud of this release. There&#8217;s so much new stuff I could have called it 2.0.</p>
<p><em>Batch export.</em> Select multiple videos and convert them to H.264, or optimized for iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV, and optionally run a script on the results. It can even create an HTML 5 web site and export in Ogg Theora format for Firefox and Opera users.</p>
<p><em>Twitter upload.</em> Works with Yfrog to upload a video and post to Twitter. To include a custom tweet, use the &#8220;Upload with Options&#8221; command, just as you would add a description to a Flickr, Vimeo, or YouTube upload.</p>
<p><em>New tagging interface.</em> Easy way to tag multiple videos from the keyboard. You can also now drag videos to an existing tag to apply that tag to the selection.</p>
<p><em>iSight capture.</em> I wasn&#8217;t planning on adding this until later, but I think it complements the Twitter support well. Capture from the iSight and it records as H.264 and adds the video to your Clipstart library.</p>
<p><em>New toolbar and button style.</em> I shouldn&#8217;t have used the round rectangle scope button style in Clipstart 1.0, so I decided to roll my own that fit well with the toolbar. It&#8217;s still not a standard toolbar but I hope to transition to one in a future version of Clipstart.</p>
<p><em>Change date for multiple videos.</em> You can update the date for multiple videos at once, with the flexibility of changing specific portions of the date, such as just the year or month. Great for correcting dates from cameras.</p>
<p><em>AppleScript support.</em> Just the basics for now, but you can get a list of videos, with tags and other metadata for each.</p>
<p>Plus some other fixes and Snow Leopard compatibility. I plan to release it in the next couple days, just in case Snow Leopard is released on the 28th as rumored. If you are interested in trying a beta and submitting some last-minute feedback, drop me an email at &#8220;support@riverfold.com&#8221;:support@riverfold.com.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Clipstart 1.1&#8243;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ is out, with support for the iPhone 3GS, YouTube, and more. I&#8217;m really happy with the response I&#8217;ve received so far. The 3GS is such a convenient device for video that even people who weren&#8217;t taking lots of clips before now find themselves with a bunch of videos. That deserves a dedicated management app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ryan Irelan&#8221;:http://ryanirelan.com/ asked me the other day if Clipstart would support a simple email option, for quickly sharing a video with family without uploading to a web site. This is a pretty good candidate for using Clipstart&#8217;s file actions, which allow you to process the selected video files with a script.</p>
<p>I liked how &#8220;Acorn handled this kind of thing&#8221;:http://flyingmeat.com/wikka/AcornExtraScripts, so I essentially lifted its file actions feature directly and put it into Clipstart, even down to the ACShortcutKey shortcut comments. Even though Acorn is for still images and Clipstart for videos, it seemed similar enough that you could conceivably take lightly-modified scripts from one app and use it the other, if they did not deal with the file&#8217;s contents.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the email script that will be included in Clipstart 1.1.1:</p>
<p><tt><font color="gray">#!/usr/bin/osascript</font></p>
<p>on run <font color="green">argv</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; set <font color="green">filepath</font> to item 1 of <font color="green">argv</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; set <font color="green">old_delims</font> to AppleScript's text item delimiters</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {"/"}</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; set <font color="green">path_items</font> to text items of (<font color="green">filepath</font> as text)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; set AppleScript's text item delimiters to <font color="green">old_delims</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; set <font color="green">filename</font> to last item of <font color="green">path_items</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; tell application "Mail"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; set <font color="green">new_msg</font> to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:<font color="green">filename</font>, content:"" &amp; return &amp; return}</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; tell <font color="green">new_msg</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; set visible to true</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; tell content</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; make new attachment with properties {file name:<font color="green">filepath</font>} at after the last paragraph</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; end tell</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; end tell</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; activate</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; end tell</p>
<p>end</tt></p>
<p>Running scripts has been in Clipstart since 1.0. The implementation is pretty simple. I parse the available file action files to extract the executable path and any shortcut keys and modifiers, then dynamically create the menu items. When it&#8217;s time to run an action I use NSTask and friends to execute the program and pass the script file and selected movie path to it.</p>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<p><tt>/path/to/myscript.sh /path/to/movie.avi</tt></p>
<p>Clipstart does it like one of these:</p>
<p><tt>/usr/bin/bash /path/to/myscript.sh /path/to/movie.avi</tt></p>
<p><tt>/usr/bin/osascript /path/to/myscript.sh /path/to/movie.avi</tt></p>
<p>I did this to not require setting +x on the file, but it also seems to be a more convenient way of processing command line arguments when run from osascript.</p>

			<p>You know it has been a good conference when you come back inspired, with ideas and tools to build new things. No surprise that WWDC was like that for me, as it is pretty much every year.</p>
<p>Even before the keynote was over I was getting questions &mdash; which continued all week &mdash; about whether I had iPhone plans. At the very least, Clipstart 1.1 needs to be able to import videos off of the 3GS. &#8220;That&#8217;s in beta now&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/forums/topic.php?id=26. But what about a native phone app?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve convinced myself over the last couple weeks, after listening to what people are doing with their phones and evaluating the existing applications in the App Store, that Clipstart for iPhone would be a very useful app. Video on the 3GS is a big deal. Eventually I can see a new top-level Video category in the App Store, and whoever is in that list is going to do very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neven Mrgan&#8221;:http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/124025728/wwdc-2009 sums up the urgency:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure Phil Schiller&#8217;s prediction of iPhone 3GS quickly becoming the most popular video-capable phone &mdash; if not the most popular consumer video device period &mdash; is right on the money. A message for those working on apps that help us shoot, edit, organize, and share quick, casual video clips: get ready to get busy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit that after WWDC I panicked, thinking for a moment that I had to deliver Clipstart for iPhone immediately, and drop everything I&#8217;m doing to make that happen. I no longer believe that. The Mac version of Clipstart has a lot of potential and I can&#8217;t get too distracted from following up on that. But at the same time I will be expanding what I do on the phone, so we&#8217;ll see where that goes.</p>

			<p>On a previous episode of &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/, number 14, Daniel and I talked about open source. One LGPL tool I use in Wii Transfer is called FFmpeg, a very popular video conversion project that forms the base of many video web sites, as well as the Mac QuickTime component, Perian.</p>
<p>In the latest Wii Transfer I updated to a new version of FFmpeg, which it turns out had a major bug: &#8220;broken audio for 8-bit input sources&#8221;:https://roundup.mplayerhq.hu/roundup/ffmpeg/issue582. Of course I am including the fix in a bug fix update to Wii Transfer (still &#8220;beta in the forums&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/forums/), but not before many customers were hit by the problem.</p>
<p>Not to look a gift horse in the mouth, but it reminds me of one annoyance with FFmpeg: no releases. You basically just follow trunk, and if there&#8217;s a bug, sorry. This is understandable. It&#8217;s open source, after all, and the developers don&#8217;t owe you anything. But at the same time, it&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;ve moved to Perian-only in my new app, and left the FFmpeg trunk and other similar open source command line tool projects behind. With Perian I can track specific major releases and know that someone has tested them. QTKit is good enough now on Leopard that I feel comfortable basing on app on it.</p>
<p>Daniel also mentioned in passing that violators of open source licenses are likely to get away with it. I think that&#8217;s largely true, but I found that the FFmpeg developer base has a pretty keen eye to this issue. If they notice that commercial software is using FFmpeg or MEncoder or other portions inappropriately, they will list the software in their &#8220;hall of shame&#8221;:http://www.ffmpeg.org/shame.html.</p>

<p>Single toolbar (no status bar or need to look in multiple places, e.g. both the top and bottom of the window).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minimal toolbar buttons (only the absolute basics are exposed outside of menus).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opinionated defaults (no customization, similar to others above).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On a few occasions this has hurt my ability to add features, but on others it forces me to see a user interface problem from a new angle, something I wouldn&#8217;t have done if I hadn&#8217;t had these limits to work in.</p>
<p>Limiting features in an app does not come naturally to me, but the more I embrace it, the more value I see in it. I &#8220;tweeted a bonus side effect&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/status/1177252437 to this approach last week: &#8220;Maybe another reason why simple software succeeds: customers see in it all the possible features to come, implemented just right for them.&#8221;</p>

			<p>As I mentioned in my &#8220;Rails rant last week&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/01/rails_4_years_later.html, I have an unhealthy distrust for Rails plug-ins and monkey-patching gems. In addition to often breaking when you upgrade Rails, too many high-level abstractions can make it difficult to understand and debug the code later when things go wrong. For those reasons I will sometimes roll my own solution instead of using someone else&#8217;s. (As an aside, I rarely do this with Mac development, perhaps because I understand the internals of Mac frameworks much better than I do for the Rails core.)</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve just been so impressed with the &#8220;will_paginate&#8221;:http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate plug-in. It&#8217;s fast and there are no obvious compromises &mdash; good out-of-the-box defaults and enough hooks that it can be customized.</p>
<p>If you are doing any Ruby on Rails work and haven&#8217;t checked it out yet, I think you&#8217;ll find that will_paginate is a very elegant solution to something every web app is going to need.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Mike Ash has been rocking with his weekly Friday Q&amp;As. From the &#8220;latest about using private APIs&#8221;:http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/friday-qa-2009-01-02.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Remember that the cost is not just to you, but to your users. If you&#8217;re really unlucky the break will be so bad that it&#8217;s not even obvious that it&#8217;s your fault, and they&#8217;ll figure it out only after much head-scratching. Once they do figure it out, they will hate you if your fix doesn&#8217;t come really fast.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>My new app (not officially announced yet &mdash; more later) currently uses Quick Look as a significant part of the user interface. Quick Look is a private API on 10.5, but my hope was that surely it would be made public by 10.6. If I coded correctly for both cases (I have a 10.6 seed running here I can test against), then I could safely release the product and be reasonably certain that nothing would be break.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now rethinking that, both because it looks increasingly like Quick Look will remain a private API even in Snow Leopard, and because I&#8217;ve gotten feedback that it&#8217;s not a perfect fit for how I&#8217;m using it anyway. At the very least I will turn Quick Look into a secondary option, something that wouldn&#8217;t be missed if it went away, and roll my own preview UI to be the default.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Blog archives don&#8217;t lie. It&#8217;s been nearly 4 years since I first &#8220;blogged about Ruby on Rails&#8221;:http://manton.org/2005/02/the_ruby.html. (Three years and 10 months, but I&#8217;m not patient enough to wait until February to post this.) Here&#8217;s a portion of what I said back then:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But the PHP people will switch, easily, and with the apparent momentum of Ruby right now, maybe it&#8217;s already happening. Forget the enterprise for now. Rails is a perfect fit for anyone who develops for the web on its own terms, and the people behind apps like Basecamp, 43things, and the upcoming Odeo match that profile.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In that time I&#8217;ve increase my use of Rails. At &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ we have a bunch of Xserves running Rails applications. Mac developers have embraced Rails in the form of &#8220;PotionStore&#8221;:http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore. Cheap shared hosts have been replaced with virtual servers, &#8220;many&#8221;:http://www.railsmachine.com/ with an emphasis on Rails hosting.</p>
<p>The community is huge now. What&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<p>Plenty! Here are my top gripes about Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p><em>Deployment</em>. Ask anyone &mdash; even its biggest fans &mdash; and they will complain about deploying Rails applications. This stems from two points: the overhead to initializing a Rails application, meaning multiple instances have to be fired up and ready, unlike PHP which can process a script at a moment&#8217;s notice; and the path of ever-changing deployment strategies littered with the corpses of FCGI, Mongrel, Passenger, Thin, and more.</p>
<p><em>Upgrades</em>. Rails matured quickly and is constantly improving. That&#8217;s great for features, great for best practices, and great for a clean API. The downside is that methods and entire chunks of the framework are deprecated <em>and removed</em> every major release. Forget about backwards compatibility. If you aren&#8217;t reading the blogs and keeping up with the latest changes, you&#8217;ll pay a price when it comes time to upgrade your application.</p>
<p><em>Attitude</em>. David Heinemeier Hansson and the Rails core team have been outspoken in their lack of concern for end users. It&#8217;s because Rails is not actually a product. It was released and is open source to benefit the community and to grow the framework, but average developers should have no misconception that anyone with Git commit access is looking out for their application. I have great respect for Hansson, as well as the other high-profile developers of Rails, but it helps set expectations to underscore that Rails is not a supported product.</p>
<p><em>Java</em>. Developers new to Rails generally come from the two other most popular web development languages: PHP and Java. Many leaders in the community come from that latter group, some of whom I count among my friends. Chad Fowler, in his &#8220;interview with Pragmatic&#8221;:http://www.pragprog.com/podcasts/show/19, spoke to the baggage that developers bring to a new platform. I think some of this baggage from a more &#8220;serious&#8221; architecture is leading to new complex abstractions, such as Capistrano. Whether fair or not, I also largely blame the Java developers for using tabs-as-spaces, which is evil. ;-)</p>
<p><em>Extensibility</em>. The Rails team wisely made a conscious effort to limit the number of features in the core of Rails, instead preferring new optional features to be implemented as gems or plug-ins. The problem is that there are limited hooks to extend the framework. Ruby is great at dynamically extending classes that weren&#8217;t designed with extensibility in mind, but there is no gaurantee that one plug-in&#8217;s monkey-patch will continue to work in future versions. Ironically, &#8220;merging Merb&#8221;:http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/23/merb-gets-merged-into-rails-3 into Rails 3 will bring better supported APIs for plug-in authors while no doubt breaking a bunch of old stuff.</p>
<p><em>Speed</em>. I put this one last because I don&#8217;t actually think it&#8217;s as big of a show-stopper as many people think. Still, it&#8217;s true that Ruby is one of the slowest languages out there, falling behind Python, Perl, PHP, Java, and enormously behind compiled languages. ActiveRecord is great, but it also makes developers lazy and requires tweaking the defaults to achieve the same performance as hand-rolled SQL. Projects like &#8220;Rails Metal&#8221;:http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2008/12/20/performance-of-rails-metal look very cool, though, so that&#8217;s a good sign for the platform.</p>
<p>Even with all these critiques, there is something special about Rails and I will continue to use it for many applications. But at the same time, any shame I used to have at using PHP is gone. <em>If I need to do something simple, I will use a simple solution.</em> As a sort of backlash against my frustrations with Rails, I built everything that powers Riverfold (order processing, admin interfaces, the &#8220;Wii Codes application&#8221;:http://wiitransfer.com/codes/ and Twitter services) off of PHP.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The primary way to track marketing and word-of-mouth about your product is to look at web site referrers. Easy. Just install &#8220;Mint&#8221;:http://www.haveamint.com/ and you&#8217;re done.</p>
<p>But not all referrers are created equal. A prominent link on Digg might lead to sales or it might lead to dozens of &#8220;wish it was free&#8221; comments on your blog. To really judge the effectiveness of referrers (and in turn give a better idea about where resources should be placed in the future) take it one step further to track the initial referrer link all the way through to purchase. You want to know where the customer first learned about your product.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a new idea and I&#8217;m certainly not the first to do it. Wil Shipley spoke at length about this technique during &#8220;his C4 talk&#8221;:http://www.viddler.com/explore/rentzsch/videos/4/ in 2007, in the context of online advertising. In talking with other developers it became clear to me that most people don&#8217;t do this, even though it can be achieved in about a dozen lines of code.</p>
<p>The basics are pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a link comes in to your site, see if a special cookie is set. I called mine &#8220;WiiTransferRef&#8221;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the cookie is set, you have a repeat visitor. Nothing to do at this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the cookie is missing, this user is likely visiting your site for the first time. Put the referrer value in the cookie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a purchase is complete, check for this cookie and add an entry to the database with the referrer value and timestamp for the order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add more intelligence as suits your requirements and available time, but the basics don&#8217;t need to be any more complex than this. For bonus points and slightly improved security, you could add a database entry that tracks the referrer value and use the cookie as a session that simply points to that row, updating the database to show completed orders, but I chose not to do that to keep the database uncluttered.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the PHP source for my main product page:</p>
<pre><code><?php

$val = $_COOKIE['WiiTransferRef'];

$ref = $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'];

if (empty ($val) &#038;&#038; (!empty ($ref))) {

setcookie ("WiiTransferRef", $ref, time() + (3600 * 24 * 30));

}

?></code></pre>
<p>And then the source for the final &#8220;thanks!&#8221; page after a purchase is complete:</p>
<pre><code><?php

$val = $_COOKIE['WiiTransferRef'];

if (!empty ($val)) {

mysql_connect ("db.hostname.com", "user", "pass");

mysql_select_db ("dbname");

$sql = sprintf("INSERT INTO referrers (url, created_at) VALUES ('%s', now())",

mysql_real_escape_string ($val));

mysql_query ($sql);

}

?></code></pre>
<p>Note that because I am using simple PayPal buttons, not all customers actually reach the last page, because they can ignore the &#8220;return to seller&#8221; link after a completed transaction and instead go wherever they chose. This limitation goes away if you have rolled your own store or used something like &#8220;PotionStore&#8221;:http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been tracking these for over a year now. I&#8217;ll share some stats about what I&#8217;ve learned in a future blog post.</p>

			<p>One of worst-kept secrets of &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ is that the movie playback is not as good as what you might see on an Apple TV, Xbox 360, or PS3. I do my best to improve the quality with every release, but let&#8217;s face it: while the Wii is perfectly capable of playing fullscreen video, it stumbles when put to that task inside the Opera web browser through Flash.</p>
<p>In the upcoming version 2.6, I&#8217;ve added the ability to skip directly to any part of a playing movie by clicking on the timeline with the Wii remote. It was frustrating not to be able to do that in previous versions and made it difficult to watch or fast-forward through long movies.</p>
<p>The way many Flash movie players handle skipping is by inserting metadata into the FLV file that contains a map between seconds in the timeline and file positions for the keyframes, and that&#8217;s the way Wii Transfer works as well. Unfortunately this requires rewriting the entire FLV file when post-processing movies. (&#8220;Ian Baird&#8221;:http://blog.skorpiostech.com/ suggested a future optimization would be to store the metadata separately and redo the player to send seconds instead of file offsets to the server.) I was initially using the open source flvtool2.rb to achieve this, but it was extremely slow, so I rewrote it in Objective-C. (Not a port. The Objective-C version was written from scratch and is significantly shorter than the Ruby version in terms of lines of code. It does a little bit less, but it&#8217;s optimized for exactly what Wii Transfer needs.)</p>
<p>This chart shows the performance improvements when processing a couple large movie files. Measured in seconds, so shorter bars are better.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2008/flv_chart.png" alt="FLV chart" border="0" width="506" height="143" /></p>
<p>The other good thing that came out of all this work is that I can now look at a FLV file in a hex editor and not be totally confused. &#8220;Hex Fiend&#8221;:http://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/ was one of the best ways to debug what my code was doing when it failed.</p>
