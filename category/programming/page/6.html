				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>As most Nintendo Wii owners know by now, Mario Kart for Wii shipped last week. I put together yet another friend code database to track and share codes, but this one is unique because it builds on Twitter. Just follow &#8220;@wii&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii and send your friend code in a reply. No registration, no data entry. All your friends on Twitter who also use the system will automatically be linked, so you can quickly get a view of which friend codes to add. It&#8217;s also a great way to discover new Twitter users.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty happy with how the implementation has worked out. It&#8217;s build on essentially three background scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsing replies every minute looking for the friend code pattern (1234-1234-1234 for game codes, with dashes or spaces).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking queued users and pulling everyone they are following into the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generating and caching the RSS feed for recently tweeted friend codes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The system currently only pulls the first 300 followers, but it&#8217;s running smoothly enough that I will bump that up to 500 this week. Over 150 people are currently using it, and the database has about 10,000 records to keep track of friends. I feel like it&#8217;s architected well enough to grow significantly from here, so I may do some casual promotion of the service this week.</p>
<p>If you own a Wii and use Twitter, &#8220;give it a try&#8221;:http://wiitransfer.com/codes/. If you have any questions or feature requests, please send me an email or reply on Twitter. Enjoy!</p>

			<p>There are a few things in this post by &#8220;Ryan Norbauer&#8221;:http://notrocketsurgery.com/articles/2008/02/26/mention-in-wired-piece-on-37signals (via 37signals) that bother me. One is this idea that &#8220;code is meant to be read by humans first and computers only secondarily&#8221;. I understand what he is getting at, but even though I respect new advances in productivity, we have to be very careful to keep our core priorities. There&#8217;s a word for when the balance shifts away from the user and more to us as programmers: selfishness.</p>
<p>Imagine two programs: one is ugly and hard to read, but it compiles and is bug-free; the other is beautiful and readable, and it also compiles and is bug-free. To the user they are identical. They both succeed.</p>
<p>Now take those two and give them both identical beauty and readability, but accidentally break one so that it either does not compile or runs so horribly buggy and slow that it is useless to everyone. Writing code for other programmers to read isn&#8217;t enough. You have to start with code that works before you get all fancy-pants.</p>
<p>This growing trend to raise beautiful code and programmer productivity above the performance or functionality of the final product is dangerous. The final product is what counts. Not how you build it, but what you&#8217;ve built: how it scales, how it performs, how it solves a particular problem.</p>
<p>And sure, there are many times when I write slow, lazy code that doesn&#8217;t work well. But that&#8217;s a compromise you make when you have to meet a deadline, or because you aren&#8217;t sure how to optimize yet, not because you start out by deprecating user experience. If you believe Ryan, it sounds like there is a whole &#8220;movement&#8221; of programmers who toss any potential performance achievements out the window before they even get started.</p>
<p>You can say that great products are complex, and so you need to focus attention on how the software is built and maintained. That is true. When I ported a large application from Carbon to Cocoa a few years ago I made the decision to do so because of future productivity.</p>
<p>You can say that happy programmers create high-quality products. That is also true. When I am feeling most productive I am usually enjoying myself because the work environment I&#8217;m in is encouraging.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t put the <em>practice</em> of software development above the actual result, because to do so means you care more about writing code than solving problems.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;Craig Hockenberry half-joked on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/chockenberry/statuses/770543005 about the iPhone SDK non-disclosure agreement and it reminded me of one of my personal annoyances in the development community: we tend to take NDAs very seriously. I&#8217;ve always been impressed by how Scott Stevenson in particular can write thoughtful articles about Mac software development that go out of their way to tiptoe around unannounced APIs. In his &#8220;latest excellent introduction&#8221;:http://theocacao.com/document.page/558 to the iPhone SDK, there are no less than 3 mentions of the NDA in the original post and comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Until that time, the SDK is under NDA and the apps cannot be distributed to the general public.&#8221; (Scott Stevenson)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The iPhone SDK is very well done (can&#8217;t say more because of the NDA)&#8221; (Florent Pillet)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To answer without getting into NDA stuff, let&#8217;s talk about Mac OS X in general.&#8221; (Scott Stevenson)</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been hit by this community-killer. At WWDC last year I posted to Twitter about new .Mac features and it remains the only tweet I have ever deleted. I had this sudden paranoia that conference staff would kick me out of Moscone and revoke my ADC account. Silly.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s look at reality. Over 100,000 people have downloaded the SDK. This couldn&#8217;t be more different than WWDC, which effectively encourages discussion only while in San Francisco by requiring an investment of at minimum $2-3k between conference, hotels, food, and travel. The SDK by comparison is totally free to download.</p>
<p>Put simply, how can Apple expect us to take an NDA seriously while at the same time they spread the applications and documentation covered under this NDA to every corner of the Mac universe?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a lawyer, but this one seems legally ridiculous. There are a few issues handled by the license:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t distribute apps created with the beta SDK. That&#8217;s fine, because there&#8217;s no good way to do that anyway and giving everyone a level &#8220;June launch&#8221; playing field makes sense for both Apple and developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&#8217;t rip-off Apple&#8217;s ideas and use them in your own phone before the SDK ships. That&#8217;s also fine, because I don&#8217;t care about other phones and generally think Apple already has a insurmountable development platform advantage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&#8217;t talk about confidential capabilities of the SDK. This is the one I have problems with, because I question if something can be considered confidential if it is shared with 100,000 people.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For years Mac developers have asked Apple for an official, closed mailing list to discuss APIs still under NDA. Maybe things would be different now if Apple hadn&#8217;t refused that request, but with a release as mainstream as the iPhone SDK it&#8217;s too late to try to control the conversation. I expect a healthy discussion of APIs and business practices to happen on blogs and Twitter and IRC and email, and that&#8217;s how it should be.</p>

			<p>I love the passion in &#8220;this comment from Wil Shipley&#8221;:http://theocacao.com/comment/5466:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This app is all I&#8217;m working on. My entire reputation, my 25 years in the industry, my company is all riding on this release. I&#8217;m not going to just suddenly give up one day for no reason.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m one of those people who will upgrade to &#8220;Delicious Library&#8221;:http://www.delicious-monster.com/ 2 on the first day and I know I won&#8217;t be disappointed. Although my indie app has a tiny fraction of the users Delicious has, I&#8217;m currently going through the same kind of delays.</p>
<p>After months of quick, focused &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ releases, I decided in November to skip a minor bug fix release and roll up all the outstanding issues into a bigger release with several important user interface improvements. You reach a point in this process where there is no turning back, and for every refinement to the product you see just how much more you could do. I think it&#8217;s that kind of constant, iterative polishing that Wil is going through now.</p>
<p>If you are curious about the business of software development, don&#8217;t miss his &#8220;talk from C4&#8243;:http://www.viddler.com/explore/rentzsch/videos/4/ last year. In many ways I&#8217;m glad it took so long for the videos to go up; I&#8217;ve already forgotten half of the content so it will be fun to review the sessions.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;David Heinemeier Hansson writes in detail&#8221;:http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/21-the-deal-with-shared-hosts on the problems with Rails in shared hosts:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most Rails contributors are not big users of shared hosting and they tend to work on problems or enhancements that&#8217;ll benefit their own usage of the framework. You don&#8217;t have to have a degree in formal logic to deduce that work to improve life on shared hosting is not exactly a top priority for these people, myself included.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve been building Rails apps for a couple years, and will continue to do so, I made the choice with &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ to go PHP-only so that I could deploy on inexpensive shared hosts and easily move my sites. Fact is, you need to dedicate a significant portion of your time to being a system administrator if you run a Rails site.</p>
<p>I find the general &#8220;we don&#8217;t owe you anything&#8221; attitude in the Rails community off-putting. What it means is quite simple: Rails is not a product, despite what it might look like when you &#8220;visit the web site&#8221;:http://www.rubyonrails.com/. This is fine and consistent with the opinionated nature of Rails (which from a design perspective is what makes Rails excellent), but it also means that features like backwards compatibility are not just ignored but actively discouraged. The message this sends is that the core team values their own personal productivity over the productivity of the general Rails userbase.</p>
<p>Also, make no mistake, the performance questions surrounding Rails are directly related to the web shared host issue. Rails can&#8217;t be hosted in the same way that PHP is hosted because it takes so long for a Rails application to be initialized, requiring dedicated long-running app instances and an ever-changing array of &#8220;best practice&#8221; solutions starting with mod_ruby to FCGI to Mongrel to &#8220;Thin&#8221;:http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/.</p>
<p>My friends and &#8220;co-workers&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ are no doubt sick of me bashing Rails (see &#8220;this post on the priorities of the community&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/09/rails_and_mac_dev.html), but I still admire Rails and do want to see these problems solved. I would love to use &#8220;PotionStore&#8221;:http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore to power the Riverfold site, or to base my registration database and sales tracking in Rails.</p>

			<p>Happy Halloween! &#8220;Wii Transfer 2.5.2&#8243;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ is now available. This is probably one of the most difficult bug fix releases I&#8217;ve done. Full changes are in &#8220;the release notes&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/releasenotes/, but the biggest stuff includes fixed Leopard UI glitches and a new 2-pass encoding that should result in much more consistent movie streaming quality. Along the way I touched most of the corners of the product, including many hours of trial-and-error debugging the Flash FLV player component.</p>
<p>While testing Wii Transfer on my TV the other day I had a moment to reflect on how this product has evolved. What started as a one-weekend hack has grown into something quite a bit more complex. It has a few rough edges, sure, but I&#8217;m proud of this little app and how I&#8217;ve been able to put a simple UI on all these different technologies (embedded web server, HTML/JavaScript/Flash UI, MP3 and FLV conversion, iLife integration, etc). I have a few new features planned and in various stages of development, but I think the just-released 2.5.2 is going to start a trend of refinement; there&#8217;s a lot I could do to improve the movie conversion and streaming experience before introducing anything radically new.</p>
<p>So, Leopard. I had originally planned to just wipe my old Leopard seed partition on the MacBook and test the GM, but at the last minute I dove full in and did an upgrade install on my primary machine, the Mac Pro. I have nightly SuperDuper clones just in case, but the upgrade was completely smooth. It&#8217;s a great OS foundation and I can&#8217;t wait to see what other developers have been working on.</p>

			<p>This morning I finally rolled out &#8220;version 2.5 of Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/, the most significant release of the product yet. It probably deserved a 3.0 label slapped on it, but I like how all the 2.x releases revolve around the sharing features (sending movies, music, and pictures to the Wii via the Opera browser). Besides, I have a special set of entirely new stuff planned for 3.0.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new? Movie streaming is the big one. You can now drag and drop movie files to convert to Flash Video format, which Wii Transfer&#8217;s web server will happily stream up to your Wii. It works surprisingly well considering the Wii has such limited memory and no hard drive. Last night I even tested with feature-length movies.</p>
<p>Other new features include background music for picture slideshows (both MP3 and AAC) and bookmark sharing, so that you can browse your Safari or Firefox bookmarks on your Wii to easily visit those sites. The &#8220;release notes&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/releasenotes/ page has more of the details.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also bumped the price up to $19, where I expect it to stay for some time. One way I like to think about the price of Wii Transfer is in relation to another common purchase from Wii owners: games. It&#8217;s still less than half the price of a new Wii game.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the beta testers who provided feedback. There are still a number of things about movie sharing that I&#8217;d like to polish up, so additional minor updates are likely. I often use the &#8220;Wii account on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii to post these and other announcements.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Damon Clinkscales has a write-up&#8221;:http://damonclinkscales.com/past/lone-star-charity-workshop-wrap-up/ of the Charity Workshop that took place before the Lone Star Ruby Conference in Austin a couple weekends ago. I skipped the conference and attended these tutorials instead, enjoying some great talks by Marcel Molina, Bruce Williams, and 6 other speakers all packed into 4 hours. I definitely picked up a few good tips on Ruby blocks and ActiveRecord, but I was not-so-secretly relieved that I didn&#8217;t attend the full conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since brunch on Sunday&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalnomad/1352583178/ after the conference, where I got to hear another wrap-up from co-workers, I&#8217;ve been thinking about why. Why did I sell my RailsConf ticket and book a flight to Chicago for C4 instead? Why skip a cheap Ruby conference practically in my own backyard? Why have I whittled my Ruby-themed blog subscriptions down to just a few from dozens?</p>
<p>Now I know: it&#8217;s about the difference in the communities. The Mac developer community is all about building  unique apps, crafting an excellent user experience, and the &#8220;indie culture&#8221;:http://www.al3x.net/2007/08/c41-friday.html of building something small and useful. The Rails community by contrast seems focused on how few lines of code a controller method is. I&#8217;m lucky to work with people who care about that stuff, because it often does yield better applications, but I just don&#8217;t wake up in the morning excited about rewriting code, so why would I leave my family for a few days to hear someone talk about it?</p>
<p>There are many kinds of programmers. People who have hacked their whole life, dropping out of school to sell software; traditional developers with a CS degree and big company background; and even fine arts majors who fell into programming by accident as a way to build web sites. Based on that background, or what direction their passion takes them, I believe there is a balance between joy for the <em>act of writing code</em> vs. the pride in <em>seeing the final product</em>, and each programmer leans to one way or the other.</p>
<p>For Rails developers, at least many of the leaders in the industry who came from or were inspired by the extreme programming methodology and test-driven development, it&#8217;s the former: the art is found in the lines of code &#8212; how efficient can the logic be, how DRY, how RESTful.</p>
<p>For Mac developers, not just the &#8220;Delicious Generation&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Article/DeliciousGeneration-2006-11-06-10-00 but old school Mac developers as well, it&#8217;s the latter: the art is how the final product looks and behaves &#8212; being inspired to build something simply because you used another application that was great.</p>
<p>Cutting it this way allows me to see two things very clearly that were confusing before. It puts specifics to why I&#8217;ve drifted further away from the Rails cutting edge, and it explains why I get so annoyed with some of the newer crop of Mac developers who proclaim &#8220;bindings&#8221;:http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000080.php and garbage collection as beautiful gifts for programmer productivity even though they have no added value for the user experience.</p>
<p>Rails is a great framework, and I will continue to enjoy switching gears to write web apps in between my Mac projects. But I&#8217;m not going to tune back into that community until there is an equal focus on the bigger picture as it impacts the user (more scaling, more UI best practices), or whatever the next big thing to hit web apps ends up being.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve been using &#8220;Ta-da List&#8221;:http://www.tadalist.com/ for the last couple of years for all my to-do lists. I have about 100 lists and love the speed of adding new items and some of the subtle smarts it applies to sorting recent lists and cleaning up completed ones.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve been on the lookout for a desktop app. OmniOutliner has become a bit bloated and all the Getting Things Done apps seem so structured. Along comes &#8220;TaskPaper&#8221;:http://hogbaysoftware.com/projects/taskpaper today and there&#8217;s a lot to like. The plain text file format is refreshing and nicely open.</p>
<p>I wrote a Ruby script to export all my lists from Ta-da into TaskPaper so that I can give it a proper workout. It makes a new document (with a single project) for each list it finds. Make sure to install &#8220;Hpricot&#8221;:http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/ first &#8212; there&#8217;s no official Ta-da List API so we need to parse HTML a little.</p>
<p>Download: &#8220;tadalist_taskpaper.rb&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/software/scripts/tadalist_taskpaper.rb</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the file in your favorite text editor and change TADALIST_HOST to whatever your account is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure Safari is running and you have logged into Ta-da. The script reads the cookie value from Safari&#8217;s Cookies.plist so that it doesn&#8217;t need to simulate a real sign-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run from the command line. It will create the new files in the current directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will see short status messages for what it is doing. It&#8217;s broken if there are any Ruby exceptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

			<p>From time to time on the &#8220;MacSB list&#8221;:http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/macsb people ask about the value of localization and what percentage of sales come from foreign customers. Since day 1 of &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ I&#8217;ve always been surprised at how many sales are from Europe. At times it felt as if over half of sales were outside the United States, so I finally ran the numbers to know for sure.</p>
<p>My homegrown customer database doesn&#8217;t actually include the physical address, so I grabbed the last 500 sales from PayPal and wrote a quick script to group the countries. Here&#8217;s the chart:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2007/sales_chart_countries.gif" border="0" height="265" width="341" alt="Wii Transfer countries chart" /></p>
<p>The United States represents just over half. If you add up the other English-speaking countries, it hits 70%. Still, this is a purely English-only piece of software. I&#8217;ve resisted the push to localize until I feel the codebase is better prepared for it, and the UI more stable.</p>
<p>At &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ last year I wrote a custom Rails web app to manage localization resources for both the Mac and Windows products and deal with the outsource translators, and the takeaway from that experience was definitely to go slowly. It&#8217;s easy to end up with a foreign language version that makes compromises and is potentially less useful to customers than the English version. Depending on the size of the product, localization could take weeks or months, time that might be better spent adding features.</p>
<p>Back to the real stats. Why are the foreign numbers so high? I think the weak dollar combined with an already relatively inexpensive price makes Wii Transfer even more of an impulse buy in Europe.</p>

			<p>I finally released &#8220;Wii Transfer 2.3&#8243;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ late last night. This is the version I demoed in &#8220;my interview with The Unofficial Apple Weblog&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/18/video-wii-transfer/. The most notable changes are AAC support, an improved music player interface, and better use of the Wii remote buttons.</p>
<p>This release sports a new icon, designed by Jordan Langille of &#8220;OneToad.com&#8221;:http://www.onetoad.com/. As much as I enjoy tinkering with Photoshop and Illustrator, I knew I didn&#8217;t have time to do a quality icon. I wanted something fun that still captured a part of the original icon, and this concept has really grown on me since it was finished almost 2 months ago.</p>
<p>I also took this opportunity to refresh the &#8220;Riverfold web site&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ design a little. Just don&#8217;t tell anyone that it still uses HTML tables.</p>

At VitalSource we also just released &#8220;Bookshelf 4.6&#8243;:http://www.vitalsource.com/index/bookshelf today, which lays the foundation for media-rich textbooks and adds a highlighter rating UI for any subscribed highlighters you have. This data will bubble up in a few places in the future to allow you to discover people and books, although for now it&#8217;s one-way.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a &#8220;short screencast of the rating interface&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/screencasts/2007/bookshelf_rating.mov (12 seconds, 700k). The star widget is a simple Cocoa control that hits a web service in the background. It was fun to write and surprisingly not very much code.</p>

			<p>Brent Simmons, from a &#8220;TUAW interview&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/05/5-questions-with-brent-simmons-creator-of-netnewswire/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One of the things I love about being a Mac developer is getting to meet the folks who make the apps I use. In a way, my /Applications folder is also my social network. Which is cool.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I never thought about it that way, but it&#8217;s definitely a great aspect of the Mac developer community. I hope to add a few more people to my /Applications social network next week at WWDC.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to a bunch of WWDCs now, but I&#8217;m particularly excited this year because it will be the first time I&#8217;ve attended as representing both a &#8220;large-ish company&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ and an &#8220;independent one-man shop&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/.</p>
<p>I will be carrying VitalSource business cards in my wallet, but I also hope to have a printed batch of Wii Transfer serial numbers to hand out. I know a lot of Mac developers have a Nintendo Wii and it&#8217;s a shame I haven&#8217;t given out more copies. If you have a Wii and see me (I look &#8220;something like this&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/me/), please get my attention so that I can correct this oversight.</p>

			<p>Since version 2.0, &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ has had a built-in web server for serving music and photos to the Nintendo Wii. The server was written in Cocoa and the code became very unwieldy as I continued to add features. Dozens of methods for processing different parts of the URL, and many if statements for conditionally branching based on the URL, splitting the URL parameters, and more.</p>
<p>The code looked something like this (only worse):</p>
<pre><code>

if (path startsWithSubstring:@"/albums") {

[self processAlbumsRequest:path];

}

else if (path startsWithSubstring:@"/artists") {

[self processArtistsRequest:path];

}

else {

// ...

}

(void) processAlbumsRequest:(NSString *)inPath

{

// split out the parameters and request extensions from the URL path

// ...

if ([e isEqualToString:"xml"]) {

// ...

}

else if ([e isEqualToString:"html"]) {

// ...

}

}

</code></pre>
<p>Multiply that times 10 for all the different URLs that Wii Transfer knows how to process, and you can see how it worked fine for a couple simple things, but quickly became a mess as I added features.</p>
<p>For the upcoming version 2.3, I redesigned most of the URLs to follow a common structure, patterned after the default URL syntax that Rails uses: /controller/action/id. Now, instead of if statements, I dynamically route the URL requests using NSSelectorFromString() and performSelector:withObject:.</p>
<p>Consider this code (as above, simplified from the real thing):</p>
<pre><code>

// extract the values from /controller/action/id URLs

NSArray* pieces = [[path stringByDeletingPathExtension] pathComponents];

NSString* controller = [pieces objectAtIndex:1];

NSString* action = [pieces objectAtIndex:2];

NSString* param_id = [pieces objectAtIndex:3];

// call a method named controller_action, passing it the id

NSString* sel_name = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@_%@:", controller, action];

SEL method = NSSelectorFromString (sel_name);

[self performSelector:method withObject:param_id];

</code></pre>
<p>Now if I need to invent a new URL, say &#8220;/tracks/play/1234.mp3&#8243;, all I have to do is write the implementation for that method:</p>
<pre><code>

- (void) tracks_play:(NSString *)inParamID

{

// ...

}

</code></pre>
<p>The web request calls through to this new method without any additional glue code, in this case passing &#8220;1234&#8221; in the single parameter.</p>
<p>(The underscored method signatures aren&#8217;t very Cocoa-ish, but this is actually a plus because I can quickly spot the chunk of the controller that processes a set of requests, and I like that they read just like the URLs. I&#8217;m also currently using a single controller instead of having separate controller objects for the different types of requests, but I may expand that later.)</p>
<p>This convention has also allowed me to simplify all the URLs that Wii Transfer uses. Other examples include &#8220;/covers/search/U2&#8243; or &#8220;/artists/show/5&#8243;. I&#8217;ve eliminated a bunch of code, and it fits nicely with how I serve application resources and the start of a HTML template system.</p>
<p>Could it be taken further? Sure. I remember in the Mac OS 9 days building a web interface for a product using only compiled AppleScript scripts stored in the resource fork. Lately, folks like &#8220;Gus Mueller&#8221;:http://gusmueller.com/blog/ and Adobe&#8217;s Lightroom team have been doing interesting things with &#8220;embedding Lua&#8221;:http://www.sqlabs.net/blog/2006/01/adobe-lightroom-and-lua.html. I don&#8217;t want that level of extensibility yet, but it seems like a logical next generation when I outgrow even this new web architecture in Wii Transfer.</p>

			<p>After I &#8220;blogged last month&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/i_hate_domains.html about the very small number of domain names I own, I got some good feedback from people I respect. They basically said: &#8220;You&#8217;re an idiot. Domain names are cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the more I thought about it, the more they were right. So last week I made an offer to buy the wiitransfer.com domain from its current owner, and after just about 48 hours I had the domain and was updating Wii Transfer to use it. Now all registered users can use the simpler bookmark URL wiitransfer.com/username to point to their shared music.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also finally rolling out a bug fix update tonight (version 2.2.1, &#8220;available here&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/). The most important change is that some MP3s that would not play will now work. Some customers never saw this, but for some people a large percentage of their music library was unusable. It turned out to be that certain kinds of embedded cover album artwork in the MP3 would break the Flash player on the Wii. The work-around I used is to load the MP3 into memory and clear all its ID3 tags before sending it over the wire.</p>
<p>It feels good to be working on Wii Transfer again. The next version is already underway and should make a lot of people happy.</p>

			<p>In the tradition of other independent Mac developers such as &#8220;Mike Zornek&#8221;:http://clickablebliss.com/blog/2007/01/08/billable_the_first_100_days/, &#8220;Daniel Jalkut&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/191/lawful-prey, and &#8220;Gus Mueller&#8221;:http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/25.html, I&#8217;m going to share some sales information from the first 75 days of Wii Transfer.</p>
<p>The following chart shows daily sales (in units sold) for each day. I&#8217;ve also highlighted important milestones so you can see what affect they had on sales, such as shipping 2.0 (which brought many links) and increasing the price (from $9 to $14, which brought my first 2.0 day of no sales at all). Finally, there are a few spots where I show the average number of visitors.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2007/sales_75_days.png" width="600" height="220" alt="Sales chart" /></p>
<p>(As an aside, I created this chart in Keynote. I love software that is simple and flexible enough to be used for purposes outside its original developer&#8217;s intentions. I wrote &#8220;more on this subject back in early 2006&#8243;:http://www.manton.org/2006/01/limitations_in_toys.html.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to tell, but the numbers on the right side are on average a little bit higher than the left. Not by much though. Sales just trickle in again right now (a few a day).</p>
<p>So what does it all mean? Here is the basic take-away: Sales are much better than I thought they would be, but not nearly enough to live off of. That&#8217;s okay, because I happen to love &#8220;my day job&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ (also writing Mac software). However, I can definitely see how it would be possible to do this full time, with some real marketing and a collection of several additional applications. I have done zero marketing for Wii Transfer except listing it on MacUpdate, VersionTracker, and Apple&#8217;s download site (where it was featured in the video section).</p>
<p>As you can see, there was a big spike in sales when 2.0 was released. This is a direct result of links from Mac sites like The Unofficial Apple Weblog and Daring Fireball, and gaming sites like Jostiq and others. When traffic goes up, sales go up. This opened my eyes because it really is all about getting your app in front of other users. &#8220;As I blogged about previously&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/wii_transfer_takes.html, I think I also missed some sales opportunities during this period because 2.0 was not very stable.</p>
<p>Other interesting stats: The conversion rate is between 2% and 5%. For every 100 downloads, a few people decide to purchase it. I think many active users probably end up paying for it. Instead of a trial demo period, some features are just crippled, and it isn&#8217;t very usable day-to-day without unlocking the full feature set (for example, with music sharing to the Wii, you can only play one song at a time &#8212; no iTunes playlists or shuffle).</p>
<p>There are at least a few pirates too. I&#8217;m not too worried about them because &#8220;you can&#8217;t stop pirating&#8221;:http://wilshipley.com/blog/2007/02/piracy-reduction-can-be-source-of.html, and most people are honest. One customer was even nice enough to tell me about a pirated serial number he found.</p>
<p>To everyone who purchased Wii Transfer, thanks! When I built 1.0, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I would work on it again. Now, several versions later at 2.2, I have a clear roadmap of features (and bugs!) to keep me busy.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Wii Transfer 2.2 is taking longer to get ready than I had planned, so I&#8217;ve decided to post a public beta while the last pieces are polished up. You can &#8220;grab it from the news section&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ of the Riverfold site (lower right). It is very close to being done, but giant chunks of code have been completely rewritten. I hope the extra testing will help make 2.2 an extremely solid release, and get some of the new features in the hands of users as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new in 2.2? iTunes playlists and several new preferences to control picture sharing top the list, but there are at least a dozen changes underneath the hood.</p>
<p>The web server built into Wii Transfer has seen some work in particular. Music browsing now uses the iTunes Music Library.xml file for everything rather than look at directory contents, and you can change the port number on the fly without restarting Wii Transfer if there is a conflict with any other applications.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also added reflections to the album cover art! You can see a &#8220;screenshot here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/wii_transfer_cover.jpg and another one of &#8220;the collage for playlists here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/wii_transfer_collage.jpg (these are from Safari, but it looks mostly the same on the Wii). This was really fun to do, but unfortunately it somehow introduced a subtle double-release bug that I spent hours fixing. It would only happen if the album art could not be found in iTunes and while multiple connections were hitting the server (i.e. it was ultimately a threading issue), and maybe only every dozen requests.</p>
<p>I tracked it down by using ab (Apache Bench), pointed at Wii Transfer. I had a shell script with a bunch of lines that looked like:</p>
<p><code>ab -n 200 -c 4 "http://localhost:9000/m/Beatles.cover</code></p>
<p>This URL asks Wii Transfer to grab any album art from iTunes for The Beatles, apply the reflection and return the JPEG data. It is flexible because you can send it any search strings. Other examples might be: <code>Evanescence%20Door.cover</code> or <code>Zoo%20Station.cover</code>. I was a little surprised that my little server was actually pumping out pages fairly quickly considering all the AppleScript and Quartz stuff going on. 10-20 requests per second isn&#8217;t much for a real web application, but for an app that is by definition single-user, it&#8217;s perfect.</p>
<p>The reflection code was made even easier by &#8220;BHReflectedImage&#8221;:http://bithaus.com/2006/11/05/nsimage-reflection/, which I modified to work with black backgrounds and then wrapped up in other helper methods to composite the cover and reflection together. When I first ran across this code I didn&#8217;t even notice it was written by Jeff Ganyard, who I&#8217;ve known for years and still run into at WWDC. Thanks Jeff! This goes in the about box credits with a bunch of other mentions. There is a really active Mac developer community that contributes source pretty freely, and I hope to add a few things to that collection one of these day as well.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve blogged a lot about my side project &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ lately, but it&#8217;s time to show my &#8220;real&#8221; job some love as well. Internally at &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ last week we rolled over to beta status for the upcoming Bookshelf 4.5, and I&#8217;m really excited about what is coming. I&#8217;ve been working on the note sharing and syncing feature off and on for over a year now.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s it all mean? In a nutshell, create highlights and notes in your digital textbooks and have them flow to other users or to any of your computers. As Steve Jobs said with a totally straight face at the iPhone introduction: <em>It works like magic.</em></p>
<p>(That was one of my personal favorites from Macworld. Rewatch the keynote and see the expression on his face. This magic is serious stuff.)</p>
<p>At least, magic is the goal. If it was that easy we would have shipped by now. Behind the scenes it gets a little tricky, and the cross-platform C++ code that powers the client (the server piece is written in Ruby on Rails) is in its third major rewrite. Which like all good refactoring, is simpler and probably uses fewer lines of code than the previous two attempts.</p>
<p>But first, some screenshots: &#8220;Subscribed highlights&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/bookshelf_subscribed.png and &#8220;Sharing&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/bookshelf_sharing.png.</p>
<p>The architecture is based on the &#8220;Simple Sharing Extensions&#8221;:http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sse/ (SSE) for RSS and OPML. On top of that we have added a VitalSource namespace and a few extra XML elements and attributes to keep track of Bookshelf-specific data, such as highlighter color and selected text within a book. The goal is to keep it as open as possible, so that in the future we can both consume other sources of user notes, and allow third-parties to also hook into the data in interesting ways.</p>
<p>We (computer users in general) are all writing bits of notes and data in various applications and for the most part, it&#8217;s a mess. We switch applications frequently, databases and file formats change, and there&#8217;s no good way to move data between applications. Imagine instead that you could have bookmarks and short snippets of text easily sync between apps like Del.icio.us, NetNewsWire, Yojimbo, Flickr, and Bookshelf. Ultimately the only requirement is that each item is RSS-like (it has a URI, some text, and maybe another piece of specialized data just for that app). Anyone who has been programming for the web for a few years knows that after a while, <em>everything starts to look like RSS</em>.</p>
<p>The key is simple, flexible standards. &#8220;Less Software&#8221;:http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch10_Less_Software.php, if you will. Mac OS X&#8217;s Sync Services by comparison is too complicated, too closed, and too narrowly tied to specific applications.</p>
<p>What I like best about SSE is that it provides a roadmap of sorts. It makes some assumptions about how you want to sync data and that frees you to work on more important things. Wondering how to deal with GUIDs, versioning, and deletions? Don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel, that&#8217;s in the spec.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post again when we actually ship the software, of course. Anyone else using SSE yet? If so, drop me an email. I&#8217;d love to hear how people are using this stuff.</p>

			<p>Okay, not really. But this has been a crazy and surprising week for my &#8220;little&#8221; application, Wii Transfer. Putting 8 hours each day into &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ (I have a post coming about that tomorrow, by the way) and then juggling home responsibilities, putting out various other fires, and sitting down to work on Wii Transfer until 3am is just not healthy.</p>
<p>Luckily I slept great last night and took a 3-hour nap today. So time to blog again. :-)</p>
<p>Over a week ago I released Wii Transfer 2.0 and made a big mistake, and since I&#8217;ve been programming for the Mac for over a dozen years now, I really should know better. It was buggy. And not just a few minor cosmetic problems, but at least two serious crashers. I simply had not tested enough. It&#8217;s difficult (sometimes impossible) to regain a user&#8217;s trust after their first experience with an application is a bad one, so I got to work that weekend fixing problems and releasing beta builds to customers to get a few extra eyes on the software.</p>
<p>Then Monday came, and <em>all hell broke loose</em>.</p>
<p>Links from &#8220;Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/january#mon-22-wii_transfer, &#8220;Ranchero&#8221;:http://www.ranchero.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=1523, and &#8220;The Unofficial Apple Weblog&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/01/22/wii-transfer-2-0/ were followed by &#8220;Jostiq&#8221;:http://joystiq.com/2007/01/25/wii-transfer-for-mac-os-turns-your-wii-into-a-media-center-but/, &#8220;Infendo&#8221;:http://infendo.com/2007/01/wii-media-center-software.html, &#8220;4 Color Rebellion&#8221;:http://4colorrebellion.com/archives/2007/01/22/wii-transfer-for-mac-reaches-20/, and a bunch of others. Ironically one of the only gaming sites I read that never linked to Wii Transfer was the only one I had actually sent an announcement to (&#8220;GoNintendo&#8221;:http://www.gonintendo.com/). Traffic and sales were way up (&#8220;here&#8217;s a Mint screenshot&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/riverfold_mint.png from one day last week).</p>
<p>But meanwhile, the application was just not that stable. I started rewriting most of the web server inside Wii Transfer and fixing lots of issues with iTunes and iPhoto libraries stored on external drives. Then I made my second mistake: I added a feature (album cover artwork!). Obviously, adding a feature in the middle of bug fixes just delays the original fixes and introduces new problems.</p>
<p>I also quickly realized how many things could go wrong with how music and picture sharing works. It relies on the Nintendo Wii and your Mac being on the same local network. Because Wii Transfer pings a bookmark server to register your IP address, you also have to make sure the app picks the right IP if your Mac is on both ethernet and wireless networks. Worse, many people have the Mac OS X built-in firewall enabled, so users are required to manually open up port 9000.</p>
<p>At one point on Tuesday when sales were coming in, every time I received a PayPal notification email I literally groaned. &#8220;Stop buying this software until I can make it work reliably,&#8221; I would say to the computer. The thing that got me through was that all customers who sent in support email were extremely helpful and patient. The other good news is that with version 2.1.1, it&#8217;s looking pretty solid, and the next update should wrap up any remaining fringe issues.</p>
<p>To everyone who gave Wii Transfer a try, thanks! I think you&#8217;ll like what comes next.</p>
