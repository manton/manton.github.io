			<p>Wii Transfer 2.2 is taking longer to get ready than I had planned, so I&#8217;ve decided to post a public beta while the last pieces are polished up. You can &#8220;grab it from the news section&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ of the Riverfold site (lower right). It is very close to being done, but giant chunks of code have been completely rewritten. I hope the extra testing will help make 2.2 an extremely solid release, and get some of the new features in the hands of users as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new in 2.2? iTunes playlists and several new preferences to control picture sharing top the list, but there are at least a dozen changes underneath the hood.</p>
<p>The web server built into Wii Transfer has seen some work in particular. Music browsing now uses the iTunes Music Library.xml file for everything rather than look at directory contents, and you can change the port number on the fly without restarting Wii Transfer if there is a conflict with any other applications.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also added reflections to the album cover art! You can see a &#8220;screenshot here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/wii_transfer_cover.jpg and another one of &#8220;the collage for playlists here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/wii_transfer_collage.jpg (these are from Safari, but it looks mostly the same on the Wii). This was really fun to do, but unfortunately it somehow introduced a subtle double-release bug that I spent hours fixing. It would only happen if the album art could not be found in iTunes and while multiple connections were hitting the server (i.e. it was ultimately a threading issue), and maybe only every dozen requests.</p>
<p>I tracked it down by using ab (Apache Bench), pointed at Wii Transfer. I had a shell script with a bunch of lines that looked like:</p>
<p><code>ab -n 200 -c 4 "http://localhost:9000/m/Beatles.cover</code></p>
<p>This URL asks Wii Transfer to grab any album art from iTunes for The Beatles, apply the reflection and return the JPEG data. It is flexible because you can send it any search strings. Other examples might be: <code>Evanescence%20Door.cover</code> or <code>Zoo%20Station.cover</code>. I was a little surprised that my little server was actually pumping out pages fairly quickly considering all the AppleScript and Quartz stuff going on. 10-20 requests per second isn&#8217;t much for a real web application, but for an app that is by definition single-user, it&#8217;s perfect.</p>
<p>The reflection code was made even easier by &#8220;BHReflectedImage&#8221;:http://bithaus.com/2006/11/05/nsimage-reflection/, which I modified to work with black backgrounds and then wrapped up in other helper methods to composite the cover and reflection together. When I first ran across this code I didn&#8217;t even notice it was written by Jeff Ganyard, who I&#8217;ve known for years and still run into at WWDC. Thanks Jeff! This goes in the about box credits with a bunch of other mentions. There is a really active Mac developer community that contributes source pretty freely, and I hope to add a few things to that collection one of these day as well.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve blogged a lot about my side project &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ lately, but it&#8217;s time to show my &#8220;real&#8221; job some love as well. Internally at &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ last week we rolled over to beta status for the upcoming Bookshelf 4.5, and I&#8217;m really excited about what is coming. I&#8217;ve been working on the note sharing and syncing feature off and on for over a year now.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s it all mean? In a nutshell, create highlights and notes in your digital textbooks and have them flow to other users or to any of your computers. As Steve Jobs said with a totally straight face at the iPhone introduction: <em>It works like magic.</em></p>
<p>(That was one of my personal favorites from Macworld. Rewatch the keynote and see the expression on his face. This magic is serious stuff.)</p>
<p>At least, magic is the goal. If it was that easy we would have shipped by now. Behind the scenes it gets a little tricky, and the cross-platform C++ code that powers the client (the server piece is written in Ruby on Rails) is in its third major rewrite. Which like all good refactoring, is simpler and probably uses fewer lines of code than the previous two attempts.</p>
<p>But first, some screenshots: &#8220;Subscribed highlights&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/bookshelf_subscribed.png and &#8220;Sharing&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/bookshelf_sharing.png.</p>
<p>The architecture is based on the &#8220;Simple Sharing Extensions&#8221;:http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sse/ (SSE) for RSS and OPML. On top of that we have added a VitalSource namespace and a few extra XML elements and attributes to keep track of Bookshelf-specific data, such as highlighter color and selected text within a book. The goal is to keep it as open as possible, so that in the future we can both consume other sources of user notes, and allow third-parties to also hook into the data in interesting ways.</p>
<p>We (computer users in general) are all writing bits of notes and data in various applications and for the most part, it&#8217;s a mess. We switch applications frequently, databases and file formats change, and there&#8217;s no good way to move data between applications. Imagine instead that you could have bookmarks and short snippets of text easily sync between apps like Del.icio.us, NetNewsWire, Yojimbo, Flickr, and Bookshelf. Ultimately the only requirement is that each item is RSS-like (it has a URI, some text, and maybe another piece of specialized data just for that app). Anyone who has been programming for the web for a few years knows that after a while, <em>everything starts to look like RSS</em>.</p>
<p>The key is simple, flexible standards. &#8220;Less Software&#8221;:http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch10_Less_Software.php, if you will. Mac OS X&#8217;s Sync Services by comparison is too complicated, too closed, and too narrowly tied to specific applications.</p>
<p>What I like best about SSE is that it provides a roadmap of sorts. It makes some assumptions about how you want to sync data and that frees you to work on more important things. Wondering how to deal with GUIDs, versioning, and deletions? Don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel, that&#8217;s in the spec.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post again when we actually ship the software, of course. Anyone else using SSE yet? If so, drop me an email. I&#8217;d love to hear how people are using this stuff.</p>

			<p>Okay, not really. But this has been a crazy and surprising week for my &#8220;little&#8221; application, Wii Transfer. Putting 8 hours each day into &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ (I have a post coming about that tomorrow, by the way) and then juggling home responsibilities, putting out various other fires, and sitting down to work on Wii Transfer until 3am is just not healthy.</p>
<p>Luckily I slept great last night and took a 3-hour nap today. So time to blog again. :-)</p>
<p>Over a week ago I released Wii Transfer 2.0 and made a big mistake, and since I&#8217;ve been programming for the Mac for over a dozen years now, I really should know better. It was buggy. And not just a few minor cosmetic problems, but at least two serious crashers. I simply had not tested enough. It&#8217;s difficult (sometimes impossible) to regain a user&#8217;s trust after their first experience with an application is a bad one, so I got to work that weekend fixing problems and releasing beta builds to customers to get a few extra eyes on the software.</p>
<p>Then Monday came, and <em>all hell broke loose</em>.</p>
<p>Links from &#8220;Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/january#mon-22-wii_transfer, &#8220;Ranchero&#8221;:http://www.ranchero.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=1523, and &#8220;The Unofficial Apple Weblog&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/01/22/wii-transfer-2-0/ were followed by &#8220;Jostiq&#8221;:http://joystiq.com/2007/01/25/wii-transfer-for-mac-os-turns-your-wii-into-a-media-center-but/, &#8220;Infendo&#8221;:http://infendo.com/2007/01/wii-media-center-software.html, &#8220;4 Color Rebellion&#8221;:http://4colorrebellion.com/archives/2007/01/22/wii-transfer-for-mac-reaches-20/, and a bunch of others. Ironically one of the only gaming sites I read that never linked to Wii Transfer was the only one I had actually sent an announcement to (&#8220;GoNintendo&#8221;:http://www.gonintendo.com/). Traffic and sales were way up (&#8220;here&#8217;s a Mint screenshot&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/riverfold_mint.png from one day last week).</p>
<p>But meanwhile, the application was just not that stable. I started rewriting most of the web server inside Wii Transfer and fixing lots of issues with iTunes and iPhoto libraries stored on external drives. Then I made my second mistake: I added a feature (album cover artwork!). Obviously, adding a feature in the middle of bug fixes just delays the original fixes and introduces new problems.</p>
<p>I also quickly realized how many things could go wrong with how music and picture sharing works. It relies on the Nintendo Wii and your Mac being on the same local network. Because Wii Transfer pings a bookmark server to register your IP address, you also have to make sure the app picks the right IP if your Mac is on both ethernet and wireless networks. Worse, many people have the Mac OS X built-in firewall enabled, so users are required to manually open up port 9000.</p>
<p>At one point on Tuesday when sales were coming in, every time I received a PayPal notification email I literally groaned. &#8220;Stop buying this software until I can make it work reliably,&#8221; I would say to the computer. The thing that got me through was that all customers who sent in support email were extremely helpful and patient. The other good news is that with version 2.1.1, it&#8217;s looking pretty solid, and the next update should wrap up any remaining fringe issues.</p>
<p>To everyone who gave Wii Transfer a try, thanks! I think you&#8217;ll like what comes next.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I finished &#8220;Wii Transfer 2.0&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ late Thursday night. This version is an interesting milestone for the application because it goes beyond just using the SD card to shuttle data back and forth between your Mac and Wii. There is a small Cocoa web server embedded inside Wii Transfer that can serve up MP3s and JPEGs directly to the Wii using the Internet Channel. I think this could be the basis for some really fun stuff in the future.</p>
<p>One of the things I added at the last minute is to try to simplify how you connect to your Mac from the Wii. IP addresses are difficult to memorize for most people and may change depending on how your home network is setup. To solve this, Wii Transfer will optionally create a permanent URL for you on bookmark.riverfold.com. You can then add that URL as a favorite for your Wii and it will always redirect to your local machine. Wii Transfer will ping the Riverfold server on startup and update the bookmark database with your current IP address. You can think of it as a simplified version of &#8220;Dynamic DNS&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS.</p>
<p>I just noticed that Wii Transfer is the featured download and staff pick in the &#8220;video section of Apple&#8217;s download site&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/video/. That is a nice surprise. It will be interesting to see what that does to download stats.</p>
<p>One last thing. Starting next month the price will go up to $14 for version 2.0 (free upgrade for all existing users). I usually work on Wii Transfer at night, so the increase will help offset all the sleep I lost. :-) Even at $14 it may be underpriced. Remember the &#8220;Brent Simmons rule&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/168/the-price-is-wrong: anything less than $20 won&#8217;t be taken seriously. In this case though I think it&#8217;s just about right. I&#8217;m also finding a large percentage of purchases from Europe, despite no localization, probably because the US dollar is so weak now. Enjoy!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>A few years ago I used &#8220;VoodooPad Lite&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/ extensively. Every note, to-do list, and feature description went into it. At some point I migrated away from VoodooPad to a combination of text files and &#8220;Ta-da list&#8221;:http://www.tadalist.com/, perhaps fearing I would have too much data in a weird format that would be difficult to get at later.</p>
<p>But I was always on the lookout for a problem that would best be solved with VoodooPad again. With our localized help files for &#8220;Bookshelf 4.1&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/, I tried for most of a day to use VoodooPad to manage the help. I even experimented with Gus&#8217;s dead &#8220;project for remote wiki editing&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi?space=3ec82d22-c72a-01d9-1639-c0cbe4c4c32b, thinking I would write my own web-based help-specific wiki system and plug &#8220;Boomerang&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi/348c223e-0512-01da-1c41-c0cbe4c4fc75 into it. In the end it was too difficult to force the existing static help files into VoodooPad.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to a few nights ago. &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ 1.5 has no Apple Help at all, and it needs some. A perfect opportunity for VoodooPad, and I&#8217;m happy to report that the solution works beautifully. I knew I could make it work because clearly VoodooPad&#8217;s own help files are managed with VoodooPad. After a bit of experimentation I bought a new VoodooPad license and all was well in the world.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>I manage the help content in VoodooPad, creating pages for different help sections and generally just typing away and getting stuff done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HTML export template lives inside the VoodooPad document itself, so everything is in one place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also inside the VoodooPad document is a post-processing script (written in Ruby) that looks for a comment in index.html and inserts the appropriate AppleTitle and AppleIcon meta tags that Apple Help needs to get its work done.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The only part I haven&#8217;t finished yet is that the script should also send the files off to Help Indexer to update the search index. I coded that part but it doesn&#8217;t work yet &#8212; there is something different about how VoodooPad executes these scripts that prevents other applications from launching. (Maybe. I&#8217;ll sort it out eventually.)</p>
<p>You can &#8220;watch a screencast of the process here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/screencasts/2007/voodoopad.mov. I add a new page, enter some filler text, export the VoodooPad document, then re-run the Xcode project and view the changes in Apple Help. Fun!</p>

			<p>I got sick (the flu?) shortly after Christmas, but nevertheless managed to sneak in some coding on Wii Transfer 2.0, which I hope to release this weekend. The big new feature for 2.0 is music and picture sharing. Essentially, there is a web server built into Wii Transfer. You can use the Wii&#8217;s Opera web browser to connect directly to your Mac running Wii Transfer and pull up MP3s or iPhoto albums. I&#8217;ve licensed &#8220;Jeroen Wijering&#8217;s Flash-based tools&#8221;:http://www.jeroenwijering.com/ for listening to MP3s and browsing photos. The interface isn&#8217;t perfect yet (the buttons should be bigger for easy TV viewing), but I think it&#8217;s pretty good for a first shot at this. The web server portion is based off of &#8220;J&#252;rgen Schweizer&#8217;s Cocoa example code&#8221;:http://culturedcode.com/cocoa/.</p>
<p>&#8220;Check out this screencast&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/screencasts/sharing.mov to see what most of it looks like. The first part shows the new Wii Transfer main window UI with a source list for switching features, and the second part shows what it looks like from the actual Wii. I just setup a tripod and filmed off the new HDTV with my digital camera.</p>
<p>I also started back on &#8220;real work&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ today. We have some neat stuff shipping later this month that I&#8217;ll be blogging about more once it&#8217;s ready to show. I knew I could easily get lost in inconsequential stuff on the Tuesday after a long break, so I spent a bit of time yesterday reviewing to-do lists and getting my head on straight. Got some real coding and design done today, so no complaints there either.</p>
<p>All in all, 2007 is starting off great. (Except that I still seem to be sick, but I&#8217;m going to try to ignore that for a bit longer.)</p>

			<p>&#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ is now listed as part of the &#8220;MacSanta promotion&#8221;:http://www.macsanta.com/. Only $7 through Christmas day!</p>
<p>I also released Wii Transfer 1.5 late last night. The major change in this version is support for automatically backing up saved game data files from an SD card. The Nintendo Wii by default does not save games to SD cards, but it&#8217;s easy in the Wii settings interface to copy your saved games to an SD card or restore later. If Wii Transfer is running when you insert an SD card into your Mac, it will automatically copy the saved games to your hard drive (in Application Support), organizing them by date. Then there&#8217;s a simple UI for restoring the games back to an SD card. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a short screencast&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/screencast_backup.mov if you are curious what it looks like.</p>
<p>One neat part of this that I was able to do &#8212; and this is consistent with the whole point of Wii Transfer, improving the experience of transferring Wii data &#8212; is to show the real game names in the restore list. The data files actually use a 4-character code, but &#8220;WiiSave.com&#8221;:http://www.wiisave.com/ is maintaining a list of codes to real names. I&#8217;ve baked a portion of that list into Wii Transfer 1.5, and the application also automatically downloads an updated list from the Riverfold web site so that as new games are released, Wii Transfer will know about them.</p>
<p>Now head over to &#8220;MacSanta&#8221;:http://www.macsanta.com/ and pick up some great Mac applications, all 20% off.</p>

			<p>I guess it&#8217;s a sign I&#8217;m not blogging very often when I don&#8217;t even announce my own product! A big thanks to &#8220;Dan Benjamin&#8221;:http://hivelogic.com/ and &#8220;John Gruber&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/ for linking up &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/, a little application I quietly rolled out last night. (I&#8217;d thank the other links too but I&#8217;m still sorting through referrers for today. Maybe it&#8217;s time to buy &#8220;Mint&#8221;:http://www.haveamint.com/.)</p>
<p>Wii Transfer started as a weekend hack to make the process of converting QuickTime movies to more Wii-friendly codecs much smoother. Not many hours into it I realized there are a bunch of useful features I could build around the Wii. Rather than work on it for a few months leading up to a big 1.0 release (all the while not knowing if it would be well-received), I borrowed a little &#8220;less software&#8221;:http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch02_Build_Less.php and brought it to the point that it was generally useful and worth paying for.</p>
<p>This kind of quick iteration is great because it means tonight I can announce version 1.2. There are a handful of minor improvements, but the two big new features are AppleScript support and an interface for quickly opening video podcasts from iTunes.</p>
<p>Overall this has been a really fun process and I&#8217;m interested to see where it goes from here. I will write more about Riverfold, the company, in a later blog post.</p>

			<p>C4 was last weekend and looked like a lot of fun. Unfortunately I was about travelled-out this year with RailsConf and WWDC. Perhaps next time.</p>
<p>Daniel Jalkut was the first I saw with nice write-up. He provides &#8220;a speed-through of sessions&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/213/c4-abridged and closes with what is probably the biggest draw for attendees:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As inspiring and as much fun as the scheduled speakers were, the unstructured social time both between sessions and in the evenings were just as much fun, and probably just as educational.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I subscribe to a couple dozen Mac developer blogs, and keeping an eye on Flickr and Technorati tags for C4 is another great way to see what developers are up to. Mr. Rentzsch himself has a &#8220;set of links here&#8221;:http://rentzsch.com/c4/zeroLinkage, and Mike Zornek just posted some &#8220;short videos of the room&#8221;:http://clickablebliss.com/blog/2006/10/25/c4_photos_and_movies/ that give another view of the show.</p>
<p>When I go back through my older Mac programming posts, I&#8217;m reminded that I don&#8217;t really blog about Mac development as much as I used to. Perhaps that is because there are so many other good Mac guys blogging now.</p>

			<p>WWDC 2006 was great. (Yes, it was two weeks ago. Finally making time to blog again.)</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t dwell on the announcements too much, but I generally agree with some that there was nothing earth-shattering. We have only seen a part of what Leopard will become (an improved Finder and some unification of window and control types seem inevitable). The most exciting stuff is new APIs for developers, not flashy end-user features.</p>
<p>I had a great time hanging out, catching up with people and meeting new folks too. Buzz Anderson&#8217;s &#8220;Monday night party&#8221;:http://weblog.scifihifi.com/2006/07/23/party-time-excellent/ was excellent.</p>
<p>In addition to the new Leopard goodness (hello Core Animation and Interface Builder), I also came back with new excitement for a side project that I have been working on: an email client. I had stopped active development until hearing what Apple had planned for Mail.app in Leopard, but now I can safely say that they are going in a completely different direction than what I want to focus on.</p>
<p>Threads like &#8220;this one on Hawk Wings&#8221;:http://www.hawkwings.net/2006/08/21/can-mailapp-cope-with-heavy-loads/ (via &#8220;Steven&#8221;:http://stevenf.com/mt/2006/08/big_mail.php) also confirm that there are a number of users out there who want the same kind of things I want in an email client. Of course it has to be fast and scale, but I think I have a few twists on the old formula as well.</p>
<p>In San Francisco we also stayed an extra day and visited the Oakland museum, drove up to Point Reyes, and saw a great musical Friday night: &#8220;Putnam County Spelling Bee&#8221;:http://www.spellingbeethemusical.com/. I recorded a bunch of audio for an upcoming podcast, although not as much as I probably should have. There were a few times in particular I wish I had taken my microphone out.</p>

			<p>Last year I started some extra work to help bring <a href="http://www.digicelinc.com/">DigiCel FlipBook</a> to the Mac. FlipBook is software for traditional, hand-drawn animators, and it is actually somewhat unique in the industry. Whereas Flash and Toon Boom are vector-based, FlipBook started life as pencil test software for paper-based workflows. It supports scanning with peg hole auto-registration, camera capture, or drawing with a Wacom tablet.</p>
<p>Customers had been asking for a Mac version for a while, but the initial port from Windows to the Mac was not quite ready. It was missing QuickTime support for import, export, and video capture, and the Win32 compatibility layer was somewhat of a roadblock to a polished Mac product.</p>
<p>I entered the project and ended up re-architecting the application to have a more Mac-like appearance. Instead of using the Win32 library, I wrote a lightweight MFC implementation entirely in Cocoa. MFC is Microsoft&#8217;s C++ framework, still widely used even with .NET and C# pushed for new applications. This approach allowed the application to be driven almost purely from Win32 and MFC, but it uses NIBs for all windows and controls because the compatibility framework sits at a much higher level. In several places the Windows code peeks through, but it provides enough flexibility that more and more of the application could be upgraded to a modern Mac look and feel while still sharing a common Windows codebase.</p>
<p>The idea is that by working at the MFC level instead of Win32, you can get by with implementing only a very small subset of the full Microsoft frameworks. If the app only uses a few basic control types, for example, you only need to wrap those onto their Cocoa counterparts and can ignore everything else. (Otherwise you end up rewriting <em>all</em> of Win32 just to load and run the unmodified MFC sources.) Even with that simplification, though, the truth is that I seriously underestimated how much work this would be.</p>
<p>The stack for this ends up looking something like this:</p>
<p><center><img src="../../../images/2006/flipbook_diagram.gif" width="543" height="263" border="0" alt="FlipBook diagram" /></center></p>
<p>It has been an interesting project, both for the technical challenges and because animation is near to my heart. I plan to use the software in my own personal film projects. Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/203490170/">screenshot of the latest version</a>.</p>

			<p>I write Mac software, but over the last year I&#8217;ve increasingly been building Ruby on Rails web apps as well. Today I finally took a look at &#8220;RubyCocoa&#8221;:http://www.rubycocoa.com/. I wanted to whip up a quick Cocoa app that would involve some text parsing, and a dynamic scripting language like Ruby is a much better fit for text processing than C, C++, or Objective-C.</p>
<p>It turns out RubyCocoa works amazingly well. I have only scratched the surface with a small test app, but I was blown away by its ease-of-use, Xcode integration, example projects, and apparent maturity. You have full access to AppKit from Ruby-based controllers and views, and a single NIB file can even reference both Objective-C and Ruby classes. Fantastic stuff.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s ready for commercial software use yet. For distribution, I tested including the RubyCocoa.framework inside the application package and the app launches and runs correctly on a system without the full RubyCocoa install. There may be issues with requiring a recent version of Ruby, but otherwise it&#8217;s a fully native app.</p>
<p>My only disappointment was in the Objective-C calling conventions. There are two versions to choose from: a style using underscores to separate named values, and a slightly easier Ruby syntax using symbols and extra parameters. Here they are:</p>
<p><em>Objective-C:</em></p>
<p><code>[my_window setFrame:r display:YES animate:YES]</code></p>
<p><em>Ruby Underscores:</em></p>
<p><code>my_window.setFrame_display_animate(r, true, true)</code></p>
<p><em>Ruby Symbols:</em></p>
<p><code>my_window.setFrame(r, :display, true, :animate, true)</code></p>
<p>In my opinion, a better approach would be to take advantage of Ruby&#8217;s trick of allowing the last parameter to be a hash supplied without the curly braces. This feels more readable to me and more closely matches the Objective-C equivalent.</p>
<p><em>Better:</em></p>
<p><code>my_window.setFrame(r, :display => true, :animate => true)</code></p>
<p>In any case, that&#8217;s a minor complaint and doesn&#8217;t take much away from the beauty of writing native Mac apps in Ruby.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Gillian Carson talks about vacation time&#8221;:http://www.barenakedapp.com/misc/vacation-time on the Amigo blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A holiday is a time for thinking, for relaxing your mind, for drinking beer and laughing and&#8230; for having ideas. The last time we went on holiday we came up with the idea for Carson Workshops, so I have great faith in letting your brain run free.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. Late last night I was working on a problem, something I had been struggling with in my spare time for a couple of weeks. I went back and forth between staring at an empty text editor and reading NetNewsWire. In other words, wasting time. I went out after midnight to get some milk and food for breakfast, and on the drive to the store I let my mind wander until my brain randomly struck upon an elegant solution to my coding problem. Back at my desk I implemented it in 10 lines of code and went to bed.</p>
<p>Have a happy July 4th everyone.</p>

			<p>I had a busy week coding. Long days and longer nights. Deadlines are fast approaching. The last few weeks of a project are always the most stressful, but also the most rewarding as all the pieces start to fall into place. The user interface tightens up and the bugs are found and worked out.</p>
<p>I shut my computer off last night and didn&#8217;t look at it again. Spent a great morning out shopping and at lunch. It&#8217;s a lazy Saturday afternoon &#8212; a holiday weekend, even &#8212; but I have a bit more code to knock out. The new Dixie Chicks CD is playing, iChat is safely in the &#8220;off&#8221; position, and for another hour or so, everything in the world is just fine.</p>

Founders <a href="http://www.damonclinkscales.com/">Damon</a>, Robert Rasmussen, and <a href="http://www.nonewmessages.com/">Rob Jones</a> have done a great job getting the group off the ground and lining up interesting topics.</p>
<p>Last night was our fourth meeting. <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/batate/">Bruce Tate</a> gave a talk on his experience ramping up a Rails team and comparisons to the Java world. As a new experiment on the agenda, afterwards some of us stuck around to hack together a member directory for the web site. I didn&#8217;t actively participate in the coding efforts, but I had a good time meeting new people. As usual, it was all followed by drinks at Hickory Street Bar &amp; Grill, where topics of discussion ranged from refactoring to Perl to C++ windowing toolkits to AppleGuide. You know there&#8217;s some real substance to Rails when it brings together such a diverse group.</p>
<p>Also just announced: the <a href="http://www.austinonrails.org/articles/2006/02/21/austin-on-rails-happy-hour-at-sxsw">Rails Happy Hour at SXSW</a>. Should be fun.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been living in <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> quite a bit over the last few days. It&rsquo;s a great app, well designed and very fast. But it suffers from a problem that iChat and other AIM clients do not have: it&rsquo;s easy to forget about a chat room while working on something else because there&rsquo;s no audio or visual notification that you missed a message.</p>
<p>I whipped up a tiny AppleScript that monitors the chat and beeps if there have been any changes. It&rsquo;s simple but it works fine for me, and should make do until someone writes a full WebKit-based Campfire client app with more options, or until 37signals releases a supported public web services API.</p>
<p>Requirements and how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires Safari. Does not work with Firefox or Camino.</li>
<li>Campfire must be in its own web browser window, or the front tab in any window.</li>
<li>Every 2 seconds, it grabs the HTML from the &lt;div&gt; that Campfire uses for the chat messages. If it has changed since the last time, it beeps.</li>
<li>Only beeps if Safari is not the frontmost application.</li>
<li>If you are in multiple chat rooms, only works if they are in their own window and visible on screen.</ul>
<p>Download: <a href="../../../software/scripts/Campfire_Beep.dmg">Campfire_Beep.dmg</a> (90K)</p>
<p>Just open the application in Script Editor to edit it. Or view the <a href="../../../software/scripts/Campfire_Beep.html">full source</a>.</p>
<p>Comments? Email <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">manton@manton.org</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> I updated the script so that it doesn&#8217;t display errors, more correctly identifies URLs, and supports multiple open Campfire chat windows.</p>
<p><b>This just in:</b> 37signals added sound notification to Campfire today! So this little AppleScript is officially obsolete. I&#8217;d like to take credit for convincing them that such a feature was needed, but we all know how they love to build features that won&#8217;t roll-out until the 2nd week after launch. :-)</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;ve heard it countless times: Before you spend any time optimizing, profile your code. And yet we always think we know where the performance problems are without testing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I started some extra work to help a company port their Windows software to the Mac. It turned into a large project, and when the app ships I will write more about it here. But for now let&rsquo;s just say that it involves a lot of Windows bitmaps.</p>
<p>Performance had been a problem almost from the start. It is a very drawing-intensive application, and I spent time optimizing the path to Quartz. Eventually everything goes through a CGImage, but there is some overhead getting there. I knew more could be done.</p>
<p>Eventually I bothered to run Shark on it. Within 30 seconds it revealed that almost 50% of the application time was being spent inside CGContextSelectFont, which was called very frequently for the very basic text drawing that was needed. I had not even suspected that code. I rewrote it to use ATSUI and all the performance problems immediately melted away. And it wasn&rsquo;t even optimized ATSUI &#8212; just brain-dead create a text layout, font size, and draw.</p>
<p>It was not obvious to me that CGContextSelectFont would be so slow, so I&rsquo;m posting this one for Google to pick up. Happy coding!</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.damonclinkscales.com/">Damon</a> and I have been discussing how time constraints can encourage creativity. I hinted at this in <a href="../../../2005/11/10302_words.html">my first NaNoWriMo post</a>, and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been trying on other projects at work. Of course the concept is all through <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/constraints_breed_breakthrough_creativity.php">what 37signals is doing</a>.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago there was a web application I wanted to write. I estimated it would take a couple of weeks to knock in the basic functionality. A small project, but big enough that it would have to be juggled with other priorities. And the requirements would need to be discussed with other members of the team, which might mean a quick death at the hands of committee-led design.</p>
<p>Encouraged by <a href="http://del.icio.us/willie">Willie</a> over that weekend, we said let&#8217;s just do it and see what happens. Monday morning I asked myself: could I implement most of the application&#8230; <i>before lunch?</i> Because if I couldn&#8217;t, the project would still probably be sitting at zero lines of code. Luckily the app was a simple discussion system, and Rails was a particularly good fit for it.</p>
<p>In the latest The Writing Show podcast, <a href="http://www.wynia.org/wordpress/2005/12/06/the-writing-show-interviews-me-podcast/">J Wynia</a> talks about why NaNoWriMo works. He said the biggest problem writers are faced with is the blank page. NaNoWriMo forces you to start writing immediately, because otherwise you won&#8217;t have a chance of finishing 50,000 words in a month. And something magic happens when you&#8217;ve written the first sentence: before you know it stories and characters are flowing and you&#8217;ve got a half dozen pages or more. If you waited until the first page of the novel had been fully thought out in your mind, you&#8217;d still be looking at a blank page.</p>
<p><a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/creativity_on_s.html">Kathy Sierra wrote about creativity on speed</a>, but I take issue with part of her post. I see speed in development work (C++, Ruby, whatever) as a good thing when it forces you to do something you would not otherwise be able to do because the task was too daunting. But speed in art is something else entirely. The latter is the whole subject of Betty Edwards&#8217; classic book Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. The idea is that by working quickly (gesture drawing, for example), you draw on instinct and what you are seeing, and less on what you think you know about how something looks.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to this concept in animation through the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?tag=mantonorg&amp;keyword=Shamus+Culhane&amp;mode=books">books of Shamus Culhane</a>. It resonated with me immediately not just because I knew it was true &#8212; it matched my own experience with life drawing &#8212; but because he first discovered this while working on an old 1930s Mickey and Pluto short (Hawaiian Holiday) that I remember fondly as a kid (I still have the VHS copy). In some ways the high-speed drawing technique works even better in animation because you are already talking about time. The faster you work the closer the process itself resembles the final product on screen.</p>
<p>While building software is definitely an art &#8212; especially the process of crafting the user interface, or just bootstrapping an idea from nothing through brainstorming &#8212; I don&#8217;t think programming benefits from speed in the same way that art does. With software development the main benefit you get from working fast is breaking through roadblocks, simplifying, and getting things done. The creativity is a result of forcing yourself to think of things in a new way.</p>

			<p>I don&#8217;t consider myself a perfectionist. In fact, I can often be downright lazy. I write sloppy code sometimes. I am hasty with my artwork instead of thorough. I am always impatient to see the end result, regardless of what I am doing. (Oh, and my office is usually a mess.)</p>
<p>But when it comes to things that really matter, I have pretty high standards. When focused I can solve problems well and my attention to detail usually pays off. I am self-critical, which means I can improve.</p>
<p>I attended a Tufte talk earlier this year, and one thing that struck me was how dedicated he is to perfection. He phrases it in a different way, though, less assuming. &#8220;Do no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>When creating something &#8212; art, code, prose &#8212; there is an immediate personal attachment to that thing. Not only is it difficult to see mistakes in it, it seems almost impossible to throw it out and start again. But you have to. The trick is to see the investment in time not as wasted, but as a necessary first step in getting to the final place.</p>
<p>Write half the novel and then rip it apart, let go of the parts that you know aren&#8217;t working and try again. Refactor, redesign, redraw.</p>
<p>One of the revolutions at Disney in the 30s and 40s wasn&#8217;t just incredible talent, it was things like paying the extra money to film pencil tests, so that animators could see their work as it would appear on screen and fix mistakes instead of shipping it off blindly to the distributor. No one else was doing that because it didn&#8217;t seem to make business sense. That is, until you saw the improved results. (Software usability testing is a lot like that, too.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.animated-news.com/archives/00003772.html">recent interview with Animated News</a>, Andreas Deja talks about Walt and his high standards:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to inspired by Walt and what he did, and his standards. He just had these high standards, he would just give the audience something that they didn&#8217;t expect, that was beyond what they thought they would get, always aiming higher. And that&#8217;s one of his traits, that&#8217;s something to really shoot for, to go the extra mile, do even better than people would expect of you. I think it goes along with being a good artist, you&#8217;re never satisfied. It&#8217;s never good enough. That&#8217;s just the way it is. I think with that attitude you learn.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And with that, I&#8217;m off to create something instead of sleeping.</p>

			<p>One of our big projects at work just launched: the <a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/betterbooks/">VitalSource Store</a>. James Duncan Davidson and Mike Clark have posted about what it was like working on this project. My favorite posts include <a href="http://blog.x180.net/2005/07/rails_sandbox_d.html">this one about the Rails development sandbox</a>, and <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2005/07/12#ProduceConsumeXML">this one about RESTful web services</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irelan.net/becoming/past/2005/08/16/this-is-the-part-where-i-get-to-talk-about-my-job/">Ryan also chimed in</a> earlier this week about the project. It feels good to write about work in this space for me too, something I have rarely done but will likely do more as our company becomes well known.</p>
<p>Although the software is now freely available like iTunes, we&rsquo;ve all been hard at work on this stuff for a while now. In fact the current Mac and Windows clients started life over 4 years ago, and there is a bunch of shared code in there from our internal tools that is older still. We&rsquo;ve been shipping product to customers the whole time, but it feels good to now open things up to anyone.</p>
<p>If you look below the surface, there is a pretty incredible foundation that we can build good stuff on top of. Comments like <a href="http://www.anarchogeek.com/articles/2005/08/18/vitalsource-bookshelf-itunes-for-ebooks">this one from Anarchogeek</a> hit on exactly what we are trying to do:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s amazing to me is how the vital bookshelf is a slick mix of a web / desktop application. It uses html, javascript, and css, but it also uses native windows and interface elements. It&rsquo;s very nicely done.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to everyone who is posting their thoughts. You can see more by <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/vitalsource">searching Technorati for VitalSource</a>.</p>
