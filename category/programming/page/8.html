			<p>I had a busy week coding. Long days and longer nights. Deadlines are fast approaching. The last few weeks of a project are always the most stressful, but also the most rewarding as all the pieces start to fall into place. The user interface tightens up and the bugs are found and worked out.</p>
<p>I shut my computer off last night and didn&#8217;t look at it again. Spent a great morning out shopping and at lunch. It&#8217;s a lazy Saturday afternoon &#8212; a holiday weekend, even &#8212; but I have a bit more code to knock out. The new Dixie Chicks CD is playing, iChat is safely in the &#8220;off&#8221; position, and for another hour or so, everything in the world is just fine.</p>

Founders <a href="http://www.damonclinkscales.com/">Damon</a>, Robert Rasmussen, and <a href="http://www.nonewmessages.com/">Rob Jones</a> have done a great job getting the group off the ground and lining up interesting topics.</p>
<p>Last night was our fourth meeting. <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/batate/">Bruce Tate</a> gave a talk on his experience ramping up a Rails team and comparisons to the Java world. As a new experiment on the agenda, afterwards some of us stuck around to hack together a member directory for the web site. I didn&#8217;t actively participate in the coding efforts, but I had a good time meeting new people. As usual, it was all followed by drinks at Hickory Street Bar &amp; Grill, where topics of discussion ranged from refactoring to Perl to C++ windowing toolkits to AppleGuide. You know there&#8217;s some real substance to Rails when it brings together such a diverse group.</p>
<p>Also just announced: the <a href="http://www.austinonrails.org/articles/2006/02/21/austin-on-rails-happy-hour-at-sxsw">Rails Happy Hour at SXSW</a>. Should be fun.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been living in <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> quite a bit over the last few days. It&rsquo;s a great app, well designed and very fast. But it suffers from a problem that iChat and other AIM clients do not have: it&rsquo;s easy to forget about a chat room while working on something else because there&rsquo;s no audio or visual notification that you missed a message.</p>
<p>I whipped up a tiny AppleScript that monitors the chat and beeps if there have been any changes. It&rsquo;s simple but it works fine for me, and should make do until someone writes a full WebKit-based Campfire client app with more options, or until 37signals releases a supported public web services API.</p>
<p>Requirements and how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires Safari. Does not work with Firefox or Camino.</li>
<li>Campfire must be in its own web browser window, or the front tab in any window.</li>
<li>Every 2 seconds, it grabs the HTML from the &lt;div&gt; that Campfire uses for the chat messages. If it has changed since the last time, it beeps.</li>
<li>Only beeps if Safari is not the frontmost application.</li>
<li>If you are in multiple chat rooms, only works if they are in their own window and visible on screen.</ul>
<p>Download: <a href="../../../software/scripts/Campfire_Beep.dmg">Campfire_Beep.dmg</a> (90K)</p>
<p>Just open the application in Script Editor to edit it. Or view the <a href="../../../software/scripts/Campfire_Beep.html">full source</a>.</p>
<p>Comments? Email <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">manton@manton.org</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> I updated the script so that it doesn&#8217;t display errors, more correctly identifies URLs, and supports multiple open Campfire chat windows.</p>
<p><b>This just in:</b> 37signals added sound notification to Campfire today! So this little AppleScript is officially obsolete. I&#8217;d like to take credit for convincing them that such a feature was needed, but we all know how they love to build features that won&#8217;t roll-out until the 2nd week after launch. :-)</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;ve heard it countless times: Before you spend any time optimizing, profile your code. And yet we always think we know where the performance problems are without testing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I started some extra work to help a company port their Windows software to the Mac. It turned into a large project, and when the app ships I will write more about it here. But for now let&rsquo;s just say that it involves a lot of Windows bitmaps.</p>
<p>Performance had been a problem almost from the start. It is a very drawing-intensive application, and I spent time optimizing the path to Quartz. Eventually everything goes through a CGImage, but there is some overhead getting there. I knew more could be done.</p>
<p>Eventually I bothered to run Shark on it. Within 30 seconds it revealed that almost 50% of the application time was being spent inside CGContextSelectFont, which was called very frequently for the very basic text drawing that was needed. I had not even suspected that code. I rewrote it to use ATSUI and all the performance problems immediately melted away. And it wasn&rsquo;t even optimized ATSUI &#8212; just brain-dead create a text layout, font size, and draw.</p>
<p>It was not obvious to me that CGContextSelectFont would be so slow, so I&rsquo;m posting this one for Google to pick up. Happy coding!</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.damonclinkscales.com/">Damon</a> and I have been discussing how time constraints can encourage creativity. I hinted at this in <a href="../../../2005/11/10302_words.html">my first NaNoWriMo post</a>, and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been trying on other projects at work. Of course the concept is all through <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/constraints_breed_breakthrough_creativity.php">what 37signals is doing</a>.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago there was a web application I wanted to write. I estimated it would take a couple of weeks to knock in the basic functionality. A small project, but big enough that it would have to be juggled with other priorities. And the requirements would need to be discussed with other members of the team, which might mean a quick death at the hands of committee-led design.</p>
<p>Encouraged by <a href="http://del.icio.us/willie">Willie</a> over that weekend, we said let&#8217;s just do it and see what happens. Monday morning I asked myself: could I implement most of the application&#8230; <i>before lunch?</i> Because if I couldn&#8217;t, the project would still probably be sitting at zero lines of code. Luckily the app was a simple discussion system, and Rails was a particularly good fit for it.</p>
<p>In the latest The Writing Show podcast, <a href="http://www.wynia.org/wordpress/2005/12/06/the-writing-show-interviews-me-podcast/">J Wynia</a> talks about why NaNoWriMo works. He said the biggest problem writers are faced with is the blank page. NaNoWriMo forces you to start writing immediately, because otherwise you won&#8217;t have a chance of finishing 50,000 words in a month. And something magic happens when you&#8217;ve written the first sentence: before you know it stories and characters are flowing and you&#8217;ve got a half dozen pages or more. If you waited until the first page of the novel had been fully thought out in your mind, you&#8217;d still be looking at a blank page.</p>
<p><a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/creativity_on_s.html">Kathy Sierra wrote about creativity on speed</a>, but I take issue with part of her post. I see speed in development work (C++, Ruby, whatever) as a good thing when it forces you to do something you would not otherwise be able to do because the task was too daunting. But speed in art is something else entirely. The latter is the whole subject of Betty Edwards&#8217; classic book Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. The idea is that by working quickly (gesture drawing, for example), you draw on instinct and what you are seeing, and less on what you think you know about how something looks.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to this concept in animation through the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?tag=mantonorg&amp;keyword=Shamus+Culhane&amp;mode=books">books of Shamus Culhane</a>. It resonated with me immediately not just because I knew it was true &#8212; it matched my own experience with life drawing &#8212; but because he first discovered this while working on an old 1930s Mickey and Pluto short (Hawaiian Holiday) that I remember fondly as a kid (I still have the VHS copy). In some ways the high-speed drawing technique works even better in animation because you are already talking about time. The faster you work the closer the process itself resembles the final product on screen.</p>
<p>While building software is definitely an art &#8212; especially the process of crafting the user interface, or just bootstrapping an idea from nothing through brainstorming &#8212; I don&#8217;t think programming benefits from speed in the same way that art does. With software development the main benefit you get from working fast is breaking through roadblocks, simplifying, and getting things done. The creativity is a result of forcing yourself to think of things in a new way.</p>

			<p>I don&#8217;t consider myself a perfectionist. In fact, I can often be downright lazy. I write sloppy code sometimes. I am hasty with my artwork instead of thorough. I am always impatient to see the end result, regardless of what I am doing. (Oh, and my office is usually a mess.)</p>
<p>But when it comes to things that really matter, I have pretty high standards. When focused I can solve problems well and my attention to detail usually pays off. I am self-critical, which means I can improve.</p>
<p>I attended a Tufte talk earlier this year, and one thing that struck me was how dedicated he is to perfection. He phrases it in a different way, though, less assuming. &#8220;Do no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>When creating something &#8212; art, code, prose &#8212; there is an immediate personal attachment to that thing. Not only is it difficult to see mistakes in it, it seems almost impossible to throw it out and start again. But you have to. The trick is to see the investment in time not as wasted, but as a necessary first step in getting to the final place.</p>
<p>Write half the novel and then rip it apart, let go of the parts that you know aren&#8217;t working and try again. Refactor, redesign, redraw.</p>
<p>One of the revolutions at Disney in the 30s and 40s wasn&#8217;t just incredible talent, it was things like paying the extra money to film pencil tests, so that animators could see their work as it would appear on screen and fix mistakes instead of shipping it off blindly to the distributor. No one else was doing that because it didn&#8217;t seem to make business sense. That is, until you saw the improved results. (Software usability testing is a lot like that, too.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.animated-news.com/archives/00003772.html">recent interview with Animated News</a>, Andreas Deja talks about Walt and his high standards:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to inspired by Walt and what he did, and his standards. He just had these high standards, he would just give the audience something that they didn&#8217;t expect, that was beyond what they thought they would get, always aiming higher. And that&#8217;s one of his traits, that&#8217;s something to really shoot for, to go the extra mile, do even better than people would expect of you. I think it goes along with being a good artist, you&#8217;re never satisfied. It&#8217;s never good enough. That&#8217;s just the way it is. I think with that attitude you learn.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And with that, I&#8217;m off to create something instead of sleeping.</p>

			<p>One of our big projects at work just launched: the <a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/betterbooks/">VitalSource Store</a>. James Duncan Davidson and Mike Clark have posted about what it was like working on this project. My favorite posts include <a href="http://blog.x180.net/2005/07/rails_sandbox_d.html">this one about the Rails development sandbox</a>, and <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2005/07/12#ProduceConsumeXML">this one about RESTful web services</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irelan.net/becoming/past/2005/08/16/this-is-the-part-where-i-get-to-talk-about-my-job/">Ryan also chimed in</a> earlier this week about the project. It feels good to write about work in this space for me too, something I have rarely done but will likely do more as our company becomes well known.</p>
<p>Although the software is now freely available like iTunes, we&rsquo;ve all been hard at work on this stuff for a while now. In fact the current Mac and Windows clients started life over 4 years ago, and there is a bunch of shared code in there from our internal tools that is older still. We&rsquo;ve been shipping product to customers the whole time, but it feels good to now open things up to anyone.</p>
<p>If you look below the surface, there is a pretty incredible foundation that we can build good stuff on top of. Comments like <a href="http://www.anarchogeek.com/articles/2005/08/18/vitalsource-bookshelf-itunes-for-ebooks">this one from Anarchogeek</a> hit on exactly what we are trying to do:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s amazing to me is how the vital bookshelf is a slick mix of a web / desktop application. It uses html, javascript, and css, but it also uses native windows and interface elements. It&rsquo;s very nicely done.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

			<p>The .Mac SDK session here at WWDC was interesting. First, it was forward-looking, not something we&#8217;ve seen much this year with the exception of Intel. Also, it wasn&#8217;t covered under NDA (hence this blog post).</p>
<p>The 2.0 kit will be Tiger-only when it ships next month, but it will provide some really powerful features such as publish-and-subscribe and secondary user accounts that live off a paid .Mac account. Lots of fun applications surely to come. Apple wants to enable deep collaboration across applications.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it&#8217;s been a few days and many developers have already brought their apps up on Intel. The general consensus now seems to be that this will be a smooth and very fast transition. If there are new Intel-based PowerBooks ready in January, there will be a wide-variety of popular apps ready for it.</p>
<p>I use CodeWarrior for most projects, but I was still surprised to hear Apple say that almost half of Mac developers have also yet to switch to Xcode. That will be the biggest chore for most people.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the good times Metrowerks. CodeWarrior was a great development environment, and in its time PowerPlant was a great framework. The Mac OS X transition has always been a mix of steps forward and back, and Xcode will be no different.</p>

			<p>I don&#8217;t like Safari-style tabs. Sure, I use them &#8212; and in NetNewsWire if you want to use the built-in web browser, there is no choice) &#8212; but I&#8217;ve always thought that there should be better ways to manage windows, and it should be built into the operating system. As left to third-party developers, each application implements tabs in a slightly different way. Everything from the visual appearance of tabs, to where they are attached to a window (drawer, sidebar, or toolbar), to how the close box works, to the keyboard shortcuts for opening and closing tabs, to the persistence of tabs.</p>
<p>Instead, Apple should have built upon Expos&eacute; to offer system-wide window grouping state, so that in any document-based application the user is in control of how windows are tabbed. Actions like dragging to rearrange tabs could be implemented once and work consistently across all applications.</p>
<p>Of course with Tiger now shipping, it&#8217;s probably too late. By the time 10.5 is announced a year from now the damage will be all but permanent. It always impressed me that Apple was so quick to roll out a standard toolbar implementation in both Cocoa and Carbon, and I think we would have seen similar gains from a tabs framework.</p>

			<p>Leaving <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/sxsw">SXSW</a> I think I noticed two major themes at the conference this year:</p>
<p><strong>Software development.</strong> Jason Fried&rsquo;s talk on small teams set the tone here. Get close to your users, start building the real thing early, and keep it small so you can change easily. In <a href="http://nickfinck.com/presentations/sxsw2005/">&ldquo;How to Inform Design&rdquo;</a>, Jeffrey Veen took part of that one step further. Instead of user-centered design, he strives for <em>self-centered</em> design. If you become the user, you&rsquo;ll know how to build it.</p>
<p>Thinking about software development approaches &mdash; especially when they take an extreme position &mdash; is useful to me because you can take those statements and stamp them onto past successes or failures to see whether there is any connection. Many interesting work conversations followed.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata.</strong> Tags, folksonomies, and the lowercase semantic web. There were at least four sessions on this topic, from <a href="http://complexspiral.com/events/archive/2005/sxsw/">Eric Meyer&rsquo;s introduction</a> on XHTML-based microformats to the panel of RDF skeptics lead by Matt Haughey. These problems are hard to solve. When I was originally interested in an internet of rich metadata it never occurred to me that the solution might come from the grassroots, a virtual community of taggers bringing structure with nothing more than keywords and a few smart pieces of software.</p>
<p>Ultimately it&rsquo;s a UI issue. Flickr and Del.icio.us are successful because they make it easy and provide a clear incentive (the ability to find things again). Other distributed metadata initiatives are simple to use because they work within the existing web we know (XHTML and URLs), but we still need applications that will provide that same incentive for users to care. Maybe <a href="http://www.rubhub.com/">Rubhub</a> is a start.</p>

			<p>It was fun while it lasted, but PHP&rsquo;s time may have come and gone. The benefits of PHP in the early days (extremely fast prototyping, embedded in HTML) outweighed the problems (haphazard function naming, poor object-oriented features, and difficulty designing large applications).</p>
<p>PHP Everywhere discusses <a href="http://phplens.com/phpeverywhere/?q=node/view/169">the move to more robust object-oriented features</a> to compete directly with Java. But some of the old design decisions cannot be swept under the rug. They will remain, leaving an awkward architectural mess.</p>
<p>Web applications are not like traditional applications, where you make an investment in a programming language and source code that makes it all but impossible to change. Web apps are constantly evolving, being rewritten. Or they are obsoleted, shelved. A new domain name is registered and the process starts again.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a>, simple and elegant, drawing the best from the PHP and Java camps. There&rsquo;s been a lot of criticism from the Java world, but many of those people write code like it was a traditional application anyway &mdash; big, complex, connected to legacy systems. They are too invested to switch, and that&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>But the PHP people will switch, easily, and with the apparent momentum of Ruby right now, maybe it&rsquo;s already happening. Forget the enterprise for now. Rails is a perfect fit for anyone who develops for the web on its own terms, and the people behind apps like Basecamp, 43things, and the upcoming <a href="http://www.odeo.com/">Odeo</a> match that profile.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> <a href="http://hivelogic.com/archives/2005/02/27/regarding-ruby-and-ruby-on-rails/">Dan responds</a> with further exploration of PHP, Java, and Ruby, focusing on why Ruby may not be well suited as an introductory programming language.</p>

			<p><img src="../../../images/2004/delicious_gradient.jpg" border="0" height="259" width="200" alt="Delicious Library" align="right" hspace="12" /> Apparently I wasn&#8217;t the only person to purchase <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> in the first week of release. They&#8217;ve had $250,000 in sales so far. For an app that no one really <i>needs</i>, this is pretty incredible.</p>
<p>And no office space overhead. At O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s Mac conference Wil Shipley emphasized a similar point, to cut costs down by selling directly to the customer instead of a boxed product in stores. See <a href="http://www.niallkennedy.com/blog/archives/2004/10/how_to_run_your.html">Niall Kennedy&#8217;s blog post</a> for a link to the MP3.</p>
<p>Wil also likes Cocoa Bindings. From an <a href="http://developer.apple.com/business/macmarket/deliciouslibrary.html">Apple interview about Cocoa Bindings</a>, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It makes it really easy for programmers to present data in a way that&rsquo;s very clear and intuitive to the user. It makes every app look and feel like an iApp.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t bought into Bindings yet. I <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2004/11/19/cocoa-bindings/">commented on Michael Tsai&#8217;s blog</a> about it last month. The funny thing is, the little details in Delicious Library that are so impressive required some significant programming, and shaving a few dozen lines of code that handles sorting in a table view seems to pale in comparison. For example, look at the gradient in this screenshot, and how it works correctly for contiguous or non-contiguous rows. You don&#8217;t get that kind of stuff for free.</p>

			<p>I didn&#8217;t know exactly what to expect when I signed up for Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/events/techtalks/">Tiger Tech Talk</a>. It looked like a sort of mini WWDC event, and since the first stop on their tour was here in Austin, it was a no-brainer to sign up. But would it be just a marketing-filled event with little real substance? Or maybe just rehashing of WWDC slides but given by less prominent developers?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to report that it was a high-quality event. Apple was represented by such familiar faces as Xavier Legros, John Geleynse, Travis Brown, and George Warner. Extra perks included free continental breakfast (I should have shown up earlier), lunch, dinner appetizers, and drinks. The Tiger compatibility lab had about 10 G5s.</p>
<p>Most of the sessions were essentially repeats from WWDC, but the informal nature of  the setting allowed for good questions. Apple said about 120 people registered, and there were four concurrent sessions after the overview talks.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.flowdelic.org/">Mason Hale</a> of frog design started a weblog last week, and already he&#8217;s got some great posts and discussion. Mason and I worked together around 1995. You know, back when the Internet was still fun.</p>
<p>At the time, Mason had been building a CGI framework inside Frontier. This coincided with Frontier&#8217;s time as a free application and helped jump start Dave Winer&#8217;s push to build Internet-related applications around Frontier. I built a number of web applications in Frontier, wrote some <a href="../../../archive/idiom/mactivity_presentation/index.html">cool un-shipped software</a> that used an embedded Frontier database, and even helped host and maintain the Frontier-Talk mailing list for a time. After a few years, Frontier and I went our separate ways. (Bonus in the previous link: The web server plug-in mentioned in the slides from 1996 was called Rendezvous.)</p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/05/17#asGoodATimeAsAny">Dave Winer announced</a> that the Frontier kernel&#8217;s source code will be released for the first time. This is a really interesting move and, like all good ideas, probably could have had more of an impact if done earlier. AppleScript dominates desktop automation now, but a focused set of Frontier tools could still be very useful. I don&#8217;t think this effort will fizzle like the <a href="http://macbird.userland.com/">MacBird release</a> did, in part because Frontier is already Carbonized (see <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2842">Brent&#8217;s comments about that</a>) and in use by developers.</p>
<p>Mason and I still bump into each other every once in a while, but now it&#8217;s more as parents than as geeks. To Dave, Mason, Brent, <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Wes</a>, and everyone else that contributed to Frontier&#8217;s history: congrats.</p>

The new control drag-and-drop Carbon Events are only partially documented. In addition to returning noErr from your kEventControlDragEnter Carbon Event, you need to set the kEventParamControlLikesDrag parameter to true if you want to receive the drag. Unfortunately this constant is missing from the headers. The correct value is: &#8216;cldg&#8217;.</p>
<p>Your code should look something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>Boolean t = true;</p>
<p>SetEventParameter (inEvent, 'cldg' /*kEventParamControlLikesDrag*/, typeBoolean, sizeof(Boolean), &#038;t);</code></p></blockquote>

				<a href="../../../2003/12/why_cocoa_text.html" rel="bookmark">Why Cocoa text drags are broken</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Apple still hasn&#8217;t fixed text drag-and-drop in Cocoa. In addition to going against how drag-and-drop has worked in previous versions of Mac OS for a decade, I believe it is based on a flawed concept. Has it seen any usability testing within Apple?</p>
<p>I guess the argument for this behavior goes something like this: Because selecting text is more common than drag-and-drop, dragging over a previously selected run of text should take precedence. If you really want to drag the text itself, merely hold the mouse down for a half-second after the click and then drag. Simple, right?</p>
<p>Not at all, for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is counter to how drag and drop works in the rest of the system.</li>
<li>It is slower.</li>
<li>It is difficult for a new user to &#8220;learn&#8221; this Cocoa behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first is easy enough. If you can drag most &#8220;things&#8221; (a file in the Finder, or a window, or an object in a graphic design application) by clicking and dragging right away, why should dragging selected text be any different?</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s slower not just because you have to click and hold, but because you have to think too much. How long do I hold? Half second? Full second? Us humans never know exactly, and it&#8217;s easy to make a mistake and get a selection when you wanted a drag.</p>
<p>To illustrate what I mean by the last reason, let&#8217;s go over how someone would learn to make selections and use text drag-and-drop.</p>
<p>The Cocoa way: User makes a selection. They want to drag that selection, but instead the app keeps making a new selection where they clicked. User tries a few more times, then gives up, thinking that the app doesn&#8217;t support dragging of text. They use copy-and-paste instead.</p>
<p>The Carbon and old Mac way: User makes a selection. They drag that selection and it works as expected. If they are a new user, they might try to make a selection inside an existing selection, but without meaning to drag it. In this case they get the wrong behavior &#8212; the text starts to drag and they are momentarily confused. The next time this happens, they realize that they should single-click to remove the selection before making a new one in the same run of text.</p>
<p>See the difference? With the original Mac drag-and-drop behavior, the user might make a mistake once but that process teaches them how selection and drag-and-drop works. With the Cocoa behavior, the user might <b>never</b> learn how text drag-and-drop works!</p>
<p>Luckily, Mac developers using Cocoa can override this behavior in their application (which speaks to the power of those frameworks), but I have yet to see an application that does.</p>

			<p>While looking for something else the other day, I ran across <a href="http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1028.html">this Apple technote</a>. I think it illustrates quite nicely the kind of sacrifices that were made to put Mac OS on top of unix. In the end the rewards are worth it, but the way volumes are handled is a step backwards. Seems like they could have created a small root partition, just for links to standard unix directories (usr, lib, etc), and mounted volumes in their own directories /My hard drive, /My apps, etc. This &#8220;/Volumes&#8221; business is silly. It&#8217;s another example of the fragility of the new system.</p>
<p>We used to brag that you could rename your System Folder and the Mac would still boot. Those days are long gone.</p>

			<p>Paul Graham&#8217;s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html">Hackers and Painters essay</a> surprised me. I put off reading it for months, because I assumed I knew what it was about &#8212; that programmers are artists, that their work today is just as important an art form as that of painters during the Renaissance. And sure, there&#8217;s some of that in there, but that&#8217;s not really the point at all. By looking for patterns between two seemingly unrelated subjects, Paul attempts to better understand the strengths or weaknesses of different approaches to programming. In the process I think he also defines what a hacker is &#8212; a tinkerer, a designer, but also someone who jumps in and starts coding. Not all programming projects should be tackled this way, and that&#8217;s fine too.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If universities and research labs keep hackers from doing the kind of work they want to do, perhaps the place for them is in companies. Unfortunately, most companies won&#8217;t let hackers do what they want either. Universities and research labs force hackers to be scientists, and companies force them to be engineers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only discovered this myself quite recently. When Yahoo bought Viaweb, they asked me what I wanted to do. I had never liked the business side very much, and said that I just wanted to hack. When I got to Yahoo, I found that what hacking meant to them was implementing software, not designing it. Programmers were seen as technicians who translated the visions (if that is the word) of product managers into code.&#8221;</p>

			<p>TidBITS, <a href="http://db.tidbits.com/getbits.acgi?tbart=07356">iMovie 3 Tips and Gotchas</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Although the program introduced a number of welcome new features, performance was sluggish, the program crashed for no reason, and exporting data was problematic. iMovie 3 had become the new Word 6 (for those who remember that giant step backwards).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I still wonder about performance sometimes. Why is iCal so slow anyway? And why is the rewritten-in-Cocoa iMovie 3 slower than iMovie 1 and 2? No doubt that it is design decisions more than the language or framework that makes an app slow. OmniOutliner and Keynote are two examples of fast Cocoa apps.</p>
<p>I spent several weeks last month working on Cocoa experiments &#8212; small test applications and new features in a Carbon application. It&#8217;s clear that the Cocoa framework is very powerful. If I started a new application from scratch I would probably use Cocoa, but for an existing Carbon application the choice is more difficult.</p>
<p>Look at apps like iTunes. It&#8217;s still all Carbon, even the new music store. Or Final Cut Pro. These are some of Apple&#8217;s best apps. Not to mention Photoshop and Illustrator. Why should I abandon Carbon if it produces apps like these?</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s something else: I trust the Carbon team at Apple. They know the Mac better than most &#8212; not just the APIs but what it takes to build solid apps, and what the essence of Mac UI is all about.</p>
<p>I need to think about this more. Contrary to <a href="../../../2003/08/05.html">my previous post</a>, mixing Cocoa and Carbon windows in the same application is problematic. Window focus doesn&#8217;t always work correctly, and dealing with menu commands in two different ways complicates the app. A better approach would be to stick with one framework for the UI (Cocoa or HIToolbox), and mix-and-match Cocoa and Carbon as needed under the hood.</p>
