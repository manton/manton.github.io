				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feels like years in the making, but I&#8217;ve finally moved all my domain names to a single provider: DNSimple. The last 3 domains went through toward the end of 2015. They were .io domains, and required calling Network Solutions to unlock. (I own 13 domains, and don&#8217;t plan to add any more for a very long time.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found that the simplicity of having these kind of things consolidated in one place really improves keeping up with hosting and renewals. It&#8217;s the same reason I moved all my private projects to GitHub, even though it would cost more per month. It means less to worry about, so more time for coding.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve often been thinking about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">the lack of permanence on the web</a>, I also want to be more proactive about extending my domain registrations. I renewed manton.org until 2021.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in using DNSimple, use <a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/9fc1dd2e59824b">this referral link</a> for a month free. All my SSL certificates are there too, although I&#8217;m keeping an eye on <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, Twitter experimented with changing the timeline, so it&#8217;s not strictly reverse-chronological. Then, they renamed Favorites to Likes.

  &#8220;The current plan is reportedly to show just the first 140 characters in the news feed and then allow readers to click to expand the tweet and see the other 9,860 remaining characters. The new option may launch later this quarter.&#8221;

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/hyperlinks-and-saving-the-web">the health of the open web</a>, Maciej Cegłowski gave a talk on web page bloat at the Web Directions conference, and he put <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">the slides and notes online</a> (via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/01/02/website-obesity-crisis">Daring Fireball</a>). It&#8217;s fun to read and there are many great points, but I want to focus on Accelerated Mobile Pages:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The AMP project is ostentatiously open source, and all kinds of publishers have signed on. Out of an abundance of love for the mobile web, Google has volunteered to run the infrastructure, especially the user tracking parts of it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarcasm aside, I think Google&#8217;s involvement is mostly transparent, and I was hopeful about it when <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/accelerated-mobile-pages-from-google.html">I wrote about this in November</a>. Google wants the web to be fast. A faster web includes more ad impressions and is more competitive with native mobile apps. I don&#8217;t think this disqualifies Google from proposing this project.</p>
<p><a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/12/14/does-amp-counter-an-existential-threat-to-google.html">High Scalability has a long article</a> exploring AMP:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Google needs an open and rich ecosystem of knowledge. If that’s not there then Google search won’t be relevant. Which is Google’s direct self-interest, which is also the same objective of the publisher. Publishers need access to an open ecosystem of distribution. Otherwise they’ll have a harder time building audiences if they have to appeal to closed platforms. Yes, Google is a private company that has business interests, but that philosophy and that core similar objective is something very important when considering Google’s role in AMP.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to give Google the benefit of the doubt on AMP. The alternatives are too focused on specific platforms and so even less available to the rest of the web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/12/apple-watch-follow-up">Stephen Hackett posted</a> an Apple Watch follow-up recently. He has mostly stopped wearing it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The Apple Watch can do a lot of neat things, and I miss its fitness tracking, but so much of it just doesn&#8217;t fit my lifestyle anymore. It&#8217;s not super useful for work, apps are still miserably slow and at times, its an additional distraction.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Apple Watch is a very personal device. It&#8217;s okay that it&#8217;s not for everyone. There&#8217;s no network effect; the watch isn&#8217;t better or worse if other people don&#8217;t use it. And it&#8217;s even okay if most of the apps are too slow to bother with. Fitness tracking, notifications, the time — for me, those 3 simple features are enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2015/12/17/apple-watch-revisited">Casey Liss also writes</a> that notifications have been one of the most important features, letting him keep his iPhone ringer off:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The Apple Watch has allowed my iPhone to transition from being a <em>personal</em> device to being a <em>private</em> one. That’s a really profound change. More so than I expected.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Once every couple of months, I leave the house in a hurry and forget to put my Apple Watch on. I survive without it, of course, but I do miss it. After not wearing a watch for most of my life, it&#8217;s weird now if I don&#8217;t have the Apple Watch with me. I expect to use it for years to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/12/17Apple-Names-Jeff-Williams-Chief-Operating-Officer.html">Apple announced</a> some leadership changes today, including that Phil Schiller will now lead the App Store on Apple&#8217;s various platforms:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;With added responsibility for the App Store, Phil Schiller will focus on strategies to extend the ecosystem Apple customers have come to love when using their iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Phil now leads nearly all developer-related functions at Apple, in addition to his other marketing responsibilities including Worldwide Product Marketing, international marketing, education and business marketing.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>You may remember that Phil Schiller has gotten involved in controversial App Store rejections in the past, going back to 2009. See <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2009/08/phil_schiller_app_store">this post from Daring Fireball</a> about Ninjawords, and another article <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/15/phil-schiller-is-a-man-on-a-mission-to-save-the-app-store/">at Techcrunch by MG Siegler</a>.</p>
<p>On recent episodes of <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, and in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/12/too-late-to-save-the-mas.html">a blog post</a>, I&#8217;ve argued that Apple can&#8217;t just make small improvements to the Mac App Store anymore. The time for slow iteration is over; now they have to make big changes to get developers back. I&#8217;d like to believe that putting Phil in charge is exactly that kind of first big step.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Less optimistically, though, there was <a href="http://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2012/06/08/in-response-to-mr-schiller/">this post in 2012 from Rogue Amoeba</a>.</p>

  &#8220;What the past few days have taught me is that if I needed to switch from Mac to iPad, if I had a compelling reason, I could absolutely do it.

<p>I don&#8217;t think Jason got an Apple Pencil or Smart Keyboard, although maybe he&#8217;ll have one of each in time for his full review. If you&#8217;ve enjoyed reading Six Colors as much as I have over the last year, <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">consider subscribing too</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/stars-vs-hearts-and-twitters-decline.html">replying to podcast topics with blog posts</a>, I have some comments after listening to a recent <a href="http://www.relay.fm/clockwise/111">Clockwise</a>. It was another great episode, featuring hosts Jason Snell and Dan Moren, and guests Christina Warren and Susie Ochs.</p>
<p>The panel was split on the likelihood of a new 4-inch iPhone from Apple. Apple is a company of patterns, so it seems counterintuitive that they&#8217;d release a new phone in the Winter or Spring instead of the Fall. But doing so has a couple of nice advantages: first, you can bump up an otherwise slow sales quarter with a new product; and second, you don&#8217;t hurt sales of the primary iPhones (the 6S and 6S Plus) by confusing buyers with another choice. Customers perfectly happy with their iPhone 6 from last year, and who were planning on buying a 6S as a natural upgrade, now would be faced with an unexpected choice in screen size if the 4-inch phone had been announced alongside the 6S.</p>
<p>Everyone also seems to forget about <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/">the newest 4-inch iPod Touch</a>. It went on sale in July, features an A8 processor, better camera than the iPhone 5S, and sells for only $199. It&#8217;s easy to imagine Apple basing a new 4-inch iPhone on this design, reusing both the screen and many of the internal components from the iPod Touch.</p>
<p>Apple has sold a lot of iPhone 6 and 6S phones. But there are also a lot of 4-inch devices out in the world: of course the iPhone 5, 5C, and 5S, but also every iPod Touch sold in the last few years. There are many people who would love to replace their old phone with a new one that&#8217;s better and faster, but not bigger.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/how-it-works/">The project technical overview for AMP</a> has the goals and basic info. In a nutshell, the new format encourages a return to more bare-bones HTML, with some added functionality for common web patterns. On the balance between bloated ad platforms and user experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Embedding an ad or analytics often implies giving up control of what eventually happens to a site because they can typically inject any JavaScript they want into pages. AMP HTML does not allow this. We realize that both ads and analytics are an important element of monetization on the web, and so we need to support them: our goal is to realign monetization with great user experience.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, &#8220;tracking pixels&#8221; are used for analytics. These should be easily skipped by ad blockers, but apps that support AMP will need to use a custom web view anyway, where ad blockers on iOS aren&#8217;t allowed. This may continue to limit the appeal of Safari View Controller.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/googles-got-plan-make-mobile-web-less-slow/">Wired covers the announcement</a> and describes how AMP might be integrated into Twitter and other native apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;One surprise beneficiary of AMP may be Twitter. While it’s not a publisher per se, it’s becoming an increasingly important player in news, most recently with the launch of <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/meet-moments-twitters-new-feature/">its Moments feature</a>, which makes news easier to follow on Twitter by organizing Tweets in a chronological, coherent timeline. Now, Twitter will automatically load any articles that are compatible with AMP as AMP files, meaning they will benefit from the same speed inside the Twitter app.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml">more on GitHub</a>. On the surface this seems like a more open approach than Facebook Instant Articles or maybe even Apple News Format (which is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/Apple_News_Format_Ref/index.html">finally public</a>). That <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/mobile-web/">WordPress is supporting AMP</a> is a good sign.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve had fun since Friday exploring the App Store on the Apple TV. There are a lot of expected apps but also some nice surprises. The only app that&#8217;s really missing for us is <a href="https://www.sling.com/">Sling TV</a>. As soon as that ships, we&#8217;ll no longer need the Roku.</p>
<p>I love apps that use full-screen photos to take advantage of the big screen — obviously games and streaming video, but even apps like Airbnb. <a href="http://conradstoll.com/blog/2015/10/30/introducing-picturesque-national-parks-image-trivia-game-for-apple-tv">Conrad Stoll also released a new game</a> called Picturesque, where you try to identify photos of national parks in a time limit that varies by difficulty:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;It&#8217;s always exciting when you can build a product that bridges different hobbies and interest. Picturesque combines my work as an iOS developer with my passions for <a href="http://conradstoll.com/blog/2014/1/5/forward-climbing-mountains">Backpacking</a> and <a href="http://cnstoll.500px.com/john_muir">Photography</a>. I&#8217;m happy for the result to be both my first game and my first foray into this new platform.&#8221;

<p>It&#8217;s also great to see <a href="http://www.spaceageapp.com/">Space Age</a> make the jump to the Apple TV. We&#8217;ve been playing a few games that are free downloads because we had already purchased them on iOS, including Oceanhorn and Crossy Road.</p>
