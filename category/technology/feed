				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few of years ago we took a vacation to New York City and Montreal. We were taking the subway so often, I switched to Google Maps for its transit directions. I&#8217;ve been using Google Maps exclusively ever since.</p>
<p>Until now, there were very few reasons to go back to Apple Maps. Apple has been playing catch-up. <a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/complex-decisions.html">Why use a product</a> that is only adding features from a competitor, but not anything new?</p>
<p>This week Apple rolled out a unique feature that&#8217;s interesting to me: ChargePoint integration to find charging locations for electric cars. Ryan Christoffel covers it <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/apple-maps-adds-chargepoint-integration/">at MacStories</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Having spent several years building partnerships to ensure its data won&#8217;t lead any drivers astray, Apple has more recently been able to focus on integrating data that&#8217;s less important, but still quite useful. A few months ago we saw the company <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/parkopedia-and-apple-strike-maps-deal/">team up with Parkopedia</a> to improve parking data, and now charging stations are a natural next step.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I rarely need this — and the ChargePoint app itself has more detail, such as how many spots are actually available — but I&#8217;m excited about it as a new feature. I hope that it represents a fundamental improvement across the maps platform. I&#8217;m putting Apple Maps back on my home screen for a while.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was 2008 in Chicago, the C4 conference was wrapping up and I shared a cab to the airport with Alex Payne, who built the first Twitter API. I was so excited about the potential for the platform that I probably had a dozen ideas for Twitter apps. Alex and I sat at a cafe at the airport, waiting for our respective flights, and talked about the future.</p>
<p>Years passed. I did build and ship a few Twitter apps, including the popular Tweet Marker sync API. But I also grew disillusioned. I took a break from using Twitter.</p>
<p>Alex had left the company and Twitter was much different from a business and leadership perspective by the time the rest of the world started paying attention. Thousands of employees worked at Twitter. How many of them had experienced the early days of following friends&#8217; tweets via SMS, when the service seemed genuinely new and important? The future had arrived but it was full of hashtags.</p>
<p>This year — with rumors of Twitter being acquired, with fake news and the election, with online harassment — many people have written about the future of Twitter. I&#8217;ve been paying attention again, experimenting <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/fine-heres-a-twitter-feed.html">with cross-posting</a>. I missed the 10th anniversary of when I joined Twitter in July 2006, but not the date of <a href="https://twitter.com/manton/status/1457463">my first tweet</a> a few months later.</p>
<p>10 years is a good milestone to reflect on. I want to highlight a few posts I&#8217;ve read recently, and then wrap things up at the end.</p>
<p>What I like about <a href="https://productmatters.design/the-ghosts-of-twitter-past-present-and-future-a02827120927">this article by Faruk Ateş</a> is that he gives a sense of the major changes Twitter has gone through, most of which were difficult to fully understand at the time. On the change with @-replies:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The second thing is that when they started hiding @-replies to people you don’t follow, they stripped the user experience of a vital ingredient for civility: peer transparency. The tone of discourse changed much for the worse over time, following that new behavior of the timeline. Before the rollout, all your friends would see if you behaved like a jerk to someone; after the rollout that was no longer the case. It removed the natural consequences of bad behavior, thereby encouraging people to reap the benefits of such bad behavior much more frequently.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a theme across many posts, that we didn&#8217;t realize what all these changes were adding up to. I have some related thoughts <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/11/fake-news-and-instagram.html">about Instagram</a> and another post on why <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/11/todays-social-networks-are-broken.html">today&#8217;s social networks are broken</a>.</p>
<p>Next, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-twitter-dorsey-strategy/">Sarah Frier writes for Bloomberg</a> about how Twitter leadership is losing faith in Jack Dorsey. That despite new features such as live video, Twitter failed to ship other development efforts and fell behind competitors:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Advertisers see potential in the company’s live video strategy, but they’re also being wooed by photo- and video-sharing app Snapchat, and Facebook’s Instagram, which has recently become more advertiser-friendly. At the time of Twitter’s 2013 initial public offering, those services weren’t close competitors. Now they both have larger daily audiences than Twitter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As long as Jack Dorsey has 2 jobs, it will be easy to blame him for being unfocused. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s fair. But when streaming live football gets so much attention, there do appear to be competing visions at Twitter.</p>
<p>Twitter is too expensive to acquire. It&#8217;s also too flawed for a company like Disney to take a risk on. So instead there was <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/10/27/13399872/twitter-layoffs-q3-earnings">another round of layoffs</a>. From Kurt Wagner at Recode:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Last year, <a href="http://www.recode.net/2015/10/13/11619520/twitter-will-cut-more-than-300-employees-8-percent-of-staff">Twitter also cut 300 jobs</a> shortly after Jack Dorsey took on the CEO role full-time. (Or part-time, given that he’s also running Square.) The current feeling among those close to the company is that Twitter is simply too bloated, and pays too much in stock-based compensation for a company that’s still not profitable.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are no guarantees for an unprofitable company. The only certain thing is that something will change.</p>
<p>Back to Alex Payne. <a href="https://al3x.net/2010/09/15/last-thing-about-twitter.html">He wrote a post 6 years ago</a> about his time at Twitter, and his unsuccessful attempt to convince coworkers to decentralize Twitter. It holds up very well:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Decentralization isn’t just a better architecture, it’s an architecture that resists censorship and the corrupting influences of capital and marketing. At the very least, decentralization would make tweeting as fundamental and irrevocable a part of the Internet as email.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It used to be impossible to imagine that Twitter could fail. And today, it&#8217;s still unlikely to vanish or even change much overnight. But the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">web will be better</a> if we <em>assume</em> that Twitter is a lost cause. From the 10-year view, it&#8217;s clear that Twitter has already changed.</p>
<p>Acquisition rumors come and go, although they seem more real this time, and we&#8217;re reminded that few web sites last forever. <a href="http://micro.blog/">It&#8217;s time to prepare</a> for a web without Twitter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shutting down a web site correctly isn&#8217;t easy. When <a href="https://medium.com/talkshow/we-are-shutting-down-talkshow-on-december-1-98ea1dacf3c8">Talkshow announced</a> they were closing, I was surprised. Six months is a limited time to launch, get traction, and then wind down. But I was glad that they&#8217;d let any show be exported as an archive.</p>
<p>The archives aren&#8217;t available for very long. If you hosted a show on Talkshow, you have until December 1st to download it.</p>
<p>I downloaded a couple to see how Talkshow handled it. Just in case no one else grabs them, I&#8217;m copying them here: <a href="http://www.manton.org/archive/talkshow.im/poplife/">Pop Life episode 5</a> with Anil Dash and guest John Gruber, and the <a href="http://www.manton.org/archive/talkshow.im/sixcolors/">Six Colors live coverage</a> for Apple&#8217;s September 7th event. I had Instapaper-ed both of these to read later anyway.</p>
<p>The archive itself is a simple .zip file with HTML, CSS, and user profile images. In the Finder it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2016/talkshow_im.png" width="600" height="475" alt="Talkshow.im Finder screenshot" /></p>
<p>This self-contained structure makes it very easy to re-share somewhere else. Credit to Talkshow for keeping this simple. But it also strikes me as so easy to keep hosting as static files, I wonder why Talkshow doesn&#8217;t keep the archives available indefinitely, which would preserve any existing links to these shows from the web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/accelerated-mobile-pages-from-google.html">When I first wrote about Accelerated Mobile Pages</a>, there wasn&#8217;t a true implementation. Now we see how Google is rolling this out, and it has problems. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/10/21/google-amp">John Gruber</a> uses Ars Technica as an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  On desktop browsers, these URLs do get redirected to Ars’s website. But on mobile they don’t. Share from one mobile device to another and nobody ever leaves google.com. Why would any website turn their entire mobile audience — a majority share of their total audience, for many sites today — over to Google?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is inherent in how AMP works, and we should have predicted it. If Google&#8217;s AMP implementation must run in browsers, will there always be a layer of JavaScript and custom URLs that hide the original web site?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d prefer if Google added AMP support directly to Chrome. While it would be a much more limited rollout, it would feel more natural, with fewer drawbacks for publishers.</p>
<p>Competing news platform Apple News isn&#8217;t problem-free either. The <code>apple.news://</code> shared links also add a redirect, with inconsistent behavior since not all platforms and countries even support Apple News. Apple News is an RSS reader that&#8217;s designed like a closed platform.</p>
<p>I want the web to be faster. Breaking links should not be part of the solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://waxy.org/2016/11/redesigning-waxy-2016-edition/">Andy Baio redesigned his blog recently</a> and argued that blogs still matter because of ownership and control. Of course, I agree. And though it may seem far off, there&#8217;s no guarantee that Twitter will outlast our own blogs. Andy writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Twitter, itself, may be acquired and changed in some terrible way. It’s not hard to imagine a post-Verizon Yahoo selling off Tumblr. Medium keeps pivoting, trying to find a successful revenue model. There’s no guarantee any of these platforms will be around in their current state in a year, let alone ten years from now.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ben Brooks <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/11/a-new-waxyorg/">followed up</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Having my own site gives me complete control to do whatever I want, whenever I want, however I want. I don’t understand why people ever want it any other way.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Words are powerful. Especially right now, why let anyone else have control over the format of our words and how they spread? Having a blog is a statement: our writing exists apart from the whim of an algorithmic news feed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2016/11/09/on_leaving_twitter">Brent Simmons has left Twitter</a>, frustrated with the diminishing value of the service, Twitter&#8217;s inability to deal with harassment, and more:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  And then it was part of the system that helped elect a fascist President. This tipped it over for me: it’s no longer worth my participation. The shitheads can have it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Facebook has also been in the news for <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/11/09/facebook-kill-news-feed-trump/">its role in letting fake news spread</a>. Ben Thompson has <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/fake-news/">a long essay this week on it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I get why top-down solutions are tempting: fake news and filter bubbles are in front of our face, and wouldn’t it be better if Facebook fixed them? The problem is the assumption that whoever wields that top-down power will just so happen to have the same views I do. What, though, if they don’t?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe. Though while we should debate how to balance Facebook&#8217;s enormous power, there should be a parallel effort to move away from the centralized publishing model that gave Facebook that power.</p>
<p>Facebook has confused itself into thinking it is the whole internet, and so the principles of a free press that apply to the open web, also must apply to Facebook. No. While Facebook has a great responsibility to do the right thing, because they are so big, Facebook is just a web site.</p>
<p>I want Facebook to improve. I want Twitter to improve. But I can do very little to effect change at those companies, and some problems are so fundamental as to be essentially unfixable. The web wasn&#8217;t supposed to be like this, with all the power and all the writing concentrated into so few sites.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for a new social network that brings discoverability and community without the baggage of an ad-driven network that must grow to a billion users. A social network that embraces the open web, and freedom of expression, while preserving a clean timeline that can&#8217;t be interrupted by harassment.</p>
<p>Not just one new social network. I hope that many developers will work on products that encourage independent publishing again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to take time to build. That&#8217;s why I started working on <a href="http://snippets.today/">Snippets.today</a> 2 years ago. I&#8217;ve made great progress, but I&#8217;ve also drifted, unfocused, uncommitted to finishing it, as if I knew something was missing.</p>
<p>Something <em>was</em> missing. The election results have made that clear. I was thinking big, but not big enough. The way forward must include both a decentralized publishing platform and the tools to encourage a safe community.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to know when the beta is finally ready, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">subscribe to the announce list</a>. Thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have no problems with USB-C on the new MacBook Pro. It will be a small headache at the beginning, for sure. But because it&#8217;s a standard there&#8217;s no long-term compatibility risk the way there is with removing the 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p>More on that below. First, Marco Arment <a href="https://marco.org/2016/11/02/design-for-the-present">doesn&#8217;t think using USB-C exclusively is very practical</a> in a pro laptop:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  A pro laptop released today should definitely have USB-C ports — <em>mostly</em> USB-C ports, even — but it should also have at least one USB-A port.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/11/02/design-for-the-future">John Gruber responds</a> that Apple&#8217;s strategy is to speed up adoption:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  They design for the future, and in doing so, they bring the future here faster. In the alternate universe where the new MacBook Pros ship with one USB-A port, the transition to ubiquitous USB-C peripherals and cables will happen at least a little slower.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with that. But then he closes with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m not saying Marco is wrong. I’m just saying Apple’s not wrong either. It’s the same trade-off with the iPhone 7 headphone jack.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the same at all. It&#8217;s a convenient narrative to group together both the migration away from USB-A and the one away from 3.5mm headphones. There are important differences, though.</p>
<p>USB-C is a standard that is already used in many devices from different vendors. It will become universal. The immediate replacement for the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7 is the Lightning EarPods which come in the box. Lightning is a proprietary cable that will never be used in non-Apple phones, and in fact is not even used on Macs.</p>
<p>You can argue that more and more people will use Bluetooth headphones, but I doubt they will be as common as wired headphones for many years, and there&#8217;s no guarantee that an all-wireless future will <em>ever</em> arrive. There is a very clear migration from USB-A to USB-C. The move to Lightning headphones and Bluetooth is much more complicated and not directly comparable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Federico Viticci published a great <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/iphone-7-computer-from-the-future/">review of the iPhone 7 for MacStories</a> last week. He opened with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  After nearly two years spent using a 5.5-inch iPhone, I&#8217;m accustomed to not having a compact phone anymore. The iPhone <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/iphone-6-plus-review/">6 Plus</a> and 6s Plus <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/how-the-6s-plus-is-reshaping-my-iphone-experience/">have reshaped my iPhone experience</a> for a simple reason: they give me more of the most important device in my life.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Followed by the main theme of his review:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In many ways, the iPhone 7 feels like a portable computer from the future – only in a tangible, practical way that is here with us today.

<p>I&#8217;ll admit to some jealousy of Federico&#8217;s iOS-only lifestyle. Apple&#8217;s mobile OS is fun to use in part because of its simplicity and in part because of its inherent mobility.</p>
<p>If I could only choose one computing device — one phone, no tablets, no Macs — I would get an iPhone 7 Plus. The largest phone would make for a great mini tablet, nice for photography, writing, and the web. Maybe when I retire from living in Xcode and Objective-C, I&#8217;ll daydream about traveling the country with a backpack and iPhone 7 Plus, never tied to my desk again.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, I&#8217;m fortunate that I can have a Mac and a few iOS devices. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/10/real-work-on-the-ipad.html">When I go to a conference</a>, I take the iPad Mini and big iPad Pro along with my phone. Because I have those larger devices available, I always want the convenience of carrying the smallest phone when I&#8217;m not sitting down to work. The weight and feel of the iPhone SE is perfect.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a point in Federico Viticci&#8217;s review where he covers the headphone jack controversy. He hints at a common justification I&#8217;ve heard for some of Apple&#8217;s decisions, and I think it&#8217;s kind of a defeatist attitude that is worth commenting on:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  You and I might wax philosophical about the beauty of RSS, HTML, MP4, and USB, but millions of people only demand easy tech and engaging social apps.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Federico is right, but this fact is <em>exactly why</em> those of us who are passionate about open standards must make a strong case for them. We can&#8217;t leave such important decisions only in the hands of big corporations and fickle customers. It&#8217;s our responsibility to write about what we believe is best for the web and best for the tech industry.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High-profile app rejections aren&#8217;t as common as they once were, so it&#8217;s even more shocking when an entire developer account is banned from the App Store. <a href="https://blog.kapeli.com/apple-removed-dash-from-the-app-store">Dash from Kapeli ran into this</a> after trying to migrate an account:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Today I called them and they confirmed my account migration went through and that everything is okay as far as they can tell. A few hours ago I received a “Notice of Termination” email, saying that my account was terminated due to fraudulent conduct.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2016/10/06/apples_judicial_system">Brent Simmons writes</a> about the lack of transparency and minimal appeal process:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  While this is legal, and within Apple’s rights, it’s not what we’ve come to expect from a moral judicial system. No matter what the context, we expect that the accused see the evidence against them, we expect avenues for appeal to be made available, and we expect proportional penalties.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope this misunderstanding with Dash will be cleared up soon. But issues like this will never completely go away until Apple separates app distribution from curation. As long as there is a centralized, tightly-controlled system for installing iOS apps, mistakes will happen.</p>
<p>Imagine instead if the App Store worked more like the web. Google dominates search, but they can&#8217;t shut down your web site. If you try to game the system, Google can remove you from search and limit your exposure. Likewise, developers should be able to distribute iOS apps with minimal involvement from Apple, yet apps that haven&#8217;t passed formal review won&#8217;t be searchable without a direct link, won&#8217;t ever be featured, and won&#8217;t show up in the top 100 lists.</p>
<p>A more open system for app distribution would cleanly solve several problems with the App Store. Apple would be more free to remove clutter from search results without necessarily purging apps from the store. And there would be a natural temporary consequence for suspected fraudulent behavior: simply demote the app, delisting it from search and featured collections.</p>
<p>Apple should focus on highlighting the best apps within a system that lets the app review team make occasional mistakes. There shouldn&#8217;t be such an easy toggle that wipes out an indie developer&#8217;s business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I only took iOS devices with me to Indianapolis last week for <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/conference/">Release Notes</a>. My iPad Pro with smart keyboard, for writing and podcasting; an older iPad Mini, for reading on the plane; and of course my iPhone SE.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="https://www.dancounsell.com/the-problem-with-ipad-and-why-its-not-a-mac-replacement/">Dan Counsell wrote</a> about the iPad as a poor choice for everyday work:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I know a lot of journalists use the iPad full time, and that&#8217;s fine. The reason they can use it full time is that typing text has very low system requirements. However as soon as you need to move files from one app to another or unzip a document the iPad starts to make your life more complicated.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of the issue is that out of the box, the iPad can&#8217;t do everything that a Mac can do. The iPad needs apps. As <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/09/files-on-ios/">Ben Brooks wrote</a> about Dan&#8217;s ZIP file example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It would be great if iOS expanded zip extraction as a built in tool, but it doesn’t, and yet a tool to do unzip is easily found, safe, and free.
</p></blockquote>
<p>iOS doesn&#8217;t have the Mac&#8217;s Finder. I could actually see a third-party iOS app centered on file management <em>first</em>, instead of just as an extra feature on top of text documents or photos — an app that blended a little of document providers, iCloud Drive, and app launching. Kind of in the spirit of the Finder-replacement <a href="http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/">PathFinder</a>.</p>
<p>There are iOS apps to do pretty much anything. What often makes iOS slower to use is there&#8217;s less glue between apps and documents than on the Mac. No drag and drop between apps on iOS. Fewer keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>I love how Workflow sidestepped these issues with automation. I use a workflow for <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/blogging-your-photos.html">posting Instagram photos to my own blog</a>. And Federico Viticci uses Workflow extensively. In a recent Club MacStories newsletter he shared <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/776783993522061313">how he used Scrivener</a> and Workflow to write and prepare his iOS 10 review.</p>
<p>Another simple workflow I&#8217;ve used is to convert a podcast to MP3 from Ferrite. Every episode of <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable</a> was recorded on the iPhone or iPad. At WWDC, I edited <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> on the iPad with the help of Ferrite and the web app Auphonic, which <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/08/ipad-podcast-post-production-with-auphonic/">Jason Snell has also written about</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I was able to export and upload The Incomparable while sitting at a comfortable table <a href="http://www.theblacksheep.com/">in an Ashland pub</a>, drinking their beer and using their free Wi-Fi. Auphonic did the rest, re-encoding the file as an MP3, tagging it properly, and uploading the result to both my Libsyn account and to The Incomparable’s FTP server.
</p></blockquote>
<p>When I was visiting a new coffee shop <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">every day for 30 days</a>, I loved taking the iPad with me because it was a lightweight, focused writing environment. With the right apps and workflows, it&#8217;s a fun computer to work on. I didn&#8217;t miss my Mac while traveling last week, and I expect iOS to serve me well on future trips.</p>
