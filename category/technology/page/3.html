			<p><a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/03/on-fighting-about-smartphones/">Stephen Hackett of 512 Pixels</a>, commenting on <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/?p=133719">a Wired essay by Mat Honan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Maybe it’s just the headache I’ve had since the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6GRFKWGn1k">Samsung Galaxy 4 event</a> or the fact that <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/why-iphone/">Apple’s turning up the heat</a>, but I find the increasingly defensive views held in the technology community increasingly offensive.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I got into the Mac in the 1990s during the lead-up to Apple’s certain doom, so I spent quite a lot of time arguing with Windows users. The problem with the new version of that debate, Apple vs. Samsung and the smartphone wars, is that <em>I’m not sure it’s ever going to end</em>. There are good phones on either side, the pundits can’t wait for Apple to fail but Apple is strong, and there’s no hope to escape the noise for those of us who just want to build some apps.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>David Smith on <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2013/03/21/purging-the-back-catalog/">cleaning up the App Store</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The App Store currently has around <a href="http://148apps.biz/app-store-metrics/?mpage=appcount">800k</a> active apps listed. I suspect a significant number of these haven’t been updated in more than 12 months. An app that is listed for sale but is no longer under active development creates the possibility for bad user experience. It is like a grocery store that leaves expired produce on its shelves.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He makes a good argument for removing old apps from the store, but I’d probably hesitate going all the way to actively take them out. There is certainly too much clutter in the App Store — too many apps that aren’t providing much value, some with little chance of an update. But I also dislike the already fragile state of App Store inventory. iOS apps require much more active maintenance than traditional, direct download Mac apps, which can be hosted anywhere and stay available without constant attention from the developer.</p>
<p>At one point <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/newdisruptors/14/">on episode 14 of The New Disruptors podcast</a>, Glenn Fleishman talked with John Gruber about apps as a unique art form unlike paintings or novels or even film because apps are never done. John Gruber from that show, talking about software:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “To me it is an art form. But it is the one thing that is continuously diddled with. You write a novel and it’s done, it’s out there. Once it’s published, it’s published. You make a movie, it’s done. George Lucas gets a lot of flak because he keeps revisiting his old Star Wars movies and making a change here and there, but it’s not like every year he comes out with a new version of Star Wars. […] But software — an app that has a vibrant and still-growing user base — it’s the same thing, constantly being iterated. It’s the only art form that is like that.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are always bugs, always missing features, and always (as is David’s point above) new hardware to adapt to. It’s an art form that won’t stay still, so maybe there is an inherent impermanence to it.</p>
<p>But if apps are an art form, an important part of our culture, then it shouldn’t require so much work to make sure they don’t disappear forever, so quickly. This happened to me just this week, actually. I forgot to renew my iOS developer program account and my apps were automatically removed from sale for a few hours while I scrambled to pay my $99 again.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s a compromise solution in here somewhere. Instead of being removed from sale, abandoned apps could switch to an archived state. They would no longer show up in top lists or even search, but could still be found with a direct link. With the right kind of fallback like that, Apple could be even more aggressive about gearing the App Store user experience around new apps and modern devices, without sacrificing what is good about the long tail of old apps.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>John Gruber has a series of posts questioning Apple’s judgement in hiring Kevin Lynch. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/19/exhibit-b">This one best sums it up</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I get that the guy worked for Adobe and had to play for the home team, but as CTO he backed a dying technology for years too long. In 2007 when the iPhone shipped Flash-free, that was one thing. But for Adobe to still be backing the Flash horse in 2010 when the iPad came out — they just looked silly.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>All of that is true. But instead of reflecting poor judgement, I think Kevin Lynch joining Apple could be good news in what it says about Apple. They didn’t hire him blindly. Apple knows what Kevin has been working on, knows what he’s said in public, and at this moment probably knows much better than we do what it was like to be at Adobe those last few years. For all we know Apple cares more about his work on Creative Cloud than Flash.</p>
<p><a href="http://klynch.com/">Kevin also has a rich history</a> that is closely tied with the Mac. He worked as a developer on FrameMaker. He worked at General Magic alongside old-school Apple engineers. He worked at Macromedia when they started building web tools.</p>
<p>I heard him speak much later at SXSW in 2002, for a joint presentation he gave with Jeffrey Veen. At the time I disagreed with Kevin’s vision for Flash and the web, but the SXSW talk was interesting enough that I <a href="http://manton.org/2003/03/flash_vs_web_apps.html">referenced it afterwards</a> and again <a href="http://manton.org/2004/03/sxsw_day_1_web.html">later</a>. Kevin was so good that he somehow demonstrated he got the web even as he pitched a product that was increasingly at odds with it.</p>
<p>Was he wrong about Flash? Yes. But I choose to view his move to Apple as an indication that he was at the wrong company more than that he was completely wrong-headed. Maybe it was time for something new, a course correction back to the earlier part of his career. Skepticism about this hire is fine, but to treat him as an outsider is to forget the other great things he’s worked on. Once you’ve built Mac software, no matter how long ago, you’ll always be one of us.</p>
<p>I hope Apple sees it that way too. Because if Apple is confident of anything, it’s that they can’t get stuck in one old way of thinking, can’t discount good people because of one unforgivable bad idea. That Apple is able to brush aside the Flash debate as yesterday’s news — even accept as a VP someone who was at the heart of that debate, and on the wrong side — shows to me that they’re only looking forward.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://rightapp.tumblr.com/post/40671466986/the-etiquette-of-app-net">Phillip Gruneich has an interesting post</a> about what’s different about ADN, with thoughts on the global feed and link posting:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “App.net is a different environment and it must be preserved that way. If you get into it and decide to behave like it is a Twitter alternative, then the differences will fade away and we’ll lose a precious experience.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are some ideas in here that surprised me. For example, I’m not sure I agree that everyone reads the global feed, nor that people should be discouraged from linking to anything but their own work. I love to post links to products from friends and companies that are doing interesting things.</p>
<p>Even if it isn’t as busy as on Twitter — Twitter disabled their global feed years ago when it started moving too fast to be read — it would still be difficult to do anything more than occasionally skim the global feed on ADN.</p>
<p>He does hit on something important, though. Because it’s a paid service, and there’s a cost to additional accounts, most of the users are actual people. There are fewer companies and parody accounts. (But I did end up getting <a href="https://alpha.app.net/riverfold">@riverfold on ADN</a>, which I felt was a nice compromise when compared against my 4-5 app accounts on Twitter.)</p>
<p>So I might not use ADN in exactly the same way that Phillip does, but the hope that ADN remains unique is the same because it’s something nearly everyone on ADN probably hopes for. And that’s the really good news: if what makes ADN special is the people, then it’s because all of the people have something in common. They didn’t chose ADN by accident, or because it was the default choice. They chose it because <em>they wanted something better</em>.</p>
<p>In the short 5 months since <a href="../../../2012/08/appnets_great.html">I wrote about ADN’s start</a>, I’ve become a big fan of the founders, the quality of the API and developer program, and the general tone of ADN users. There might not be a single best way to use ADN, and that will become even more true over time as the scope of the API grows. But there’s no question that it is a special service that deserves to be a peer with Twitter and Facebook in terms of new apps and conversations, even as it exists in a different world where huge “1 billion user” scale doesn’t matter.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Over three months ago I stopped using Twitter. I wanted to make a statement — perhaps in an overly-dramatic way — that the developer-hostile environment that Twitter had evolved into wasn’t something I could support anymore. I do still read plenty of tweets while testing <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>, and I’m almost done with a new version of <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>, because my customers deserve great Twitter features. But I haven’t tweeted, retweeted, or favorited a thing from my personal account since October 5th.</p>
<p>I knew that sometimes it would be difficult to resist going back to Twitter, replying to a question, or cross-posting my posts from App.net. So I set things up to discourage my future self from even considering more tweeting. I picked the 1-year anniversary of the day Steve Jobs died and <a href="http://watermark.io/collections/manton/myfinaltweets">wrote my final tweets</a> a week in advance. If someone visits my profile, I want those statements to be what they see. I can’t tweet again without pushing those tweets from the top of the list.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, App.net started taking off. Netbot shipped. The <a href="http://blog.app.net/2012/09/27/announcing-the-app-net-developer-incentive-program/">developer incentive program</a> started to directly reward developers. There’s a good community there. It’s smaller than on Twitter; there isn’t the same never-ending stream of tweets flowing into your timeline. But maybe that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>The flip side is that it’s hard to let go of things like Twitter that have value. I had similar self-doubt when I killed off my app Wii Transfer, so that I could focus on bigger ideas. But simplifying has allowed me to do some of the best work of my career in 2012. I’ve put everything I have into Watermark, into the new Tweet Marker subscriptions, into doing Core Intuition weekly, into <a href="../../../2012/06/ship_everything.html">shipping everything I work on</a>. 2013 is going to be awesome, and I’m not looking back.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/11/11/innovation_is_a_fight.html">Great essay from Rands</a> on Scott Forstall. It’s one of the first I’ve seen to capture what made Forstall valuable to innovation at Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “While I’d continued to hear about the disdain amongst the executive ranks about Forstall after I left Apple, I was still shocked about his departure, because while he was in no way Steve Jobs, he was the best approximation of Steve Jobs that Apple had left. You came to expect a certain amount of disruption around him because that’s how business was done at Apple — it was well-managed internal warfare. Innovation is not born out out of a committee; innovation is a fight.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>One part of this executive shakeup that had me puzzled was the rumor that Scott Forstall refused to sign an apology letter about iOS 6 Maps. We’ve had a few open letters from Steve Jobs, and now one from Tim Cook. It seemed out of character to have a VP do it, someone who’s lesser known to the general public.</p>
<p>But then I ran across <a href="http://www.apple.com/environment/letter-to-customers/">this letter about EPEAT from Bob Mansfield</a> again, posted just a few months ago. It is signed only by Mansfield. It starts:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We’ve recently heard from many loyal Apple customers who were disappointed to learn that we had removed our products from the EPEAT rating system. I recognize that this was a mistake. Starting today, all eligible Apple products are back on EPEAT.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words: we’re listening, we’re sorry, and here’s what we’re doing to set things right. And I think that’s Tim Cook’s Apple. Proud and passionate about the products they’ve built, definitely, but always sincere. Arrogance has no place.</p>

			<p>From <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/10/ipad_mini">John Gruber’s iPad Mini review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “If the Mini had a retina display, I’d switch from the iPad 3 in a heartbeat. As it stands, I’m going to switch anyway. Going non-retina is a particularly bitter pill for me, but I like the iPad Mini’s size and weight so much that I’m going to swallow it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I said on <a href="http://coreint.org/64">the last Core Intuition</a>, it’s even more of an easy switch for me since I never upgraded to the iPad 3. The iPad Mini has essentially been my only iPad for the last week. I’m using it more, and taking it places that I would’ve have bothered with before. My new favorite Apple device.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Today, <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/we-did-it">App.net passed its $500,000 funding goal</a>. A few weeks ago when I signed up with my $50, I didn&#8217;t think they could do it. And Daniel and I were both pessimistic about their chances when we talked about it on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2012/07/episode-50-dont-get-too-attached/">Core Intuition 50</a>.</p>
<p>In less than a month, they went from a mission statement video that seemed just a step away from vaporware, to following through on an API spec and then alpha version web site. They delivered. The momentum of <em>shipping something real</em> brought in new users and drove them to the finish.</p>
<p>What I love most about App.net is the transparency. Founder Dalton Caldwell is a blogger, like one of us. Where we only hear from Twitter&#8217;s CEO, Dick Costolo, through big news publications or at conference keynotes, for Dalton we hear it directly from his own blog posts, the way a small company should communicate. Being on the ground in posts and tweets is a perfect complement to his goal of treating users and developers as real customers.</p>
<p>App.net will never overtake Twitter. Look no further than hashtags all over the Olympics as proof of that. But App.net can put pressure on Twitter to respect third-party developers, and with thousands of paying customers, all with a vested interest in making App.net something worthwhile, App.net has already surpassed every other Twitter clone that has tried and failed to build a community.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html">Paul Graham&#8217;s essay on ambitious startup ideas</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers use. A search engine whose users consisted of the top 10,000 hackers and no one else would be in a very powerful position despite its small size, just as Google was when it was that search engine. […]</p>
<p>  &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry if something you want to do will constrain you in the long term, because if you don&#8217;t get that initial core of users, there won&#8217;t be a long term. If you can just build something that you and your friends genuinely prefer to Google, you&#8217;re already about 10% of the way to an IPO, just as Facebook was (though they probably didn&#8217;t realize it) when they got all the Harvard undergrads.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s talking about search engines, but it could be anything. Get those 10,000 passionate users and you have a chance to take on the giants in the industry. As of this writing, App.net has 8000 paying customers. And 25% of them signed up at the developer tier. I&#8217;m sure every developer with a popular Twitter app has already looked at the App.net API documentation.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/234709098124414976">John Siracusa tweeted</a> after App.net successfully funded: &#8220;Now comes the hard part.&#8221; Totally true, but just reaching this point was difficult — a perfect mix of great timing and even better execution. In the first 30 days, we saw a team that knows how to win. Let&#8217;s see what they can do next.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>This is kind of a short, technical footnote to <a href="../../../2012/07/permanence.html">my last essay</a>. There I linked to an older blog post from Dave Winer, just one of many of his on this subject. Today <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/07/20/moreOnLocAndTwitter.html">he writes how we should archive blogs</a> before we worry about Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With Twitter there’s a rich corporation minding it. They can and imho should be funding their own archive. But with the historic blogosphere, dating back to the early-mid 90s, <em>a lot of it is already gone</em>. The need to preserve it, by independent historians and librarians, is greater than the need for Twitter to be publicly archived.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a lot to say on this, and I can&#8217;t wait to share a new web project that I started recently which could play a small roll in blog backups. When I killed off my little app Wii Transfer, I did so to <a href="../../../2012/05/saying_goodbye_to.html">refocus Riverfold around preservation</a>. I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It also doesn’t fit into a new theme I have for Riverfold: apps that are all about keeping and remembering what matters. For Clipstart, that’s family videos. For Tweet Library and Tweet Marker Plus, that’s old tweets.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Dave mentions libraries several times in his blog post. It’s no accident that the word “library” is in Tweet Library’s name; my ambition for this app far outpaces my coding speed. But blogs are a different problem, and they need something special — perhaps multiple solutions.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>It usually takes a couple problems hitting at once to cause a major server outage. This happened last week when Tweet Marker&#8217;s SSL certificate expired. I have the SSL set to auto-renew, but it still requires manually installing the new certificate, and other problems happened along the way.</p>
<p>First mistake: I didn&#8217;t realize it was expiring. Those emails go to an account I don&#8217;t check very often, littered with spam. And the email to confirm the renewal went to yet another email address that no longer worked. When I had moved the DNS hosting to Amazon&#8217;s Route 53, I had neglected to move over the MX records.</p>
<p>After fixing all of that, I tried updating the app on Heroku to use the new cert, only to get stalled as Heroku&#8217;s new SSL add-on rejected it. Certain I had done something wrong, I fumbled through a dozen Heroku SSL how-to posts before finally reverting to their old SSL add-on. It&#8217;s no longer documented and is in fact actively discouraged by Heroku, but it also has the lucky trait of <em>actually working</em> with my certificate. Updating DNS caused another hour-long delay because of the high TTL.</p>
<p>I sent two support requests during this process, so I thought I&#8217;d rate how each company did:</p>
<ul>
<li>DreamHost: Before I figured out the bad email address, I sent DreamHost a question about why the SSL certificate hadn&#8217;t showed up yet. They responded very quickly, and even included a &#8220;P.S.&#8221; that they were fans of Tweet Marker. Basically they provided excellent support, the best you could ask for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heroku: When the new SSL add-on wasn&#8217;t accepting my certificate, I filed a support request with Heroku as well. The response was an automated reply that they don&#8217;t do support past 6pm. For a hosting company that charges a premium, this was a disappointing response. (They responded first thing the next morning, though.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This SSL glitch was the only significant outage Tweet Marker has had in its first year. I learned a few lessons, took the opportunity to check backups and EC2 servers, and now I&#8217;m ready to move on. Hoping for an even better year 2.</p>

			<p>From a great story on Mark Zuckerberg <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/mark-zuckerberg-2012-5/">in New York Magazine</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “‘Mark has done two things in his twenties,’ a colleague of Zuckerberg says. ‘He has built a global company, and he has grown up.’ The second one made the first possible. When early mistakes risked an employee mutiny, Zuckerberg knuckled down and learned how to lead.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It covers founding the company, Sean Parker, other execs, the Instagram purchase, and more. I’ve got new respect for what Zuckerberg has accomplished after reading this.</p>
<p>Several years ago, when Yahoo or Microsoft or whomever was rumored to have offered a billion dollars to buy Facebook, I thought Zuckerberg was foolish and arrogant for not selling the company. I didn’t get how it could be a real business, ever worth more. Looks like I was wrong.</p>
<p>Of course, the narrative of the last week is that the IPO disappointed, with the stock steadily falling since its debut. But that&#8217;s only relevant if you want a quick win. The long-term view says that Facebook is here to stay, and that the company&#8217;s growth is a reason to celebrate. Not for the service or founders, but for the success of so many great developers and designers who are now part of the public company: Instagram, Gowalla, Push Pop Press, Sofa, and others who are working inside Facebook, trying to build something great.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>There has been some good commentary on &#8220;Sergey Brin&#8217;s interview&#8221;:http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/15/web-freedom-threat-google-brin with the Guardian. It&#8217;s probably best summarized in &#8220;John Gruber&#8217;s comment&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/15/google-open-web:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The assumption here is that the only way to search is through Google, and that the &#8216;open Internet&#8217; is only what Google can index and sell ads against.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This resonates with me because I think Google has put enough ads on the internet. It&#8217;s impossible to take anything Google says at face value if they talk of &#8220;open&#8221; but their intentions say &#8220;ads&#8221;. But here&#8217;s the thing: Brin is actually right. There <em>is</em> great data hidden behind apps that should be indexable.</p>
<p>In the race to win the App Store, we forgot about the web. Think about Instagram. Millions of photos are being shared that are inaccessible via a search engine. These photos can&#8217;t be found again and aren&#8217;t discoverable. When you search the web, how does it make sense that public photos on Flickr show up, but public photos on Instagram do not?</p>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t have to choose between Apple&#8217;s closed systems and Google&#8217;s ad-driven business. I want to talk about improving the web without automatically being pro-Google. &#8220;This tweet from John Marstall&#8221;:https://twitter.com/iconmaster/status/191901693527605248 made me realize it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;d prefer to separate &#8216;indexable&#8217; from &#8216;indexable by Google.&#8217; Yes, they&#8217;re mostly the same for now. Might not always be.&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>We need competition in web search. More than Bing. A new search engine is the number 1 item from &#8220;Paul Graham&#8217;s frighteningly ambitious ideas&#8221;:http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The best ideas are just on the right side of impossible. I don&#8217;t know if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be. Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and recently I&#8217;ve noticed some cracks in their fortress.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s crazy, but so was the 1st search breakthrough, lightning-fast AltaVista, and so was the 2nd major innovation, Google itself. It&#8217;s time for a search engine that isn&#8217;t all about ads. It&#8217;s time for search that understands apps and embraces data from web services as much as it does from web sites. It&#8217;s time for the 3rd act in search.</p>

			<p>I love reading about how big sites use Amazon EC2. If &#8220;this post from Instagram&#8221;:http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of is still accurate, they must be at something like $50k/month in hosting costs. Their user base has doubled in the 4 months since they posted that.</p>
<p>My setup for Tweet Marker is trivial by comparison, but to me &mdash; without Instagram&#8217;s $7 million in funding &mdash; it&#8217;s a very big deal. What I wrote &#8220;back in October&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/10/redisonly_migration.html about moving to Redis is still mostly true, although I&#8217;ve added MySQL and Sphinx to the mix. I now run with 3 Amazon EC2 &#8220;medium&#8221; instances and have 5 web dynos (with 3 Unicorn processes each) at Heroku.</p>
<p>I put everything from donations back into the servers. For Tweet Marker to work, it had to be rock solid. It had to scale. It&#8217;s only the first week for &#8220;Tweet Marker Plus&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/plus subscriptions, but already I have a good feeling that it&#8217;ll all pay off.</p>

			<p>A few times since it launched, I&#8217;ve said to friends that Tweet Marker may be the best thing I&#8217;ve done. It has reached more users than any of my indie Mac and iOS apps, and it has been especially rewarding to work with other Twitter developers. It&#8217;s not perfect yet &mdash; there&#8217;s more to improve in future versions of the API and clients &mdash; but I smile every time I see a tweet about how someone can&#8217;t imagine going back to a Twitter client without it.</p>
<p>So it was really gratifying to see &#8220;Macworld recognize Tweet Marker with an Editors&#8217; Choice Award&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/163951/2011/12/the_27th_annual_editors_choice_awards.html for 2011. Thank you Macworld for seeing Tweet Marker as an important part of the Twitter experience.</p>
<p>And thanks to &#8220;all the Twitter app developers&#8221;:http://twitter.com/#!/manton/status/143729811406331905 who have supported Tweet Marker in their apps. We are up to 9 supporting apps across 5 platforms &mdash; Mac, iPhone, iPad, Chrome, and Android &mdash; with more on the way. I&#8217;ve opened up the API to over 40 different clients in various stages of research or testing.</p>
<p>Tweet Marker is a little unique among most of the other Eddy winners this year in that it&#8217;s still completely free. I won&#8217;t see a sales spike following the announcement. If you&#8217;ve been enjoying the service, consider picking up a copy of my iPad app Tweet Library, or donating directly &#8220;on the site&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/.</p>

			<p>The second app to support &#8220;Tweet Marker&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/ has arrived, and it&#8217;s a great one: &#8220;Tweetbot&#8221;:http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/. I love using Tweetbot on the iPhone and Twitterrific on the Mac and iPad. Seeing these apps work together just makes for a better Twitter experience.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind while using apps that support Tweet Marker:</p>
<p><em>Turn it on!</em> First things first: enable Tweet Marker in both apps on every device you plan to use Twitter on. MacStories has a good summary of this (with screenshots) for &#8220;their coverage of Twitterrific&#8221;:http://www.macstories.net/mac/twitterrific-4-3-syncs-timeline-position-with-tweet-marker/ and &#8220;again for Tweetbot&#8221;:http://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-1-6-gets-tweet-marker-timeline-sync/.</p>
<p><em>What syncs?</em> Only the main timeline and mentions sync between the apps. While working with these developers, we made a decision to change how Twitter lists sync after Twitterrific had already shipped. So while both apps think they are syncing lists, the format on the server is not compatible between the two. A future version should fix this.</p>
<p><em>How to switch apps?</em> Most apps take the approach of saving the last-read position when the app is quit or sent to the background, and restoring it again when it is launched or brought to the front. You may need to change your default habits a little to get the most accurate behavior. When you know you are going to switch apps, just close your active Twitter client first before opening the next one. It may also help to wait for the app to download new tweets before scrolling or interacting with it.</p>

			<p>Five years ago today, I joined Twitter as its 897th user, though for some reason &#8220;my first tweet&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/1457463 wasn&#8217;t until a few months later. So much has changed in the meantime &mdash; the API always in flux, the transition from primarily SMS, to web, to apps &mdash; but in many ways the core of the service remains intact and stronger than ever. Short messages, distributed efficiently to friends.</p>
<p>I talked about some of the good and bad of being a Twitter developer &#8220;on the ATX Web Show last week&#8221;:http://atxwebshow.com/2011/07/05/episode-34-tweet-library-with-manton/. There have been a string of changes that cause developers to scramble: turning off basic auth, discouraging mainstream clients, disabling DMs for xAuth. With each step, Twitter loses a little goodwill, and that&#8217;s demonstrated in the tweets I &#8220;collected over the xAuth change&#8221;:http://tweetlibrary.com/manton/xauthtooauth.</p>
<p>Even as Twitter passes 1 million registered apps, there&#8217;s a risk that some developers will stick with the platform as users only, putting their apps in maintenance mode. In May, &#8220;Kiwi developer Isaiah stopped development&#8221;:http://yourhead.tumblr.com/post/5550105265/i-love-you-kiwi-i-know of his Mac Twitter app:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just going to take a break from Kiwi for a while. It&#8217;s still for sale. I still support it. I&#8217;ll still fix bugs when they crop up. But adding new features and playing catch up with the other guys/gals is off the table.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe because I don&#8217;t have to depend on Tweet Library sales, I tend to more stubbornly ignore what is good business sense. There&#8217;s so much I still want to do. As &#8220;I wrote in my previous take&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/03/twitters.html on the state of the platform: &#8220;I&#8217;m a little discouraged, but not enough to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s doubly true today. More annoyed, but also more determined to plug holes in the platform, from archiving to syncing. I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about the developers who are building in &#8220;Tweet Marker&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/ support.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s always a chance, a feeling that something big is just around the corner. That if I don&#8217;t add that one feature, or open up that new API, I&#8217;ll miss the tipping point that makes Tweet Library really take off.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m fascinated with the iPad &#8220;3&#8221; rumors because on the surface they make so little sense. Apple just shipped the iPad 2, no competitors can match it, and demand is strong. Why mess with a good thing so soon?</p>
<p>But it almost fits when <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/11/ipad-pro">you give it a name like &#8220;Pro&#8221;</a> (or iPad Retina, or whatever). This isn&#8217;t a replacement for the current iPad; it&#8217;s another layer to the product lineup. And like the awkwardly-named iPod Photo from 2004, I bet the iPad Pro is meant to be temporary. It&#8217;s a way to sell a high-end, over-priced and over-pixeled iPad before the technology is cheap enough for the masses. A year or two from now, the Retina Display will be available in all iPads, and the &#8220;Pro&#8221; name will fade away, just like iPod Photo did when all iPods got a color screen.</p>

			<p>I hadn&#8217;t yet read &#8220;Neven Mrgan&#8217;s post&#8221;:http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/3451376797/30 when I wrote &#8220;my own&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/02/30_of_the.html yesterday, but he strikes one of the same themes I closed with:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But with this 30% thing, the 30% I&#8217;m really interested in is, will Apple eventually see 30% of its revenue come from various cuts, percentages, deals, and obligations? If so, that means a different focus for the company &mdash; a focus on things and people farther removed from me and you. And that makes me a bit bummed out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, neither of us is filling in for Steve Jobs, and Apple <em>can</em> do anything they want within the law. But what Neven captures so well here is that many of us hold Apple to a higher standard because Apple has a history of creating great things. This 30% business model doesn&#8217;t seem to have any place in that history.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I believe the iPad is the future of mainstream computing, not just of mobile devices. That&#8217;s why I picked it as the first platform for Tweet Library. But forcing developers to use in-app purchase shows that Apple&#8217;s version of success for the iPad looks much different than mine.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s tight control over iOS has always been troubling. If there&#8217;s no way to install an app on the device without Apple&#8217;s approval, then Apple can make or break any business that builds for the platform. It&#8217;s an added risk for the thousands of tiny development shops for which the iPhone and iPad are otherwise perfect.</p>
<p>There was such huge growth in the development community because of iOS that I&#8217;m not sure anyone was paying attention to where we&#8217;d end up. We saw a new phone instead of the future of computing. We saw the gold rush but not the damage, so we let it happen. We let it happen by not sending Apple a clear message: total control over distribution is bad for developers and bad for users.</p>
<p>And now we&#8217;re letting Apple take 30% from every company that wants an iOS app to complement their business, whether it has anything to do with software development or not.</p>
<p>From &#8220;Matt Drance&#8221;:http://www.appleoutsider.com/2011/02/22/omgiapbbq/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Whatever the fine print says, Apple is no longer letting developers do things it had been letting them do &mdash; and build businesses on &mdash; for almost two years, and many developers are quite understandably upset about that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And &#8220;Marco Arment&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/3437484678:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A broad, vague, inconsistently applied, greedy, and unjustifiable rule doesn&#8217;t make developers want to embrace the platform.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope we&#8217;re wrong about the worst-case interpretation &mdash; I like &#8220;this Steve Jobs email&#8221;:http://www.macrumors.com/2011/02/21/steve-jobs-email-suggests-in-app-subscriptions-dont-apply-to-software-as-a-service/ much more than &#8220;the reality of Readability&#8217;s rejection&#8221;:http://blog.readability.com/2011/02/an-open-letter-to-apple/ &mdash; but because Apple fails so spectacularly at communication we won&#8217;t know for sure until more rejections come in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not comfortable with a future in which 30 cents on the dollar goes to a single company, no matter whether it&#8217;s from app downloads (where Apple offers hosting and discovery) or content sales and web service subscriptions (where Apple offers little). If the iPad grows like many of us expect it to, siphoning a third of the cash flow around <em>everyday computers</em> will create a completely different economic environment than exists today. It&#8217;s unprecedented.</p>
<p>And it would ruin Apple. Not the company&#8217;s finances, but its focus. John Gruber &#8220;wonders what he&#8217;s missing&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/02/21/readability, and this is it: Apple is embracing a model that is fine for Readability but runs counter to Apple&#8217;s core business. The iTunes Music Store wasn&#8217;t a business in its own right; it helped sell more iPods. The App Store shouldn&#8217;t be a huge revenue stream; it makes the iPhone and iPad better.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s strength has always been selling a great product to end users &mdash; &#8220;the rest of us&#8221;. The new Apple has fallen into the trap of thinking they should also be an advertising company and an overpriced payment processor. It&#8217;s a slippery slope from here to becoming just another mega-corp that has their hands in everything that can make money instead of &#8220;standing for something&#8221;:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oAB83Z1ydE.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>With the recent release of &#8220;The Daily&#8221;:http://www.thedaily.com/ and the news of &#8220;Sony&#8217;s e-book app rejection&#8221;:http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/02/change-in-apple-policy-has-e-book-fans-worried-about-their-apps.ars, there&#8217;s speculation that Apple will change the rules around iOS in-app purchases. The 30% cut makes it difficult for some businesses to move to the App Store without passing a cost increase on to customers.</p>
<p>Other than &#8220;no change&#8221;, I&#8217;ve only heard two possible solutions:</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Special deals for the big guys.</em> Amazon and other retailers could negotiate lower rates. But as Marco mentioned on &#8220;Build and Analyze&#8221;:http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/11, the App Store treats large and small developers as equals. It&#8217;s a real strength that a 2-person game company can compete with Electronic Arts. I hope we never lose that.</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Lower percentage for everyone.</em> Not going to happen. Take an app like Twitterrific. I consider it a $5 app, but to the store it&#8217;s actually a free app with a $5 in-app upgrade. Lowering the in-app cut would encourage many previously paid apps to convert to free and pay less to Apple.</p>
<p>This is why I believe the only option is for Apple to <em>distinguish between in-app content and features</em>. Content purchases, such as e-books or virtual game items, would be in one class of payment. Feature upgrades, such as unlocking core functionality in the app, would continue to be 30%, same as paid downloads.</p>
<p>Is it confusing for developers? Is it totally subjective and up to the judgement of the review team? Yes. Welcome to the App Store.</p>
