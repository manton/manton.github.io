				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Before <a href="http://www.revolution60.com/page2/index.php?id=84850310691">some of the recent discussion</a> about the future of App.net, <a href="https://alpha.app.net/walruscp/post/25988120">Colin Pekruhn asked a question</a>, directed at Ben Brooks and me, about whether we’d go back to Twitter if App.net failed. My answer (and his) was a very clear “no”. Here’s what I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I’m very stubborn and not going to reverse my decision on Twitter. If ADN fails I’ll blog more.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The stubbornness deserves a little more explanation. Because programmers are pretty opinionated folks. When we feel strongly about an approach — to languages, to UI design, to backend architectures, anything — we’ll plant our feet in the ground and argue with coworkers about the right way to do things. And it’s easy to dig in, start coming up with more justifications for a choice before taking a second look and seeing if it’s actually the right thing, or whether we’re just fighting for something because we want to get our way.</p>
<p>I put a lot of thought into no longer posting to Twitter. I often bring up my low Twitter user ID (#897) because I think it helps underscore that I’ve been on the service a long time. I get the history of it. I was there when it was all done over SMS with my dumb Nokia phone. I had fun with early experiments on the platform, like my sadly abandoned <a href="http://story140.com/">@story140 account</a>, my <a href="http://wiitransfer.com/codes/">@wii codes service</a>, the <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker API</a>, and of course the two products I continue to support to this day: <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>.</p>
<p>I stopped posting because at some point the anti-developer attitude at Twitter became too much. The limits on user auth tokens, which have already killed a few popular third-party Twitter apps; the problems with shutting down IFTTT recipes; the guidelines that restricted how you could use your own tweets. This is all fairly well documented and I’ve written about it before. I leave my personal account silent as a small protest.</p>
<p>I knew leaving would be difficult, so I set up a series of posts to discourage my future self from ever joining again. <a href="http://watermark.io/collections/manton/myfinaltweets">My final tweets</a> were timed to go out on the anniversary of Steve Jobs’s death. They’re a collected moment, a tribute to both Steve and how great Twitter could be. I like that they’re forever pinned at the top of my profile page.</p>
<p>The best programmers aren’t so proud that they won’t admit when they’re wrong. There’s a time to fight for what you believe in — your coworkers don’t agree with how you want to build that feature, but maybe they just don’t see it clearly yet — and there is a time to admit you made the wrong call and move on. Saying “I was wrong, let’s do it your way” is a powerful statement and moves a project forward. I never want to ignore Twitter just because I’m so stubborn I refuse to admit I overreacted and that it’s time to crawl back to Twitter and accept defeat.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: <em>I wasn’t wrong</em>. Every reason I gave above for leaving Twitter is still valid. I have friends at Twitter doing great work — it’s truly incredible what they’ve built, from scaling the backend to how the iOS app works — but Twitter is too big and successful to change now. We can’t rewind the clock to when Twitter was a tiny company that cared more about developers than advertisers, so I won’t be back.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Yesterday <a href="http://firesid.es/Chat/billkunz">Bill Kunz was interviewed on Firesides</a>, talking about his app Felix, and life as an indie developer vs. at a startup. Bill was especially open about how he used his own savings to build Felix, and some of the planning problems he ran into:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “One thing I would do differently &#8211; and this is probably going to come out wrong &#8211; but I would have stuck to my guns on my own plans better. I added quite a few niche features that ultimately ended up not being used, when I could have spent that time on the core of the app, or other projects. I burned a lot, lot, lot of time on things I ultimately didn’t need to.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Firesides is a very nice use of App.net. You can browse chat transcripts from previous guests without signing in, or sign in with App.net to ask questions when there’s a chat taking place. It’s a little like Reddit’s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/">Ask Me Anything</a>, but more readable and visually appealing, and built on the App.net messaging platform.</p>

			<p><a href="http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/429">Guy English writes</a> about why Apple was questioned on the fingerprint sensor in the iPhone 5S but Samsung wasn’t for their new phone. I like this part about holding Apple to a higher standard:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Apple is held to a higher standard of conduct. They’ve spent years, countless hours of hard work, and untold advertising dollars, to earn that expectation. They have it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Expecting the best from a company isn’t unfair; it’s a form of respect. We want Apple to be amazing, and when they fall a little short, we’re disappointed. If they disappoint too many times in a row, we’ll no longer expect greatness. That that hasn’t happened yet says everything about quality at Apple.</p>

  “My worry about the future is an <em>Amazon</em> monopoly on cloud services. Amazon’s services are fantastic, and they’ve changed how people make web apps. But they should not be the only game in town.”

<p>I agree. When AWS goes down now, it seems like half the internet doesn’t work. Except for a few lingering DNS entries, I moved everything from Amazon to Linode last year in a cost-cutting attempt. But even better, I’d like to run some of my services across multiple cloud providers. That’s difficult to manage today as a one-man shop.</p>

			<p>I’ve been slowly moving photos to Dropbox over the last year, using the Dropbox camera import feature so that all new photos from my phone get synced up automatically. It’s worked out so well that last week I decided to go all in. I moved about 13 years of photos there and upgraded to Dropbox’s 200 GB of storage.</p>
<p>In the process I’ve been poking around at old photos, photos of my kids from 6-7 years ago when we had a basic point-and-shoot camera. There are some great photos in there, but also so many that are blurry or out of focus. We were too cheap to buy a good camera at the time. Now I would pay any amount of money to go back in time and reshoot the photos with a better camera.</p>
<p><a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2013/12/so_i_got_my_first_dslr.html">Gus Mueller learned this lesson</a> more quickly than I did:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It’s quite amazing what a difference a nice lens and a nice camera can do. Kirstin was shocked at the quality. The cameras on iPhones are getting better, but they don’t hold a candle to camera tech today.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>We don’t use our DSLR every day. It’s for big events, birthdays, school performances, and the iPhone suffices for the rest of the time. But it’s worth every penny and more, to look back on these photos years later and know we have captured them at their best.</p>
<p>Photos are also at the heart of my new app, <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a>. We’ll be shipping soon. Enter your email address on the site to be notified when it hits the App Store.</p>

								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Apple has produced some amazing ads over the years. 1984, introducing the original Mac; the Think Different campaign; and one of my favorite this year, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoVW62mwSQQ">about photos</a>.</p>
<p>Their new ad “Misunderstood” is also great. <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-airs-iphone-5s-holiday-commercial-featuring-airplay/">Federico Viticci has a rundown</a> of the details and how brilliantly it unfolds. I first noticed the video via Neven Mrgan, who had <a href="https://alpha.app.net/mrgan/post/17528712">this to say on App.net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Apple’s new ad (‘Misunderstood’) is technically perfect: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImlmVqH_5HM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImlmVqH_5HM</a> …but I have to say it doesn’t quite ring true to me. Kids use iPhones to shut out the family and hang out within their own social circle (and that’s ok).”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s right. My daughters will likely escape to Instagram and various chat apps to connect with their friends through the holidays. But also I think ads like this work so well not because they represent reality, not because they’re true, but because we want them to be.</p>

<p>I ordered my retina iPad Mini with T-Mobile, hoping to take advantage of their free 200 MB of data per month. Since most of the time I’m at home on wi-fi, I figured the savings for all the months that I don’t need even 200 MB would more than offset the extra $130 cost of buying the cellular version of iPad.</p>
<p>I had three primary use cases in mind: the occasional commute on the train to work at coffee shops downtown, when it’s nice to be connected but the train wi-fi doesn’t cut it; swim meets and other kid activities with very long downtime, again without need for a laptop but it might be nice to catch up on some writing or RSS feeds; and road trips, lonely stretches of the highway where I’m technically on vacation but still need to check in on email, chat, or App.net.</p>
<p>I got home from the Apple Store, excitedly opened the box, restored my iPad from iCloud, tapped to set up a new T-Mobile plan, and&#8230; immediately wished I had chosen Verizon instead. Because the first thing I saw was an error that the web site wasn’t working. T-Mobile is smallest of the big carriers, and the error made me doubt that T-Mobile had the coverage or competence to make this work.</p>
<p>I followed up the poor first impression by searching the internet for similar problems that other T-Mobile customers might have run into. Sure enough, it was common weeks earlier during the iPad Air rollout, and T-Mobile still hadn’t fixed it. The workaround was simply to disable wi-fi during setup, forcing the connection to go through T-Mobile’s network.</p>
<p>A week later I gave the network its first real test on the road. Checking email, looking up maps and directions, writing, even a little streaming video for the kids.</p>
<p>The coverage between major cities wasn’t good. The iPad Mini was often on Edge where my iPhone 4S on AT&amp;T had 4G. It worked, but would frequently drop and reconnect. Sometimes I’d get lucky and find a spot of LTE for a little while, and it was a beautiful thing, while it lasted. Other times it was all but unusable.</p>
<p>The good news is that “200 MB free” is not a marketing gimmick. No strings attached, no credit card required, and no phone plan needed; it really is free cell data. The cost is dealing with a company that wants desperately to “get” iOS but isn’t quite there, and poor connectivity between cities compared to AT&amp;T. But after a rough start, I have no regrets. I’m typing this on my iPad along I-10 somewhere between Austin and Orlando, and that’s priceless indeed.</p>

			<p><a href="http://brooksreview.net/2013/07/coffee-shops-look-to-oust-laptop-hobos/">Ben Brooks makes several good arguments</a> for working from coffee shops:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Coffee Shops started sprouting up <em>everywhere</em> in the U.S. because of massive demand for the coffee shop — not massive demand for coffee, mind you, but for the seats <em>in</em> the shops. This is evident with the way most shops are setup, but no more evidence needed than to look at the move of Starbucks providing free WiFi, instead of paid WiFi they started with.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. There’s no sense in fighting this trend, and the coffee shops that do will largely fail. But also, as customers, we should be careful not to abuse the privilege. I try to follow these simple rules when working from a coffee shop:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t take up more space than I need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there’s a line, I usually wait until after I place my order before claiming a chair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For local small businesses especially, I leave a tip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a few hours, I order another coffee or wrap up and leave.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ben also points to <a href="https://alpha.app.net/cjchilvers/post/7541978">a post from CJ Chilvers</a> about libraries. I worked from my neighborhood library earlier this week — it’s a really nice, quiet environment — but the Austin libraries don’t allow you to bring any drinks inside yet, let alone have an on-site espresso machine. While traveling in Oregon a couple years ago, I remember the <a href="http://www.eugene-or.gov/index.aspx?NID=130">Eugene public library</a> having a really nice cafe and I was immediately jealous.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  “What really upsets me is that the archived events will soon be taken offline, and with no way to back it up. Ten years of history will be gone in 11 days. Good URLs never die, and I’m frustrated that every link to Upcoming will soon 404.”

<p>These kind of archive purges, whether through negligence or purpose, seem to be coming at an increasing rate. Last year <a href="http://manton.org/2012/08/when_it.html">it was Digg</a>. Now Upcoming.org. Even <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/15/formspring-the-pioneering-anonymous-qa-platform-is-shutting-down/">Formspring is shutting down</a> and deleting all 4 billion posts. And I’m sure there were a dozen lesser-known companies in between.</p>
<p>Luckily there’s a new effort to download the Upcoming archive with <a href="https://github.com/mroth/upcoming-cloud-warrior/">this GitHub project</a>. It makes it easier to spin up multiple Heroku instances to get around Yahoo’s IP address rate limiting. <a href="http://waxy.org/2013/04/how_you_can_save_upcoming/">Andy has an update</a> on this project and the folks behind it: Archive Team.

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>There were a couple special essays on Macworld recently — guest posts from the developer community. <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2031592/apple-fans-microsoft-is-no-longer-the-enemy.html">First Brent Simmons</a>, who argues that Microsoft isn’t the enemy anymore:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The threat to Macintosh was not that Windows machines were cheaper, or that people had bad taste—the biggest reason was that they worked with everything. That was why Apple asked Microsoft in 1997 to continue developing Office for Macs, so we could at least say you could run Word and Excel on Macs. […] But, these days, <em>everything</em> works with everything.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2033728/apple-unfortunately-no-longer-the-underdog.html">followed by Cabel Sasser</a>, with a similar theme:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I sometimes very awkwardly find myself rooting for Microsoft, Nokia—anybody—to put up a good fight and keep that fire burning under Apple’s collective behind. The smartest, most incredible people work in Cupertino, and their capabilities are boundless and their drive is endless, but sometimes—especially as a developer—you get the feeling that Apple doesn’t really need you, and will do just fine without you, thank you very much. I want Apple to need us.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Both great essays.</p>

								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="https://fiber.google.com/cities/austin/">Google Fiber is coming to Austin</a> next year, with crazy-fast 1 Gbps speeds. It was all over the local news in Austin yesterday.</p>
<p>Although I’ve been trying to slowly move off of Google services, this would probably be too good a deal to pass up. However, it seems very unlikely that my neighborhood — which is in the city limits, but pretty far away from central Austin — will get fiber anytime soon. Definitely not in the first year. From the <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/technology/got-questions-about-google-fiber-here-are-some-ans/nXHMk/">Statesman’s FAQ</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The coverage is limited to the city of Austin, although Google did not get specific about geographic boundaries. Representatives said they don’t have plans to add Round Rock, Kyle or San Antonio as part of this roll-out. In addition to homes, Google will also provide Gigabit to about 100 public organizations that the city of Austin has helped choose.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>We don’t even yet have Verizon FiOS in our neighborhood, and that has been rolling out in the Austin area for a while now. Time Warner Cable is still the dominant provider.</p>
<p>Another interesting angle to the announcement: each Google Fiber customer also gets 1 <em>terabyte</em> of Google Drive storage. This sounded like a fantastic deal until I checked the normal Google Drive plans. They already have a 1 TB plan at $50/month, with more expensive options all the way up to 16 TB. (Dropbox stops at 500 GB unless you jump to their business-level “teams” plan.)</p>
<p>Maybe that is the first killer app for fiber. Not syncing files, as Dropbox pioneered, but cloud storage that is fast enough to be more like an extension of your local hard drive than a mirror of it. Something like <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2012884/apple-unveils-fusion-drive-for-new-imac-and-mac-mini.html">Apple’s Fusion Drive</a>, but where the slow hard drive is the cloud, and the SSD is just a local cache.</p>

Which device you’re using could also have an impact on search results:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Search results could be weighted by the device you are using quite heavily. Just like how on iPhone you don’t see iPad-only apps when searching the app store; on iPhone 5 you should be very unlikely to see apps that only support 3.5-inch screens.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Makes sense to me. Also check out his comment at the end, that kids these days may have a very difficult time revisiting the classic apps from today, 20 years from now.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  “The Hotline system consists of three parts: servers, clients, and trackers. Anyone with an Internet connection can host a Hotline server for free; it’s software that provides for multi-user chat, message boards, and file transfers. Clients are special programs users run to connect to Hotline servers. And trackers are special servers that exist to facilitate connections between clients and servers; they keep an active list of available Hotline servers that wish to be listed on the tracker.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I remember Hotline. I was building web sites by then, but it still had obvious appeal reminiscent of the earlier BBS and AOL/eWorld days. This article from Macworld is important because it will serve as a sort of Hotline software “about page” for future internet searchers. For many apps that were popular in the 1990s, it’s now very difficult to find an online record that they even existed.</p>

			<p>I’m not going to comment specifically on the substance of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/">the SendGrid and PlayHaven mess</a> because it’s complicated and completely out of hand already. It’s a pretty sad situation for everyone.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, I am a SendGrid customer. I use the free plan to send email in a few of my web apps. I started using SendGrid because they offered it as a simple Heroku add-on, not because of any particular research or opinion about what they were doing well.</p>
<p>So it’s a good time to move away, to a company that I can pick based on merits and attitude and not just because it was the default choice. I’ve long been a <a href="http://www.beanstalkapp.com/">Beanstalk</a> customer; I use it for all my private Subversion and Git repositories. The makers of Beanstalk, Wildbit, have a second product similar to SendGrid that looks like what I need: <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://wildbit.com/blog/2013/03/22/a-gentlemans-agreement/">Wildbit also had a good blog post</a> yesterday from some of the aftermath of the controversy as it relates to SendGrid (and Postmark) competitors:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We’ve been doing this a long time, 13 years as a company, 8 years since launching our first product. There’s this rule, this gentleman’s agreement I thought existed. When someone you compete against is suffering, especially as a result of any kind of infrastructure issues, shut up and keep your head down. You do not use this situation to gain a few customers eager to jump ship.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I like what I see in Postmark. I’ve set up an account and should have my apps switched over to Postmark this weekend.</p>

  “Maybe it’s just the headache I’ve had since the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6GRFKWGn1k">Samsung Galaxy 4 event</a> or the fact that <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/why-iphone/">Apple’s turning up the heat</a>, but I find the increasingly defensive views held in the technology community increasingly offensive.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I got into the Mac in the 1990s during the lead-up to Apple’s certain doom, so I spent quite a lot of time arguing with Windows users. The problem with the new version of that debate, Apple vs. Samsung and the smartphone wars, is that <em>I’m not sure it’s ever going to end</em>. There are good phones on either side, the pundits can’t wait for Apple to fail but Apple is strong, and there’s no hope to escape the noise for those of us who just want to build some apps.</p>

			<p>David Smith on <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2013/03/21/purging-the-back-catalog/">cleaning up the App Store</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The App Store currently has around <a href="http://148apps.biz/app-store-metrics/?mpage=appcount">800k</a> active apps listed. I suspect a significant number of these haven’t been updated in more than 12 months. An app that is listed for sale but is no longer under active development creates the possibility for bad user experience. It is like a grocery store that leaves expired produce on its shelves.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He makes a good argument for removing old apps from the store, but I’d probably hesitate going all the way to actively take them out. There is certainly too much clutter in the App Store — too many apps that aren’t providing much value, some with little chance of an update. But I also dislike the already fragile state of App Store inventory. iOS apps require much more active maintenance than traditional, direct download Mac apps, which can be hosted anywhere and stay available without constant attention from the developer.</p>
<p>At one point <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/newdisruptors/14/">on episode 14 of The New Disruptors podcast</a>, Glenn Fleishman talked with John Gruber about apps as a unique art form unlike paintings or novels or even film because apps are never done. John Gruber from that show, talking about software:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “To me it is an art form. But it is the one thing that is continuously diddled with. You write a novel and it’s done, it’s out there. Once it’s published, it’s published. You make a movie, it’s done. George Lucas gets a lot of flak because he keeps revisiting his old Star Wars movies and making a change here and there, but it’s not like every year he comes out with a new version of Star Wars. […] But software — an app that has a vibrant and still-growing user base — it’s the same thing, constantly being iterated. It’s the only art form that is like that.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are always bugs, always missing features, and always (as is David’s point above) new hardware to adapt to. It’s an art form that won’t stay still, so maybe there is an inherent impermanence to it.</p>
<p>But if apps are an art form, an important part of our culture, then it shouldn’t require so much work to make sure they don’t disappear forever, so quickly. This happened to me just this week, actually. I forgot to renew my iOS developer program account and my apps were automatically removed from sale for a few hours while I scrambled to pay my $99 again.</p>
<p>Maybe there’s a compromise solution in here somewhere. Instead of being removed from sale, abandoned apps could switch to an archived state. They would no longer show up in top lists or even search, but could still be found with a direct link. With the right kind of fallback like that, Apple could be even more aggressive about gearing the App Store user experience around new apps and modern devices, without sacrificing what is good about the long tail of old apps.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>John Gruber has a series of posts questioning Apple’s judgement in hiring Kevin Lynch. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/19/exhibit-b">This one best sums it up</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I get that the guy worked for Adobe and had to play for the home team, but as CTO he backed a dying technology for years too long. In 2007 when the iPhone shipped Flash-free, that was one thing. But for Adobe to still be backing the Flash horse in 2010 when the iPad came out — they just looked silly.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>All of that is true. But instead of reflecting poor judgement, I think Kevin Lynch joining Apple could be good news in what it says about Apple. They didn’t hire him blindly. Apple knows what Kevin has been working on, knows what he’s said in public, and at this moment probably knows much better than we do what it was like to be at Adobe those last few years. For all we know Apple cares more about his work on Creative Cloud than Flash.</p>
<p><a href="http://klynch.com/">Kevin also has a rich history</a> that is closely tied with the Mac. He worked as a developer on FrameMaker. He worked at General Magic alongside old-school Apple engineers. He worked at Macromedia when they started building web tools.</p>
<p>I heard him speak much later at SXSW in 2002, for a joint presentation he gave with Jeffrey Veen. At the time I disagreed with Kevin’s vision for Flash and the web, but the SXSW talk was interesting enough that I <a href="http://manton.org/2003/03/flash_vs_web_apps.html">referenced it afterwards</a> and again <a href="http://manton.org/2004/03/sxsw_day_1_web.html">later</a>. Kevin was so good that he somehow demonstrated he got the web even as he pitched a product that was increasingly at odds with it.</p>
<p>Was he wrong about Flash? Yes. But I choose to view his move to Apple as an indication that he was at the wrong company more than that he was completely wrong-headed. Maybe it was time for something new, a course correction back to the earlier part of his career. Skepticism about this hire is fine, but to treat him as an outsider is to forget the other great things he’s worked on. Once you’ve built Mac software, no matter how long ago, you’ll always be one of us.</p>
<p>I hope Apple sees it that way too. Because if Apple is confident of anything, it’s that they can’t get stuck in one old way of thinking, can’t discount good people because of one unforgivable bad idea. That Apple is able to brush aside the Flash debate as yesterday’s news — even accept as a VP someone who was at the heart of that debate, and on the wrong side — shows to me that they’re only looking forward.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://rightapp.tumblr.com/post/40671466986/the-etiquette-of-app-net">Phillip Gruneich has an interesting post</a> about what’s different about ADN, with thoughts on the global feed and link posting:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “App.net is a different environment and it must be preserved that way. If you get into it and decide to behave like it is a Twitter alternative, then the differences will fade away and we’ll lose a precious experience.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are some ideas in here that surprised me. For example, I’m not sure I agree that everyone reads the global feed, nor that people should be discouraged from linking to anything but their own work. I love to post links to products from friends and companies that are doing interesting things.</p>
<p>Even if it isn’t as busy as on Twitter — Twitter disabled their global feed years ago when it started moving too fast to be read — it would still be difficult to do anything more than occasionally skim the global feed on ADN.</p>
<p>He does hit on something important, though. Because it’s a paid service, and there’s a cost to additional accounts, most of the users are actual people. There are fewer companies and parody accounts. (But I did end up getting <a href="https://alpha.app.net/riverfold">@riverfold on ADN</a>, which I felt was a nice compromise when compared against my 4-5 app accounts on Twitter.)</p>
<p>So I might not use ADN in exactly the same way that Phillip does, but the hope that ADN remains unique is the same because it’s something nearly everyone on ADN probably hopes for. And that’s the really good news: if what makes ADN special is the people, then it’s because all of the people have something in common. They didn’t chose ADN by accident, or because it was the default choice. They chose it because <em>they wanted something better</em>.</p>
<p>In the short 5 months since <a href="../../../2012/08/appnets_great.html">I wrote about ADN’s start</a>, I’ve become a big fan of the founders, the quality of the API and developer program, and the general tone of ADN users. There might not be a single best way to use ADN, and that will become even more true over time as the scope of the API grows. But there’s no question that it is a special service that deserves to be a peer with Twitter and Facebook in terms of new apps and conversations, even as it exists in a different world where huge “1 billion user” scale doesn’t matter.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Over three months ago I stopped using Twitter. I wanted to make a statement — perhaps in an overly-dramatic way — that the developer-hostile environment that Twitter had evolved into wasn’t something I could support anymore. I do still read plenty of tweets while testing <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>, and I’m almost done with a new version of <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>, because my customers deserve great Twitter features. But I haven’t tweeted, retweeted, or favorited a thing from my personal account since October 5th.</p>
<p>I knew that sometimes it would be difficult to resist going back to Twitter, replying to a question, or cross-posting my posts from App.net. So I set things up to discourage my future self from even considering more tweeting. I picked the 1-year anniversary of the day Steve Jobs died and <a href="http://watermark.io/collections/manton/myfinaltweets">wrote my final tweets</a> a week in advance. If someone visits my profile, I want those statements to be what they see. I can’t tweet again without pushing those tweets from the top of the list.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, App.net started taking off. Netbot shipped. The <a href="http://blog.app.net/2012/09/27/announcing-the-app-net-developer-incentive-program/">developer incentive program</a> started to directly reward developers. There’s a good community there. It’s smaller than on Twitter; there isn’t the same never-ending stream of tweets flowing into your timeline. But maybe that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>The flip side is that it’s hard to let go of things like Twitter that have value. I had similar self-doubt when I killed off my app Wii Transfer, so that I could focus on bigger ideas. But simplifying has allowed me to do some of the best work of my career in 2012. I’ve put everything I have into Watermark, into the new Tweet Marker subscriptions, into doing Core Intuition weekly, into <a href="../../../2012/06/ship_everything.html">shipping everything I work on</a>. 2013 is going to be awesome, and I’m not looking back.</p>
