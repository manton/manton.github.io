			<p>He snuck it in under a commentary on Alex Payne&#8217;s excellent &#8220;last post about Twitter&#8221;:http://al3x.net/2010/09/15/last-thing-about-twitter.html, but we now have a &#8220;Birdfeed postmortem of sorts from Buzz Andersen&#8221;:http://log.scifihifi.com/post/1144913920/in-a-way-the-twitter-platform-has-come-full. I&#8217;m particularly interested in where Buzz thinks the Twitter app market is going:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Does this mean that there&#8217;s no longer room for third party Twitter clients? My suspicion is that people will continue to make them, but it seems to me that they&#8217;re already on the road to becoming increasingly uniform and commoditized as the Twitter experience is more sharply defined by Twitter itself (as my Birdfeed collaborator Neven Mrgan has suggested to me, Twitter clients are going the way of email clients).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems nearly everyone thinks competing with Twitter&#8217;s official app is a bad idea. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Tapbots revealing Tweetbot&#8221;:http://tapbots.com/blog/business/say-hello-to-tweetbot shortly after the Tweetie acquisition:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But this news changes things for us. We probably won&#8217;t be able to charge for the app anymore. Who&#8217;s going to pay for a Twitter client when &#8216;Tweetie&#8217; is free?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the problem isn&#8217;t trying to build any Twitter app. The problem is building a <em>mainstream Twitter client</em>. The official iPhone and iPad apps, plus the redesigned web site, are so good that it&#8217;s futile to go head to head with them. You can&#8217;t undercut on price, and they are so well coded you&#8217;d need a talented full-time team to out-engineer them.</p>
<p>As I said in &#8220;my last Twitter post&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/09/next_generation.html, the trick is to look past the API. What would I want Twitter to add to the platform if I had my way? Design an app around that and you might have something interesting.</p>
<p>The theme in Buzz&#8217;s post that resonated the strongest with me is the emotional drain that building an app like this can have. The competition is intense. There&#8217;s a feeling that if you don&#8217;t have every little feature when you ship, you&#8217;ll be laughed out of the App Store. That is certainly on my mind, especially as &#8220;I intend to push the price&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/06/10_ipad_apps.html in this market, and even with beta feedback I&#8217;m still not sure how my app is going to be received in the real world.</p>

			<p>I feel bad admitting it, because some of my friends are betting on iAd revenue to feed their family, but I&#8217;m just not on board with Apple running an advertising network. I don&#8217;t want to see ads in my apps, and I don&#8217;t want Apple to ever lose even a little of what it means to be a product-driven company.</p>
<p>We talk about this on Core Intuition. Nearly every chance I get I like to point out that all these free Google apps come at a cost. <a href="http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/1317967543">Take this tweet</a> from last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Google Voice is so awesome but I just think it&#8217;s dangerous to give Google this much power. Slippery slope, folks. You are not a customer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.metafilter.com/95152/Userdriven-discontent#3256046">And this comment</a> on MetaFilter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you are not paying for it, you&#8217;re not the customer; you&#8217;re the product being sold.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some apps should absolutely be ad-suported (such as a search engine or social network), and many can be freemium (free versions supported by higher-priced subscriptions), but when given a choice I&#8217;d rather pay a fair price for a good service. When your customers are not your users, the product will suffer.</p>
<p>I know the world is full of ads already. We&#8217;re used to it &mdash; numb to it, maybe. But think about what the App Store has done: millions of people are paying real money for apps that complement ad-supported web sites. These same people would never pay a subscription fee to use the web site, but they&#8217;ll pay a few bucks for the same features in an iPhone app <em>and it seems perfectly normal</em>.</p>
<p>Do we really want to give that marketplace up? Because once it&#8217;s gone, and iAds are the norm, it will be an uphill battle to get anyone to pay for anything.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mike Rohde racked up $190 in iTunes in-app purchases&#8221;:http://www.rohdesign.com/weblog/archives/003193.html without knowing it, blaming an app called &#8220;Fishies&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fishies-by-playmesh/id360868737?mt=8 by PlayMesh for tricking his son into purchasing virtual items without a password prompt. He was obviously pretty upset &mdash; I would be too! &mdash; but calling it a &#8220;scam&#8221; probably goes too far. So what really happened?</p>
<p>It is fairly well known that after the App Store prompts for your iTunes password, you can download more apps for a certain length of time (at least a few minutes) before it requires a password again. What seemed less clear is that this applies to in-app purchases as well.</p>
<p>To be sure, I ran a test to confirm the behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download a new free app from the App Store (I downloaded the current number 1 iPhone app, Farm Story Summer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter your password to confirm the download.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as it finishes, go to another completely different app (in my case it was Iconfactory&#8217;s Ramp Champ, which I had downloaded months ago).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchase an in-app virtual item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It prompts for whether you want to buy the item (the standard Apple prompt), but <em>without requiring a password</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What must have happened to Mike is that he bought something, entered his password, and then handed the iPad over to his son. His son played the fish game and clicked a bunch of random stuff (likely got the Buy prompt), but because the whole concept of virtual currency is kind of confusing, and because it didn&#8217;t ask for a password, the app happily let him make all the purchases.</p>
<p>I doubt the developer of this app did anything wrong. A reasonable argument could be made that iTunes should either not cache passwords at all, or keep a separate cache for app downloads vs. in-app purchases, or maybe always prompt for a password on in-app purchases. My kids and other kids I know have also used this backdoor trick to sneak a couple app downloads, but usually it&#8217;s a few bucks, not $190. Consumable virtual items (that you can keep buying over and over) make this problem much worse.</p>
<p>On &#8220;episode 60 of This Week In Startups&#8221;:http://thisweekin.com/thisweekin-startups/this-week-in-startups-60-with-neil-young/, Jason Calacanis interviewed ngmoco founder Neil Young about the mobile game business, focusing on the hit iPhone/iPad game &#8220;We Rule&#8221;:http://werule.ngmoco.com/. I was stunned to learn from the show that some individuals spend not only hundreds of dollars but up to $10,000 on in-app purchases in We Rule. Neil Young was happy to take their money, but something feels wrong here, like a gambling addiction gotten way out of hand. Or maybe just kids running up their dad&#8217;s credit card bill.</p>

			<p>Alright, it&#8217;s been 2 weeks. How does the iPhone 4 hold up?</p>
<p>For me, there was less urgency to this launch then for previous iPhone releases. I wanted the 3GS on day one (video recording!) and of course I waited all afternoon for the original iPhone (shiny!). Likewise I couldn&#8217;t wait for the iPad. This time I viewed iMovie and FaceTime as the killer apps. Sign me up!</p>
<p>But I wasn&#8217;t willing to wait all day. I tried the same approach that had worked great for the iPad: show up late in the day after the madness has settled down. No luck this time. I waited about half an hour, then came back before closing and waited a couple more hours to get a voucher for the next day. Total wait time about 3.5 hours over 2 days and 3 visits.</p>
<p>To get it on day 1, most people waited 6 hours. I&#8217;m sure &#8220;John Gruber&#8217;s story on Flickr&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/4731689070/in/contacts/ was common too.</p>
<p>This was Apple&#8217;s most poorly-managed launch I&#8217;ve been to. The 3GS line was pretty fast. For iPad it was extremely quick &mdash; in and out in half an hour. I mostly blame the extra step of requiring activation in-store, but there were enough problems that I think this whole thing was mismanaged somewhere.</p>
<p>Some of the inconsistent messages I heard depending on which Apple Store employee I talked to:</p>
<ul>
<li>AT&amp;T activation is not the bottleneck / yes it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are selling 30 phones every 10 minutes / no idea how long the wait is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&#8217;ll shut down the line at 7pm and give out vouchers / staying open until 2am.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vouchers will allow you to skip everyone else in line the next day / you&#8217;re guaranteed a phone but have to wait in line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also &#8220;collected a few tweets about the launch&#8221;:http://tweetlib.com/manton/iphone4.</p>
<p>Anyway, the phone. It&#8217;s the best phone I&#8217;ve ever seen. No question.</p>
<p>Now that some time has passed, I think I can comment on the reception issue. It&#8217;s real. Outside my house, I don&#8217;t notice it. But my street is a notoriously bad dead zone, and while I don&#8217;t get any more dropped calls than I used to, I can no longer hold the phone in the palm of my left hand when using mobile Safari. It&#8217;s pretty frustrating because I&#8217;ve been holding the phone this way for 3 years. It&#8217;s awkward to break the habit.</p>
<p>Having said that, I&#8217;ll close with the same thing I told strangers who came up asking about the phone. It&#8217;s easy to overlook the reception issue because of how great the rest of the phone is, and all existing iPhone users will love the iPhone 4. Eventually I&#8217;ll just cave in and buy a bumper.</p>

			<p>It appears I was too optimistic &#8220;in my last post&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/03/24hour_review_times.html about the App Store getting better.</p>
<p>The iPhone version of Snowtape, in development for months, &#8220;was rejected&#8221;:http://www.vemedio.com/blog/posts/134 because it could let users record and share audio from the internet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;His sole words were, that there are lots of things missing in the SDK agreement and that they can not foresee any circumstance that leads to a denial of an app. That&#8217;s right! We did not violate any paragraph of the SDK, yet they forbid us distributing our app.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The developer removed the ability to transfer audio files off the phone and then Apple let the app through.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s this post &#8220;on the developer forums&#8221;:https://devforums.apple.com/message/190892 about an iPad app rejection because they recreated a UI innovation from the new Photos app. Apple said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The application uses a tap and a pinch to expand feature that is present in Apple iPad Applications. This action is associated solely with Apple applications, and we kindly ask that you update your app appropriately.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a bunch of iPhone and iPad development this week. The more I work with it, the more I love the platform. But it just takes a couple rejections to sour the whole experience.</p>
<p>And yes, I realize I&#8217;m posting this on one of the most exciting days in the history of the App Store. The first round of iPad apps hitting the store today look fantastic.</p>

			<p>&#8220;At VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ we now have a dozen Xserves running Ruby on Rails and a couple others running MySQL. While it&#8217;s mostly stable now, over the years there have been several mystery show-stopper problems that no one seems to have on other platforms.</p>
<p>Which is why I found this &#8220;quote from Rentzsch&#8221;:http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/316835872/mac-os-x-server-a-fear-realized so interesting:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The trick is to radically minimize all services performed by Mac OS X Server itself, and instead run services in VMware-hosted Debian images. At that point, Mac OS X Server becomes little more than a simple container for VMware, something it seems able to handle with a minimum of tantrums.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems kind of wasteful, but Mac OS X Server really is overkill most of the time.</p>
<p>Related: over the weekend I checked into &#8220;Heroku&#8221;:http://www.heroku.com/. I&#8217;m impressed with what they have built. If it works as advertised, I think I&#8217;ll supplement my Dreamhost stuff with Heroku any time I need a Ruby backend.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I noticed a couple tweets last month about fast, less than 24-hour review times for iPhone app submissions. After I tweeted it, a whole bunch of other people came forward with similar stories. Apps going from submission to ready-for-sale in 12 to 24 hours.</p>
<p>The App Store is still fundamentally broken in many ways, possibly beyond repair depending on who you talk to, but there&#8217;s no question that fast review times are great for developers. Even if the progress stops with this, it&#8217;s a significant improvement to the App Store process.</p>
<p>Is it just for established devs? Just for minor bug fixes? It&#8217;s not the latter, since some of these were brand new apps. The question is whether this was a change for a certain class of developers and apps or whether it represents an overall speed-up to the review process, and maybe even a hint at prepping for the iPad launch.</p>
<p>Review times are a big deal and they&#8217;ve gone mainstream. Opera Mini has a very public &#8220;count up&#8221;:http://my.opera.com/community/countup/ widget as part of their extensive pre-approval hype. You can tell from the demos that Opera put a huge amount of work into polishing Mini before submitting it, to remove as many potential objections as possible, and to get users excited before it ships. A high-profile rejection now would erase any goodwill that Apple has built up recently.</p>
<p>I know some developers are nervous with openly discussing or blogging about their relationship with Apple, but I think more people should follow Opera&#8217;s lead. By being vocal on the App Store&#8217;s strengths and shortcomings, we force Apple to be more transparent. Bad press has a proven history of leading to overturned rejections. The narrative of the last few months, to me, is that the App Store is getting better, and I don&#8217;t think it would be happening without the critics.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Wil Shipley on Apple&#8217;s decision&#8221;:http://wilshipley.com/blog/2010/03/open-letter-to-steve-jobs-concerning.html to be aggressive on their iPhone patents:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But when you sue someone for doing something you do yourself, you become one of the bad guys. Can you name a company _you_ admire that spends its time enforcing patents, instead of innovating? Remember the pirate flag you flew over Apple&#8217;s headquarters when you were building the Mac?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And &#8220;my tweet on this&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/status/9886138112 from yesterday:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This iPhone preemptive patent war is going to backfire. You&#8217;re losing the battle for our hearts and minds, Apple.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether Apple wins this patent lawsuit or not doesn&#8217;t even matter; the old Apple many of us fell in love with is dead and maybe never coming back. I still want to think of Apple as the company that fights the good fight, innovating and putting user experience first. But you have the App Store exclusivity and rejections, and now you have the patents.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a shame they&#8217;ve gone so far off course. Regardless of market share and billions in revenue, I&#8217;ll always hold Apple to a higher standard than every other mega corp, and hope not just for better products but also for leadership and doing what&#8217;s right.</p>

<p>Will there be a &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ for iPad? I hope so. This platform will be the future for plenty of customers. Apple lived up to the hype not because of the hardware or distribution or anything entirely revolutionary, but because of the software. Splitviews and popovers. Keynote and Pages. These apps are just as competent as their desktop versions.</p>

			<p><em>I wrote the following before the iPad was announced. The world may have changed since then, but I&#8217;m posting it anyway. Enjoy.</em></p>
<p>I like the content but not the title in &#8220;John Casasanta&#8217;s blog post about the so-called death of Mac software&#8221;:http://www.taptaptap.com/blog/iphone-software-sustainability-and-the-death-of-mac-software/. He shares some great stats and lays out the case for why iPhone development is more appealing and successful for him, but that doesn&#8217;t make the Mac dead. What he really meant and says later is that it&#8217;s <em>dead to him</em>.</p>
<p>For those of us who love writing Mac software and who don&#8217;t feel the pull of get-rich-quick blockbuster apps, the Mac is alive and remains just as healthy as it was before the iPhone was announced.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what I want to write about, though. The real question is <em>how do we learn from the App Store and expand the market for Mac software</em>. Compared to the iPhone, the Mac has a fragmented application discovery and an inconsistent purchasing experience.</p>
<p>When Keith Alperin and Rick Fillion &#8220;talked on the MDN Show&#8221;:http://www.mac-developer-network.com/shows/podcasts/mdnshow/mdn017/ about a possible Mac app store, Rick revealed some interesting numbers from &#8220;Bodega&#8217;s&#8221;:http://appbodega.com/ installed base: 80,000 downloads and 10,000 active users. They&#8217;re not 1.0, and I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with these numbers, but it&#8217;s not big enough yet to make an iPhone-like impact on how we buy Mac software.</p>
<p>What Bodega does have is a technology head start. &#8220;My products&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ have been listed there since launch, and they have a polished application and feature-rich backend for tracking releases and collecting usage metrics. The key is solving the chicken-and-egg problem of getting the Bodega app in everyone&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>There are two approaches: either get people excited about installing Bodega because it&#8217;s useful for updating existing apps (which it is), or sneak a copy of Bodega on to many more Macs (which is what this post is about). This solution isn&#8217;t perfect, but short of Apple building a real Mac App Store or a marketing giant like MacHeist getting involved, it&#8217;s the only idea I can see working.</p>
<p>First, start with &#8220;PotionStorefront&#8221;:http://github.com/potionfactory/potionstorefront. There are a few of these in-app purchase frameworks out there, but I like the &#8220;Potion Factory&#8217;s aesthetic&#8221;:http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/ and Potion Store is popular. The web service used to submit orders could be supported by other custom store backends, including Bodega&#8217;s own purchasing system when they have it.</p>
<p>On top of this in-app purchase foundation, you bundle a subset of the Bodega application discovery UI directly into the framework. Users can download and install demo versions of new apps without leaving the catalog. Think of it as a &#8220;lite&#8221; version of Bodega, streamlined to fit inside everyone&#8217;s app. You also include the full Bodega application so that it can be launched and optionally installed in the user&#8217;s applications folder.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;ve effectively done here is give everyone who buys a third-party app access to a new store where they can discover other apps. It&#8217;s compelling for developers because the more companies that participate, the wider their reach becomes. And it&#8217;s great for users because over time it starts to create a consistent user experience, and familiarity reduces the effort in buying Mac software.</p>
<p>Some tricky issues remain, though. You don&#8217;t want to distract users from buying their first application, or muddle that app&#8217;s branding, and you want to later encourage users to find or be notified about new applications without it looking like an advertisement. The challenge is in finding a balance that most developers would want to use.</p>
<p>Back to the iPhone&#8217;s success, from a post by &#8220;Guy English&#8221;:http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/67:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People, lots and lots of people, people who have no idea what software even is, will download Apps like they&#8217;re snacking on potatoe chips. What&#8217;s my proof? Well, two million downloads of an App in a week supports that and I&#8217;d argue that a total of three billion Apps downloaded backs up my argument too.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve never seen anything like it, and I&#8217;m really happy for my friends who have had success on the iPhone. Luckily, the iPhone and Mac don&#8217;t actually compete. The App Store can sell ten thousand times the amount of software as the Mac does and it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that Mac users need software too. It&#8217;s our job as developers to continue to provide solutions for users and help those users find us.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Clipstart 1.2.4 is done! It&#8217;s a minor bug fix update but includes dozens of small improvements (and some not so small, if you&#8217;re measuring not with new UI but in number of lines of code changed). I&#8217;m very happy with this release and excited to move on to some other new features in the works for 1.3 and beyond. &#8220;Download and more info&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/.</p>
<p>And because I don&#8217;t have anything else of substance related to Clipstart to talk about yet, I&#8217;ll leave you with &#8220;this Buzz Andersen quote&#8221;:http://log.scifihifi.com/post/159881723/the-twitter-app-to-use-on-android-im-told-is about quality:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Shipping quality is a longer, tougher road than just shipping whatever to be first to market, and its benefits tend to be realized more slowly, but if you want users to love your software as a brand, and not merely use it as a commodity, it&#8217;s the only way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to link to this since it was posted earlier in the year. &#8220;Jens Alfke hopes&#8221;:http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2009/02/what-will-web-30-be/ for a decentralized future Web 3.0:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Centralization creates concentrations of power, and that&#8217;s dangerous. The people who run the servers have total control over your (and everyone&#8217;s) data. They can snoop at it (however private it&#8217;s supposed to be), they can sell it to advertisers, they can accidentally lose it, they can accidentally expose it to hackers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. Even for the best-loved centralized companies, like Twitter and Flickr, I want a copy of my data. If the first set of desktop tools to interface with web services were all about sharing and publishing, the next software generation will need to also effortlessly download and backup that data. Even usually careful programmers &#8220;sometimes get it wrong&#8221;:http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=990323.</p>
<p>Jens goes on to talk about CouchDB, including a link to &#8220;this intro book&#8221;:http://books.couchdb.org/relax/. Looks good. Couch and &#8220;other no-SQL database systems&#8221;:http://nosql-database.org/ like Mongo are interesting technologies that I&#8217;d probably come up with an excuse to use if MySQL wasn&#8217;t such a workhorse already.

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I let my iPhone developer account expire last week. Even though I had already stopped development on my iPhone projects, officially letting go of even the temptation to build for the iPhone platform has really helped me focus.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Rogue Amoeba rejection for Airfoil Speakers Touch&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2009/11/13/airfoil-speakers-touch-1-0-1-finally-ships/ has been covered on Twitter and &#8220;at Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2009/11/airfoil_touch_situation, but I think it&#8217;s easy to get distracted by legal technicalities and not the heart of the matter: as long as Apple is the gatekeeper, there will be bad decisions and apps that deserve to be approved will be rejected instead. For this reason the App Store cannot be fixed with incremental improvements.</p>
<p>There are only two possible solutions:</p>
<h1>Accept all applications. Joe Hewitt, the developer of the Facebook application who this week also quit the App Store, &#8220;has written well on this solution&#8221;:http://joehewitt.com/post/innocent-until-proven-guilty/.</h1>
<h1>Allow applications to be installed on the phone without being listed in the App Store. Both Android and the Palm Pre &#8220;support this model&#8221;:http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/05/palm-free-apps-for-the-web-free-development-for-open-source-and-free-pres/.</h1>
<p>There is no third or fourth solution. There is no compromise or small improvement to the review process. Better transparency or tiered support options won&#8217;t help either. Without either of the above two changes, rejections will continue because in a subjective review process there will always be bad judgement calls. Some percentage of indie developers will abandon the iPhone either because the risk is too great or based on principle alone.</p>
<p>Let me take the second one (allow applications to be installed without being listed) because it plays directly to this Rogue Amoeba rejection. Rogue Amoeba is one of my favorite Mac companies, and Daniel Jalkut and I record &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ using their Audio Hijack Pro app. It&#8217;s universally regarded as great software.</p>
<p>It might surprise you to find out that Audio Hijack Pro is not listed in the &#8220;Apple Downloads&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/ site, though other Rogue Amoeba products such as Fission, Nicecast, and Airfoil are. I&#8217;m not sure Rogue Amoeba has ever spoken on the record about this, but Apple apparently doesn&#8217;t like the app and won&#8217;t list it. Maybe because you can use it to record copyrighted music? Who knows.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t matter because being rejected from Apple Downloads doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t make Mac software! It just means you have to market the software yourself. Rogue Amoeba has to work extra hard to get the word out about the app, but their business won&#8217;t fail just because Apple doesn&#8217;t give it their blessing.</p>
<p>This is so important for a small company. I want my software to fail because it sucks, or is buggy, or doesn&#8217;t have the right features, not because Apple can shut me down over a minor difference of opinion.</p>
<p>There are a lot of well-intentioned suggestions for improving the App Store, but the result will always be the same until we acknowledge the root problem. The only fix is for Apple to remove itself as gatekeeper, or let us route around them.</p>

			<p>I talked in &#8220;Core Intuition episode 22&#8243;:http://www.coreint.org/2009/08/episode-22-not-just-a-hobby/ about how I&#8217;ve stopped working on my indie iPhone apps. Mike Ash is also done with it. &#8220;He writes&#8221;:http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/the-iphone-development-story-one-year-later.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have abandoned the platform. Apple&#8217;s nonsense is just too much for me. There&#8217;s no joy in iPhone development, and an enormous amount of frustration.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading through the comments got me thinking. I&#8217;m not abandoning the iPhone just because the App Store is such a frustrating environment to run a business in, or that I have a bunch of real work I could be doing instead of playing games with Apple. It&#8217;s also because most of the apps I would write have already been done, and in some cases done very well.</p>
<p>I love having a small computer in my pocket and mine is full of third-party apps. I&#8217;m thankful for the developers who are coming from other platforms and focusing all of their attention on the phone. And they are thrilled to be an a platform that is such a step up from traditional mobile development. The financial success stories of developers hitting on a great idea and it just taking off in the App Store are real and inspiring.</p>
<p>But the iPhone doesn&#8217;t need me.</p>
<p>As a user there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;ll give up the phone, but as a developer I can focus my time on &#8220;things that I have control over&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/, and add value to places where no one else has a good solution. Perceived gold rush or not, stretching myself too thin with both iPhone and Mac development is a great way to fail at both.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment that &#8220;Yellow Box for Windows&#8221;:http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?YellowBox wasn&#8217;t killed off &mdash; that we could build Windows apps using Cocoa. Should I make my apps cross-platform just because it&#8217;s Objective-C? No. Writing software for a platform I don&#8217;t use would be like still supporting Mac OS X 10.2; there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to boot into that thing to test and fix my app.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Mac developer, my message to you is the same: just because the iPhone is awesome and runs on Objective-C <em>does not mean you are required to build software for it</em>. Maybe your time would be better spent refining old apps or building new ones on the Mac. Maybe&#8230; the iPhone doesn&#8217;t need you, either.</p>

			<p>I mentioned on the &#8220;latest Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2009/08/episode-22-not-just-a-hobby/ that I no longer have any plans to release my own iPhone software. While that decision is mostly based on my unwillingness to give Apple so much control over my business, and frustrations with the App Store process in particular, there are a handful of technical reasons why iPhone development is not a good fit for me. Here&#8217;s one: open source.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel Jalkut&#8217;s essay on the GPL&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/825/getting-pretty-lonely hits all the points about how the GPL can hurt developers by discouraging commercial participation. I&#8217;ve used LGPL projects in both &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ and &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/, and I am careful to use them correctly. But iPhone development presents an interesting problem.</p>
<p><em>Can&#8217;t run command line tools.</em> Separating the GPL code into a command line tool that is inside your application bundle is a common way to get around licensing issues. This is not allowed in the iPhone SDK.</p>
<p><em>Can&#8217;t replace dynamic libraries.</em> The LGPL says that you can also link to libraries at runtime, but the catch is that the user must be able to replace an LGPL library with a newer version of their choosing. There is no way for normal users to do this on the iPhone.</p>
<p><em>Can&#8217;t use private frameworks.</em> Oh, that point above about dynamic libraries? Actually it&#8217;s a moot point because Apple requires everything to be statically linked anyway. So you are blocked at every pass; you can&#8217;t ship an app that loads code dynamically even if the user could touch it.</p>
<p>The only solution I&#8217;ve seen so far is to release a special version of your Xcode project, with most of your application split into compiled libraries instead of source code, and allow developers with the iPhone SDK to relink your application with a different copy of whatever LGPL code you used. I stopped researching this when I put my own iPhone projects on hold, though. It&#8217;s just another example of how the closed nature of the platform creates an unnecessary burden in the software development process.</p>

			<p>I get a lot of funny looks when I tell people I host everything on Dreamhost. It&#8217;s not a great fit for everything &mdash; I have some ideas for projects that would be better suited to Amazon EC2, and who knows, maybe I&#8217;ve just been on a lucky server &mdash; but it has generally been more reliable than any previous hosting company I&#8217;ve used, including when I used to run my own server.</p>
<p>Dreamhost succeeds because of scale. They have so many servers, and such low prices, that they are forced to automate everything. This means they can more quickly deploy new software, rebuild servers, or restore a broken installation, and that their panel interface has to provide access to every feature a customer might want.</p>
<p>&#8220;This post from their status blog&#8221;:http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2009/07/18/network-problems-due-to-distribution-switch/ is revealing. There are over 600 machines on that list, but it must be only some fraction of their customer base, because my server name isn&#8217;t on there. &#8220;According to WebHosting.Info&#8221;:http://www.webhosting.info/webhosts/reports/total_domains/DREAMHOST.COM, Dreamhost hosts about 875,000 domains.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that &#8220;being small is a competitive advantage&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/customer.html, but anyone who&#8217;s played the role of sys admin knows that automation means everything, and that&#8217;s what Dreamhost seems to get right.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;Huge post from Craig Hockenberry&#8221;:http://furbo.org/2009/07/10/year-two/ on the App Store. Lots of good points. I especially like the insight comparing it to the music store, the need for upgrade revenue, and ideas for improving discoverability.</p>
<p>Where I have a problem is at the $999.</p>
<p>Not for support or early access to new versions of the iPhone OS, that&#8217;s fine. ADC Select and Premier members are used to paying for non-essential bonuses. The issue is whether we should pay extra to work around a problem that Apple has created for themselves and developers.</p>
<p>And I totally respect that Craig is just throwing out a bunch of possible solutions, hoping that something will stick, that Apple will start to pay attention and draw inspiration from the community. &#8220;As he said on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/chockenberry/status/2577781479: &#8220;I just want to put money where my mouth is.&#8221; I think the $999 figure speaks to just how painful this process has become. Luckily developers are also natural problem-solvers, forever hopeful even when desperate.</p>
<p>But just as the $99 fee to become an iPhone developer didn&#8217;t filter out the junk apps and unserious developers new to the platform, neither will throwing more money at the problem make it go away. The gold rush is still on, and we should expect app submissions to only accelerate.</p>
<p>Most importantly, let&#8217;s take a step back and remember: <em>it was Apple&#8217;s choice to build a closed system, one in which they alone could approve and deny apps</em>. The idea that we should pay extra because they underestimated how much work it would be to approve thousands of apps really bothers me. It would be punishing developers for Apple&#8217;s own failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colin Barrett pointed out&#8221;:http://twitter.com/cbarrett/status/2576856894 that Apple loses money on free apps, when you consider server overhead and review staff. I find it difficult to believe that Apple is doing anything except raking in the cash from the App Store. After all, they are used to giving away bandwidth for a number of products: Safari and QuickTime downloads, iLife and iWork software updates, not to mention updates to Mac OS X itself.</p>
<p>From an article back in May, &#8220;Techcrunch also assumes&#8221;:http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/14/about-those-iphone-app-store-numbers/ that Apple is doing quite well off the App Store:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;$1 million a day means that Apple would be making $300,000 a day (its 30% cut). Extrapolated out over 10 months (the approximate age of the App Store), that would be about $90 million.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to believe that there is a solution to this. A quick reading of &#8220;AppShopper.com&#8221;:http://www.appshopper.com/ shows that on some days up to 100-200 apps go live on the store. That&#8217;s a lot of apps. But Apple is a large company, and they&#8217;ve surely dealt with more difficult staffing problems than <em>hiring some people who know how to use an iPhone</em>.</p>
<p>Other than a handful of exceptions in the jailbreak community, iPhone developers are playing by the rules Apple created. The burden is on Apple to deliver fast reviews, and it&#8217;s something that all developers deserve, not just a select few with extra cash to burn.</p>

			<p>There&#8217;s always the risk when developing for Mac OS X that Apple will compete directly with your product. iTunes, Mail, and Safari are high-profile examples, as well as the &#8220;lightning strikes twice&#8221; hit of Watson/Sherlock and Sandvox/iWeb. That history is &#8220;well documented&#8221;:http://www.karelia.com/news/small_and_nimble_the_long_s.html so I won&#8217;t repeat it here.</p>
<p>But when listening to the &#8220;Macworld podcast&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/mwpodcast.html a week ago (the episode with Dan Moren and Jason Snell back from the iPhone 3.0 announcement) it struck me that iPhone software is a little unique. They made the point, which I think is true for most software, that Apple&#8217;s offering is usually simple, full of holes that could be filled with new features from third-party developers. There is usually room for a developer with a unique twist on an idea to market and sell his solution to like-minded users, even if Apple ships a default good-enough app for most people.</p>
<p>Except there&#8217;s one pretty significant problem, especially on the iPhone. Apple cheats.</p>
<p>Third-party apps cannot run in the background. So it doesn&#8217;t matter how many features a recording app has that Apple won&#8217;t bother to implement, background recording is the killer feature that will always remain out of reach for developers.</p>
<p>Put another way, if the Apple app didn&#8217;t record in the background and a third-party app could, that third-party app would likely be worth $5-10 to many people for that one feature alone. But give Apple background recording and it doesn&#8217;t matter how many features another app adds &mdash; syncing music, FTPing to a server, multiple tracks, sound effects, more file formats &mdash; it&#8217;s going to be a challenge to convince users they need two recording apps. I expect some audio developers to overcompensate by adding every feature listed above and more to make up for the one feature they can&#8217;t have.</p>

			<p>Last week my &#8220;@wii&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii account on Twitter passed 3000 followers and seems to finally be growing strong after a year of neglect. I now try to post once every couple days with Nintendo news, and I&#8217;ll eventually throw in a tweet on new Wii Transfer updates. That was my evil plan from the beginning: have some fun with the account but also use it to build an audience and promote my own projects.</p>
<p>I view @wii as a gift. I don&#8217;t know how long it will be under my control. As Twitter continues to go mainstream, eventually I expect Nintendo will want my little 3-character Twitter name for themselves, and I might just be glad to hand it off. Twitter works best with a personal voice, and I&#8217;ve already all but closed some of my secondary accounts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more conflicted about what to do with the &#8220;Wii Friend Codes site&#8221;:http://wiitransfer.com/codes/. At one time I imagined it as a full Riverfold product, with integrated Mac and iPhone apps, but now I find that I lack the passion to really take it to new places. And to be honest, it works as is.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;People talk about how wonderful are features like re-writing history &mdash; and I read that stuff and think, &#8216;Wow, Git&#8217;s really cool and powerful.&#8217; But then I know it could suck me in and take away time from _real_ work.

<p>I haven&#8217;t used Git much since Daniel and I discussed it on an early &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ episode.

<p>I like what Brent did a few months ago with his blog redesign, how both inessential.com and ranchero.com complement each other. He also wrote &#8220;more about his publishing system&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head, including a bit in passing about the tool I used to start my blog, Radio Userland.</p>
