			<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to link to this since it was posted earlier in the year. &#8220;Jens Alfke hopes&#8221;:http://mooseyard.com/Jens/2009/02/what-will-web-30-be/ for a decentralized future Web 3.0:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Centralization creates concentrations of power, and that&#8217;s dangerous. The people who run the servers have total control over your (and everyone&#8217;s) data. They can snoop at it (however private it&#8217;s supposed to be), they can sell it to advertisers, they can accidentally lose it, they can accidentally expose it to hackers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. Even for the best-loved centralized companies, like Twitter and Flickr, I want a copy of my data. If the first set of desktop tools to interface with web services were all about sharing and publishing, the next software generation will need to also effortlessly download and backup that data. Even usually careful programmers &#8220;sometimes get it wrong&#8221;:http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=990323.</p>
<p>Jens goes on to talk about CouchDB, including a link to &#8220;this intro book&#8221;:http://books.couchdb.org/relax/. Looks good. Couch and &#8220;other no-SQL database systems&#8221;:http://nosql-database.org/ like Mongo are interesting technologies that I&#8217;d probably come up with an excuse to use if MySQL wasn&#8217;t such a workhorse already. Related, for the Ruby fans in the audience: &#8220;Phil Burrows on logging with Mongo&#8221;:http://blog.philburrows.com/articles/2009/09/28/rails-logging-with-mongodb/.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I let my iPhone developer account expire last week. Even though I had already stopped development on my iPhone projects, officially letting go of even the temptation to build for the iPhone platform has really helped me focus.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Rogue Amoeba rejection for Airfoil Speakers Touch&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2009/11/13/airfoil-speakers-touch-1-0-1-finally-ships/ has been covered on Twitter and &#8220;at Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2009/11/airfoil_touch_situation, but I think it&#8217;s easy to get distracted by legal technicalities and not the heart of the matter: as long as Apple is the gatekeeper, there will be bad decisions and apps that deserve to be approved will be rejected instead. For this reason the App Store cannot be fixed with incremental improvements.</p>
<p>There are only two possible solutions:</p>
<h1>Accept all applications. Joe Hewitt, the developer of the Facebook application who this week also quit the App Store, &#8220;has written well on this solution&#8221;:http://joehewitt.com/post/innocent-until-proven-guilty/.</h1>
<h1>Allow applications to be installed on the phone without being listed in the App Store. Both Android and the Palm Pre &#8220;support this model&#8221;:http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/05/palm-free-apps-for-the-web-free-development-for-open-source-and-free-pres/.</h1>
<p>There is no third or fourth solution. There is no compromise or small improvement to the review process. Better transparency or tiered support options won&#8217;t help either. Without either of the above two changes, rejections will continue because in a subjective review process there will always be bad judgement calls. Some percentage of indie developers will abandon the iPhone either because the risk is too great or based on principle alone.</p>
<p>Let me take the second one (allow applications to be installed without being listed) because it plays directly to this Rogue Amoeba rejection. Rogue Amoeba is one of my favorite Mac companies, and Daniel Jalkut and I record &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ using their Audio Hijack Pro app. It&#8217;s universally regarded as great software.</p>
<p>It might surprise you to find out that Audio Hijack Pro is not listed in the &#8220;Apple Downloads&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/ site, though other Rogue Amoeba products such as Fission, Nicecast, and Airfoil are. I&#8217;m not sure Rogue Amoeba has ever spoken on the record about this, but Apple apparently doesn&#8217;t like the app and won&#8217;t list it. Maybe because you can use it to record copyrighted music? Who knows.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t matter because being rejected from Apple Downloads doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t make Mac software! It just means you have to market the software yourself. Rogue Amoeba has to work extra hard to get the word out about the app, but their business won&#8217;t fail just because Apple doesn&#8217;t give it their blessing.</p>
<p>This is so important for a small company. I want my software to fail because it sucks, or is buggy, or doesn&#8217;t have the right features, not because Apple can shut me down over a minor difference of opinion.</p>
<p>There are a lot of well-intentioned suggestions for improving the App Store, but the result will always be the same until we acknowledge the root problem. The only fix is for Apple to remove itself as gatekeeper, or let us route around them.</p>

			<p>I talked in &#8220;Core Intuition episode 22&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2009/08/episode-22-not-just-a-hobby/ about how I&#8217;ve stopped working on my indie iPhone apps. Mike Ash is also done with it. &#8220;He writes&#8221;:http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/the-iphone-development-story-one-year-later.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have abandoned the platform. Apple&#8217;s nonsense is just too much for me. There&#8217;s no joy in iPhone development, and an enormous amount of frustration.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading through the comments got me thinking. I&#8217;m not abandoning the iPhone just because the App Store is such a frustrating environment to run a business in, or that I have a bunch of real work I could be doing instead of playing games with Apple. It&#8217;s also because most of the apps I would write have already been done, and in some cases done very well.</p>
<p>I love having a small computer in my pocket and mine is full of third-party apps. I&#8217;m thankful for the developers who are coming from other platforms and focusing all of their attention on the phone. And they are thrilled to be an a platform that is such a step up from traditional mobile development. The financial success stories of developers hitting on a great idea and it just taking off in the App Store are real and inspiring.</p>
<p>But the iPhone doesn&#8217;t need me.</p>
<p>As a user there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;ll give up the phone, but as a developer I can focus my time on &#8220;things that I have control over&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/, and add value to places where no one else has a good solution. Perceived gold rush or not, stretching myself too thin with both iPhone and Mac development is a great way to fail at both.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment that &#8220;Yellow Box for Windows&#8221;:http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?YellowBox wasn&#8217;t killed off &mdash; that we could build Windows apps using Cocoa. Should I make my apps cross-platform just because it&#8217;s Objective-C? No. Writing software for a platform I don&#8217;t use would be like still supporting Mac OS X 10.2; there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to boot into that thing to test and fix my app.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Mac developer, my message to you is the same: just because the iPhone is awesome and runs on Objective-C <em>does not mean you are required to build software for it</em>. Maybe your time would be better spent refining old apps or building new ones on the Mac. Maybe&#8230; the iPhone doesn&#8217;t need you, either.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I mentioned on the &#8220;latest Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2009/08/episode-22-not-just-a-hobby/ that I no longer have any plans to release my own iPhone software. While that decision is mostly based on my unwillingness to give Apple so much control over my business, and frustrations with the App Store process in particular, there are a handful of technical reasons why iPhone development is not a good fit for me. Here&#8217;s one: open source.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel Jalkut&#8217;s essay on the GPL&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/825/getting-pretty-lonely hits all the points about how the GPL can hurt developers by discouraging commercial participation. I&#8217;ve used LGPL projects in both &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ and &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/, and I am careful to use them correctly. But iPhone development presents an interesting problem.</p>
<p><em>Can&#8217;t run command line tools.</em> Separating the GPL code into a command line tool that is inside your application bundle is a common way to get around licensing issues. This is not allowed in the iPhone SDK.</p>
<p><em>Can&#8217;t replace dynamic libraries.</em> The LGPL says that you can also link to libraries at runtime, but the catch is that the user must be able to replace an LGPL library with a newer version of their choosing. There is no way for normal users to do this on the iPhone.</p>
<p><em>Can&#8217;t use private frameworks.</em> Oh, that point above about dynamic libraries? Actually it&#8217;s a moot point because Apple requires everything to be statically linked anyway. So you are blocked at every pass; you can&#8217;t ship an app that loads code dynamically even if the user could touch it.</p>
<p>The only solution I&#8217;ve seen so far is to release a special version of your Xcode project, with most of your application split into compiled libraries instead of source code, and allow developers with the iPhone SDK to relink your application with a different copy of whatever LGPL code you used. I stopped researching this when I put my own iPhone projects on hold, though. It&#8217;s just another example of how the closed nature of the platform creates an unnecessary burden in the software development process.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I get a lot of funny looks when I tell people I host everything on Dreamhost. It&#8217;s not a great fit for everything &mdash; I have some ideas for projects that would be better suited to Amazon EC2, and who knows, maybe I&#8217;ve just been on a lucky server &mdash; but it has generally been more reliable than any previous hosting company I&#8217;ve used, including when I used to run my own server.</p>
<p>Dreamhost succeeds because of scale. They have so many servers, and such low prices, that they are forced to automate everything. This means they can more quickly deploy new software, rebuild servers, or restore a broken installation, and that their panel interface has to provide access to every feature a customer might want.</p>
<p>&#8220;This post from their status blog&#8221;:http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2009/07/18/network-problems-due-to-distribution-switch/ is revealing. There are over 600 machines on that list, but it must be only some fraction of their customer base, because my server name isn&#8217;t on there. &#8220;According to WebHosting.Info&#8221;:http://www.webhosting.info/webhosts/reports/total_domains/DREAMHOST.COM, Dreamhost hosts about 875,000 domains.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that &#8220;being small is a competitive advantage&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/customer.html, but anyone who&#8217;s played the role of sys admin knows that automation means everything, and that&#8217;s what Dreamhost seems to get right.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;Huge post from Craig Hockenberry&#8221;:http://furbo.org/2009/07/10/year-two/ on the App Store. Lots of good points. I especially like the insight comparing it to the music store, the need for upgrade revenue, and ideas for improving discoverability.</p>
<p>Where I have a problem is at the $999.</p>
<p>Not for support or early access to new versions of the iPhone OS, that&#8217;s fine. ADC Select and Premier members are used to paying for non-essential bonuses. The issue is whether we should pay extra to work around a problem that Apple has created for themselves and developers.</p>
<p>And I totally respect that Craig is just throwing out a bunch of possible solutions, hoping that something will stick, that Apple will start to pay attention and draw inspiration from the community. &#8220;As he said on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/chockenberry/status/2577781479: &#8220;I just want to put money where my mouth is.&#8221; I think the $999 figure speaks to just how painful this process has become. Luckily developers are also natural problem-solvers, forever hopeful even when desperate.</p>
<p>But just as the $99 fee to become an iPhone developer didn&#8217;t filter out the junk apps and unserious developers new to the platform, neither will throwing more money at the problem make it go away. The gold rush is still on, and we should expect app submissions to only accelerate.</p>
<p>Most importantly, let&#8217;s take a step back and remember: <em>it was Apple&#8217;s choice to build a closed system, one in which they alone could approve and deny apps</em>. The idea that we should pay extra because they underestimated how much work it would be to approve thousands of apps really bothers me. It would be punishing developers for Apple&#8217;s own failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colin Barrett pointed out&#8221;:http://twitter.com/cbarrett/status/2576856894 that Apple loses money on free apps, when you consider server overhead and review staff. I find it difficult to believe that Apple is doing anything except raking in the cash from the App Store. After all, they are used to giving away bandwidth for a number of products: Safari and QuickTime downloads, iLife and iWork software updates, not to mention updates to Mac OS X itself.</p>
<p>From an article back in May, &#8220;Techcrunch also assumes&#8221;:http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/14/about-those-iphone-app-store-numbers/ that Apple is doing quite well off the App Store:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;$1 million a day means that Apple would be making $300,000 a day (its 30% cut). Extrapolated out over 10 months (the approximate age of the App Store), that would be about $90 million.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to believe that there is a solution to this. A quick reading of &#8220;AppShopper.com&#8221;:http://www.appshopper.com/ shows that on some days up to 100-200 apps go live on the store. That&#8217;s a lot of apps. But Apple is a large company, and they&#8217;ve surely dealt with more difficult staffing problems than <em>hiring some people who know how to use an iPhone</em>.</p>
<p>Other than a handful of exceptions in the jailbreak community, iPhone developers are playing by the rules Apple created. The burden is on Apple to deliver fast reviews, and it&#8217;s something that all developers deserve, not just a select few with extra cash to burn.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>There&#8217;s always the risk when developing for Mac OS X that Apple will compete directly with your product. iTunes, Mail, and Safari are high-profile examples, as well as the &#8220;lightning strikes twice&#8221; hit of Watson/Sherlock and Sandvox/iWeb. That history is &#8220;well documented&#8221;:http://www.karelia.com/news/small_and_nimble_the_long_s.html so I won&#8217;t repeat it here.</p>
<p>But when listening to the &#8220;Macworld podcast&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/mwpodcast.html a week ago (the episode with Dan Moren and Jason Snell back from the iPhone 3.0 announcement) it struck me that iPhone software is a little unique. They made the point, which I think is true for most software, that Apple&#8217;s offering is usually simple, full of holes that could be filled with new features from third-party developers. There is usually room for a developer with a unique twist on an idea to market and sell his solution to like-minded users, even if Apple ships a default good-enough app for most people.</p>
<p>Except there&#8217;s one pretty significant problem, especially on the iPhone. Apple cheats.</p>
<p>Third-party apps cannot run in the background. So it doesn&#8217;t matter how many features a recording app has that Apple won&#8217;t bother to implement, background recording is the killer feature that will always remain out of reach for developers.</p>
<p>Put another way, if the Apple app didn&#8217;t record in the background and a third-party app could, that third-party app would likely be worth $5-10 to many people for that one feature alone. But give Apple background recording and it doesn&#8217;t matter how many features another app adds &mdash; syncing music, FTPing to a server, multiple tracks, sound effects, more file formats &mdash; it&#8217;s going to be a challenge to convince users they need two recording apps. I expect some audio developers to overcompensate by adding every feature listed above and more to make up for the one feature they can&#8217;t have.</p>

			<p>Last week my &#8220;@wii&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii account on Twitter passed 3000 followers and seems to finally be growing strong after a year of neglect. I now try to post once every couple days with Nintendo news, and I&#8217;ll eventually throw in a tweet on new Wii Transfer updates. That was my evil plan from the beginning: have some fun with the account but also use it to build an audience and promote my own projects.</p>
<p>I view @wii as a gift. I don&#8217;t know how long it will be under my control. As Twitter continues to go mainstream, eventually I expect Nintendo will want my little 3-character Twitter name for themselves, and I might just be glad to hand it off. Twitter works best with a personal voice, and I&#8217;ve already all but closed some of my secondary accounts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more conflicted about what to do with the &#8220;Wii Friend Codes site&#8221;:http://wiitransfer.com/codes/. At one time I imagined it as a full Riverfold product, with integrated Mac and iPhone apps, but now I find that I lack the passion to really take it to new places. And to be honest, it works as is.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Brent Simmons is still looking&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2009/03/07/still_looking_for_a_version_control_syst for the perfect version control system:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People talk about how wonderful are features like re-writing history &mdash; and I read that stuff and think, &#8216;Wow, Git&#8217;s really cool and powerful.&#8217; But then I know it could suck me in and take away time from _real_ work. It&#8217;s _already_ more work &mdash; _for me_ &mdash; than when using Subversion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used Git much since Daniel and I discussed it on an early &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ episode. Like Brent I just don&#8217;t see a big win for single-person projects, although it&#8217;s fascinating to watch how open source projects are using &#8220;Github&#8221;:http://github.com/.</p>
<p>I like what Brent did a few months ago with his blog redesign, how both inessential.com and ranchero.com complement each other. He also wrote &#8220;more about his publishing system&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head, including a bit in passing about the tool I used to start my blog, Radio Userland.</p>
<p>I mention it because this blog is 7 years old today. Happy birthday to manton.org.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;Dave Winer proposes&#8221;:http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/01/05/rethinkingAuthentication.html a simple solution to revoking authentication in web services:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now imagine that Twitter had a page that showed all the IP addresses that have used your login in the last 30 days, with a start date for each and a count of calls made. I bet you could figure out which one was The Greasy Spoon Group, pronto. Further suppose there was a checkbox next to each IP address. You could uncheck that one, click Submit, and voila, no more spam from your account.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>There are important things missing here, such as not sharing your credentials, but I have to admit I do like the simplicity. If the hostnames were grouped by user agent, the UI wouldn&#8217;t even be half bad. If nothing else, maybe this will light a fire under OAuth implementors to get moving. (And I count myself in that group too, since I&#8217;m involved with some services that need OAuth pretty badly.)</p>
<p>If you &#8220;string together tweets from Alex Payne&#8221;:http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&amp;ands=oauth&amp;phrase=&amp;ors=&amp;nots=&amp;tag=&amp;lang=all&amp;from=al3x&amp;to=&amp;ref=&amp;near=&amp;within=15&amp;units=mi&amp;since=&amp;until=&amp;rpp=50, it makes for an interesting narrative about OAuth too.</p>

			<p>I don&#8217;t link to Daring Fireball much anymore. Everyone who cares about the Mac and reads my blog, also likely reads his. I will link or write about obviously redundant topics that everyone else is also writing about only when I feel like I can add some kind of value. I felt that way with &#8220;my short NDA post&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2008/10/nda_and.html, putting it in the context of customers.</p>
<p>But John Gruber&#8217;s latest, &#8220;The Fear&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2008/10/the_fear, is just too good not to link to. Many developers and professional bloggers can write passionately about rejected iPhone apps, but no one connected that to the default dock and its significance in the original device introduction by Steve Jobs. Whether the theory is true, we may never know, but man is it a good read.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>When &#8220;MobileMe&#8221;:http://www.me.com/ launched with a beautiful new design, the web application suite was essentially unusable because of terrible performance. Timeouts and slow page refreshes were the norm. At the time, I didn&#8217;t think too much of this. I just waited a couple of weeks until they had either improved their backend infrastructure or until traffic had died down enough to make the site work again.</p>
<p>But one thing that did catch my eye is the insane number of Ajax hits from the SproutCore-based UI. Even &#8220;Cappuccino&#8221;:http://cappuccino.org/, which I praise as brilliant to everyone I talk to, seems to join Gmail&#8217;s progress bar with this same loading overhead cruft.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m reading too much into it, but I think as work shifts from the server side to JavaScript there is the potential for waste and chattiness. It&#8217;s like the countless pixel spacers from the 1990s table-based designs all over again.</p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s a counter-argument to this, that you can cut down on the weight of hits by just sending snippets of JSON or some other lightweight format without the baggage of too many HTML tags, but in practice I think the overhead of the large JavaScript libraries and resources to construct modern app-like UIs overshadow potential gains.</p>
<p>Unavoidable? Maybe. Or maybe most applications will still benefit from &#8220;traditional&#8221; Ajax. &#8220;Twitter recently redesigned&#8221;:http://blog.twitter.com/2008/09/changes-afoot.html and made their web site faster in that way. Instead of a completely new client-driven interaction model, they just take pieces of the web site and load content without requiring a full page refresh. Easy wins. Web 3.0 not required.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I certainly feel like I&#8217;ve been talking about the iPhone a lot, particularly for a company that doesn&#8217;t currently have any iPhone software available. There are many reasons for that, but perhaps most important is that we believe the iPhone is a fantastically promising platform, and we don&#8217;t want to see that promise squandered.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In some ways it feels like nothing has changed since March when I &#8220;posted here about the iPhone NDA&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2008/03/iphone_sdk_and_ndas.html. I guess I&#8217;m disappointed that there hasn&#8217;t been more public conversation about building iPhone apps until now, but there&#8217;s definitely an attitude change just in the last few weeks &mdash; one in which fear of Apple&#8217;s lawyers is replaced with something closer to rebellion: posting sample code, blogging extensively, and abusing ad-hoc distribution. It&#8217;s right and healthy for developers to become as distrustful toward Apple as Apple has been hostile to developers.</p>

			<p>No, I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;Dave Winer&#8217;s thoughts&#8221;:http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews on RSS reader design exactly, although that&#8217;s part of it. It&#8217;s more the way we in the technology community interact with the world. Hundreds of news feeds, company chat, external IRC channels, private AIM, email dinging every 5 minutes, and the constant flow of tweets. At home, we&#8217;re connected essentially 24/7; on the road, the iPhone brings it all with us. Plus there&#8217;s the never-ending pile of work to do on too many projects.</p>
<p>Technology news or politics or development moves too fast and doesn&#8217;t slow down. It&#8217;s easy to feel like you&#8217;re being pulled down the river, one hand struggling to hold on to the raft and the other deep in the current, information overload all around.</p>
<p>Since coming back from C4 I&#8217;d been fighting a cold, which developed into a cough and sinus infection and fever and whatever worse. I finally hit the doctor up last week and just unplugged, checking email twice a day for emergencies only. I spent the rest of the day sleeping, reading, and with family &mdash; a self-imposed vacation for my brain as much as my body.</p>
<p>Four days later I&#8217;m feeling quite a bit better, and trying to think about what changes to make in my schedule so as to not wind up insane or dead before I&#8217;m 35. But even as I say that I acknowledge that it&#8217;s stretching the truth, because I&#8217;ve never been happier.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Buzz Andersen responds&#8221;:http://log.scifihifi.com/post/47592954/heres-an-idea-i-could-take-my-newly-minted to some of Mike Lee&#8217;s recent blog posts:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re living in the &#8216;anyone can play guitar&#8217; era of software entrepreneurship. Because of the confluence of increasingly accessible developer tools and the Internet, it&#8217;s now reasonable to think that one or two talented people, with little to no investment, can make anything from a good living to a fortune by bringing their idea to life. What kills me about the outmoded Silicon Valley gold rush mentality that I feel has entered the Mac developer community for the first time because of the iPhone is how much it fundamentally ignores the significance of Apple&#8217;s App Store as a field leveler.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I was at first disappointed that I had no time (either at VitalSource or for my own projects) to have an iPhone app at launch, as the weeks and months pass since the App Store opened I find myself less and less sure about what the App Store market actually looks like. Everything is changing very quickly. While there is no doubt a huge opportunity in iPhone development &mdash; and with another 30-40 million iPhones hitting next year, each of those new customers will have their own impulse buys and novelty purchases, to say nothing of the real apps that people need on their phone &mdash; at the same time I wonder when iPhone development will be as mature and stable as the Mac software market is.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a direct comment on what Buzz is saying. His blog and comments on &#8220;Mike&#8217;s post&#8221;:http://www.atomicwang.org/motherfucker/Index/832D1CF5-BDF8-493D-945A-E95105682EDC.html are right-on as usual.</p>

			<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to give the silly $999 &#8220;I Am Rich&#8221; iPhone application any more attention after the initial laugh, but the more that everyone reacts to what went wrong the more clear it becomes that there is something to learn here. &#8220;Kottke thinks Apple shouldn&#8217;t restrict&#8221;:http://www.kottke.org/08/08/the-1000-iphone-app based on taste; &#8220;Ryan Irelan points to no shopping cart&#8221;:http://www.ryanirelan.com/blog/entry/the-1000-iphone-app/ as the problem; &#8220;Dan Benjamin mostly agrees&#8221;:http://hivelogic.com/articles/2008/08/regarding-iphone-application-pricing but with some more analysis; and &#8220;John Gruber hits the same points&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/08/07/i-am-rich and mentions (in passing) what I think is the real problem: refunds.</p>
<p>iPhone developers have wondered for months how refunds were going to be handled. Although demo and trial versions (if added) will be used by many more customers, refunds to unhappy customers represent an extremely important part of the relationship between developer and customer. I&#8217;ve written before about &#8220;my philosophy with refunds&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/customer.html and customer support, an opinion that is shared pretty universally in the Mac community. Just yesterday I gave a refund to a customer who purchased the software over a year ago, but apparently didn&#8217;t get around to actually using it recently and found it did not meet his needs.</p>
<p>If there were a proper way for developers to send App Store refunds &mdash; because of unmet expectations (app crashes or doesn&#8217;t work as advertised) or accidental purchases (my son bought this without asking me) &mdash; then this issue just goes away. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether I Am Rich is worth $999 or whether the shopping cart should be an option in iTunes. The core issue is refunds because it fixes several problems at once, and removes Apple&#8217;s personal judgement about what is good or bad for iPhone users.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I first heard of the &#8220;Flip&#8221;:http://www.theflip.com/products_flip_ultra.shtml a few months ago, but it wasn&#8217;t until &#8220;this 37signals post&#8221;:http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/923-the-flip-takes-13-of-the-camcorder-market-by-doing-less that I started paying attention. I was attracted to the simplicity of the video camera: few buttons, decent quality, and kid-proof design. Here is my mini-review.</p>
<p><b>Speed</b>. This is where the Flip shines. It is compact enough to take anywhere, and simple enough that you can take it out of your pocket and start shooting video in seconds. I&#8217;ve already shot way more video than I would with my traditional DV camcorder.</p>
<p><b>Battery</b>. It runs on two AA batteries. I was able to record a ton of video before replacing them, accumulating 3 GB of files over several weeks. This is unheard of compared to any other still camera or video camera I&#8217;ve owned.</p>
<p><b>Transfer</b>. The Flip saves as the Xvid flavor of MPEG-4, which is not supported natively by QuickTime. Luckily a quick &#8220;Perian install&#8221;:http://www.perian.org/ later and you can view and edit them in QuickTime Player or any app that supports QuickTime. Just mount the camera and copy them over, or convert to H.264 with something like VisualHub. The &#8220;Wii Transfer 2.6&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/beta/ beta also supports Xvid to convert and share to your Wii.</p>
<p><b>Quality</b>. I wanted to do a side-by-side comparison with Motion JPEG used on most digital still cameras, but this isn&#8217;t a video hardware review site so an in-depth analysis is beyond the scope of what I need or have expertise in. To my eyes it looks pretty good though. Make sure to get the Ultra, not the regular Flip Video which has a lower bitrate.</p>
<p><b>Complaints</b>. You need to give the power slider and record buttons some real pressure, and on a few occasions I&#8217;ve clicked record only to realize 1 minute later that it didn&#8217;t start. I understand that the designers didn&#8217;t want us turning it on or recording unintentionally, but this negates some of the speed advantage mentioned above.</p>
<p>In a nutshell: The Flip isn&#8217;t for everyone, but at just $140 it&#8217;s hard to argue with its strengths. I take it everywhere now. One pocket for iPhone, one pocket for Flip.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The MacBook Air is the first Apple product to come along in years that I don&#8217;t want to buy. It looks great, the multi-touch trackpad is cool and unexpected, and I like Remote Disk. But it&#8217;s just not significantly different than a MacBook to me, and I don&#8217;t travel enough to make the thinness or weight really matter. To &#8220;upgrade&#8221; from a regular MacBook to an Air just seems wasteful.</p>
<p>The &#8220;new Apple&#8221; has been doing a great job of eliminating duplicates in their product line (only one tower, only one of each size of iPod). If the Air had an 11-inch or 12-inch screen it would be a much easier sell because it becomes clear why the product exists: buy this if you want something small.</p>
<p>For two months in 1999, my wife and I travelled through Europe with only a backpack each and a PowerBook 520c to share between us. That machine was very small (just a 9.5-inch screen), yet she did contract work for Apple on it and I coded and released new versions of Mac software, dialed up to the net via modem from hotel rooms and hostels in the days before wi-fi. It was much heavier than an Air but for traveling light it was still a great choice.</p>
<p>It feels like Apple missed an opportunity at Macworld yesterday. I&#8217;m not particularly disappointed, though, since I wasn&#8217;t one of those hoping for a sub-notebook.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;m going to skip the usual Macworld predictions and cut straight to the good stuff: Apple needs a tablet for the huge numbers of artists and creative professionals who have stuck with the Mac for so long, or who are finally coming back to the platform. I hope for this every year, but the evidence is starting to mount that yes, Apple is working on something.</p>
<p>John Gruber &#8220;doesn&#8217;t see a tablet happening&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2008/01/macworld_expo_predictions:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But why force software UI&#8217;s designed for traditional hardware form factors upon a totally different device? A successful tablet-like device from Apple, I think, would clearly be designed as a secondary computing device &mdash; a satellite attached and synched to a Mac or PC (probably, of course, through iTunes).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think his reasoning is exactly correct <em>if</em> you think about a tablet as just a Newton or large iPhone, but as I say above I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the market at all. Honestly as much as I loved the Newton, the iPhone works great as a replacement. The primary market for a Mac tablet is the millions of people who look at the &#8220;Wacom Cintiq&#8221;:http://www.wacom.com/cintiq/ and drool. An Apple tablet has to run full Mac OS X because it has to run Photoshop, Acorn, and Painter.</p>
<p>(Both Gruber and Dan Benjamin also discuss predictions during the latest &#8220;The Talk Show episode&#8221;:http://www.thetalkshow.net/, just posted. While you&#8217;re listening, also check out the &#8220;Hivelogic comprehensive podcasting guide&#8221;:http://hivelogic.com/articles/podcasting-equipment-guide/.)</p>
<p>So what about this: what if the MacBook sub-notebook and the tablet are one and the same? Imagine a beautiful slim MacBook with a detachable keyboard and touch-sensitive display, for example. Avoid the weird connections by making the keyboard Bluetooth only, with all the guts of the machine (including flash-based hard drive) behind the screen. I have a first-generation Toshiba Tablet PC and the hardware design is just bulky and terrible because they tried to make it all things to all people. A MacBook Nano-Tablet-Air could embrace &#8220;thin&#8221; and &#8220;tablet&#8221; and ignore everything else to achieve a truly great design.</p>
<p>But who knows. We&#8217;ll see in about 30 minutes.</p>
