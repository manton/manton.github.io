			<p>&#8220;Steven Frank&#8221;:http://stevenf.com/2007/11/try_again.php on Google&#8217;s phone announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Find someone, ONE person, with a unique vision. Lock them in a room with some programmers and a graphic designer. Twenty people, tops. Change the world. Quit re-hashing the same old bullshit and telling me it&#8217;s new, exciting, or in any way innovative. Be ready to fail, many times, but for love of all that is holy take a stand on something.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I heard about the Google phone consortium pretty much exclusively through Twitter, and the reaction seems about universal from the folks I follow (admittedly, half of them are total Mac geeks). I&#8217;m honestly not sure how the Google phone is relevant to me, but then again, I don&#8217;t like Gmail.</p>
<p>Although this week&#8217;s &#8220;37signals post on personas&#8221;:http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/690-ask-37signals-personas isn&#8217;t about Android, some of the points are relevant to committee-led design:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can build a great product for a person that doesn&#8217;t exist. And I definitely don&#8217;t think you can build a great product based on a composite sketch of 10 different people all rolled into one (or two or three).&#8221; [&#8230;] &#8220;Every product we build is a product we build for ourselves to solve our own problems.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Not using your own product can turn into a real problem, and I realized after I bought an Apple TV that &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ suffered from it. So I forced myself to use my own product instead, and that made all the difference. Plus, it was easy to unplug the Apple TV because the thing got so hot I was worried it would burn the house down while I slept.</p>

			<p>Ambrosia Software&#8217;s &#8220;Andrew Welch in a TUAW interview&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/10/03/tuaw-interview-ambrosias-andrew-welch-on-the-iphone-update-and/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The tack they are taking with the ringtones, though, is not &#8216;We&#8217;ll provide such great ringtones that you&#8217;ll want to buy from us&#8217; but rather &#8216;This is all you&#8217;re ever going to be able to use, too bad if you want to use something else.&#8217; I think they took a winning formula, and got it entirely backwards.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the most disappointing part of what Apple is doing. Even with the iTunes Store, when they had to lock down the songs to appease the music industry, they still thought about the user: songs on 5 machines, unlimited iPods, multiple iTunes accounts on the same machine, great selection, and effortless buying experience. I can wait for a real iPhone SDK (WWDC 2008 please Apple kthxbye), but Apple of all companies should not let corporate deals needlessly cripple the ringtone user experience.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Episode 11 of &#8220;The Talk Show&#8221;:http://www.thetalkshow.net/ is up, and I&#8217;m happy to say that &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ is this week&#8217;s sponsor. Even if you&#8217;ve been subscribed since the first show, click over to see the new site design by &#8220;Airbag Industries&#8221;:http://airbagindustries.com/. It&#8217;s beautifully done and I tried to create an ad graphic that feels at home there.</p>
<p>For the Wii Transfer ad text I included &#8220;Only for Mac&#8221;, partly to discourage any Windows listeners from clicking and to set expectations that Wii Transfer is not a web site, but also because after a decade of being ignored I think Mac users like to be reminded that there is a bunch of great software just for them.</p>
<p>Earlier this month &#8220;Daniel Jalkut wrote about the unlikelihood of MarsEdit for Windows&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/394/blogging-from-windows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I love writing software for the Mac. If I had to write software for another platform, I probably wouldn&#8217;t be nearly as interested in doing it. Heck, I might work more on becoming a musician, or a designer, or one of the other many trades that I have an interest in. For that reason, the chances of MarsEdit for Windows are almost nil.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I love that Mac indies are receiving so many &#8220;what about a Windows version?&#8221; requests. I get similar emails every couple weeks about Wii Transfer for Windows, and luckily there are a couple Windows or open source alternatives that I can point people to. (Some of them are even cross-platform and available for Mac, but they are of the &#8220;double click this Java .jar file&#8221; variety, so I don&#8217;t generally consider them direct competition.)</p>
<p>It used to feel strange getting these requests. I would respond with &#8220;maybe&#8221; and &#8220;unlikely&#8221;, suggesting that it&#8217;s probably not going to happen but leaving open the possibility, as Daniel did when he said &#8220;almost nil&#8221;. Then I realized &mdash; who am I kidding? &mdash; I&#8217;m <em>never</em> going to port this to Windows regardless of demand. Never. &#8220;With the right team&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ I enjoy working on cross-platform apps, just as I appreciate meetings, planning, and the other formalities (in moderation) that come with a more corporate environment. But Wii Transfer isn&#8217;t about any of that; it&#8217;s my vacation from the real world, and on my time I use and build for Macs.</p>
<p>Also read the Airfoil for Windows section of &#8220;Ars Technica&#8217;s interview with Paul Kafasis&#8221;:http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/2/2/6863 from February.</p>

			<p>Soundtrack for this blog post: &#8220;The Touch&#8221;:http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=254632798&amp;s=143441&amp;i=254632948 from the 1980s Transformers feature.</p>
<p>Yesterday Apple announced new iPods, plus cool stuff like the Starbucks integration and iTunes Wi-fi Store. I was out at lunch and errands, so I followed the announcements on my iPhone with Safari and Twitter. If the new store had been available, I probably would have bought some music too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave Winer had mixed feelings about the new stuff&#8221;:http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/09/05/will2007BeLike1984.html, but likes how the iPod is evolving to be its own full-featured client:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They are interesting if only because they illustrate so clearly that it&#8217;s possible to get content onto the iPod directly, without synching, without tethering to a laptop or desktop computer. I think the users will love this, and it will quickly become the primary way music gets on the device.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The $200 price drop on the iPhone was a surprise. My first thought: Apple is totally playing to win. With such an aggressive price drop, they plan to own the high-end market, and maybe some of the middle too. It never crossed my mind that I was ripped off paying $599 until I started reading &#8220;comments in this TUAW post&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/09/05/apple-lowers-price-of-8-gig-iphone-to-399/. These are the same kind of people who say &#8220;I like your software but <em>I wish it was free</em>&#8221; to indie Mac developers.</p>
<p>The iPhone was expensive at $599 but worth it, and the new price doesn&#8217;t change that fact. It&#8217;s allowed me to work even more remotely, stay connected to friends, get unlost using maps in a new city, and greatly improve how I use a mobile phone.</p>
<p>(I wrote most of the rest of this blog post a couple weeks ago. It was originally titled &#8220;1000 emails in your pocket&#8221;, but that was before I saw Craig Hockenberry&#8217;s excellent &#8220;Benchmarking in your pants&#8221;:http://furbo.org/2007/08/15/benchmarking-in-your-pants/ blog post, which while not as directly accurate to Apple&#8217;s original iPod marketing, was much more funny.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to post specifically about the sessions at C4 yet, because anything I say would be redundant against posts from &#8220;Alex Payne&#8221;:http://www.al3x.net/2007/08/c41-friday.html, &#8220;John Gruber&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2007/08/c4_1_in_a_nut, and &#8220;Mike Zornek&#8221;:http://blog.clickablebliss.com/2007/08/13/c41-retrospective/, among others. Instead I want to follow up &#8220;my original iPhone report&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/07/iphone_its_from.html with how the phone performed during travel.</p>
<p>There were a <em>lot</em> of iPhones at last month&#8217;s C4 conference. I had such good luck using the iPhone at the airport and on the train and walking around Chicago, I took my MacBook&#8217;s dead battery as a sign to stick to the iPhone all weekend, using it exclusively for email, Twitter, blog reading, and general web surfing. I responded to a handful of emails, used SMS for sending tweets, and hit the iPhone version of Newsgator Online (synced from my NetNewsWire subscriptions) for news and blogs.</p>
<p>Sure, I was jealous of everyone running Twitterific while I had to refresh m.twitter.com manually, but overall the experience was great. As &#8220;Matt Haughey has blogged about&#8221;:http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2007/07/01/24-hours-with-the-iphone-my-dream-mini-computer/: the iPhone is a computer, and 3 full days of use proved to me that it&#8217;s extremely competent.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to two weeks ago and I went on a weekend road-trip to Dallas with only the iPhone, confident I could respond to email if needed. Same thing over the long Labor Day holiday: drove 7 hours both ways for 2 nights in Louisiana, easily able to follow up on bugs from a recent software release without my MacBook.</p>
<p>Of course there are a few rough edges: I don&#8217;t do significant server-side spam filtering, so deleting spam on the iPhone is getting tedious; paying a premium for SMS is annoying and counter to the unlimited web bandwidth; and my typing is only now to the point of pretty good. But otherwise any limitations with the built-in software are quickly becoming solved with new 3rd-party offerings, which have blossomed faster than most of us expected in no small part thanks to &#8220;Nullriver&#8217;s excellent installer&#8221;:http://iphone.nullriver.com/beta/.</p>
<p>Now the the only question is: what do I do with my &#8220;free $100&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/hotnews/openiphoneletter/?</p>

			<p>Ignore that this post is a week late. While I was out sick last week there was a great discussion across blogs about email clients, starting with &#8220;Brent Simmons&#8221;:http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3425 and then to &#8220;Paul Kafasis&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Article/Rise-of-the-OS-2007-07-05-12-00.html while passing through several good blogs in between.</p>
<p>Some of my additional gripes about Mail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text editor is terrible for text-only email, especially when quoting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI refresh glitches with mailbox unread counts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sluggish showing new smart folders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search is not powerful enough without making smart folders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall stability problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I started writing an email client last year and worked on it in my spare time for a couple of months before abandoning it. It added a few new twists that other clients don&#8217;t have, including a server component in an attempt to embrace the benefits of both Gmail (access anywhere, automatic sync) and a native Mac client (better UI). No one I described it to thought they needed it, and I gave up before the UI was polished enough to actually show. Turns out the server piece was too complex and no matter how I juggled the numbers, it just didn&#8217;t seem a profitable endeavor.</p>
<p>The recent discussions really make we want to take some of the core pieces (great performance for huge amounts of mail and a tag-based filing system), rebuild it on top of IMAP instead of my custom web services gateway, and see what happens. But I probably won&#8217;t. Email clients are a tricky thing to get right, and I don&#8217;t have time right now to make it perfect.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that there is a market waiting for a great email client. You don&#8217;t need to compete with Mail.app, you just have to appeal to anyone who has been burned by an email client before. People who are serious about email.</p>

			<p>If you are wondering why I haven&#8217;t posted here in over a month, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been getting my writing fix &#8220;over on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton, in 140 characters or less a couple times a day. Still trying to figure out the best way to integrate that experience into this site. I also have the usual queue of blog post drafts that will roll out here when I have time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile&#8230;</p>
<p>A bunch of really interesting things hit today. Microsoft Surface (can&#8217;t wait for the multi-touch iPhone); iTunes Plus (already upgraded my songs); and YouTube on the Apple TV (welcome if unexpected).</p>
<p>I have actually been dreading the iTunes Plus announcement because I am behind in &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ development, and I had hoped to coincide version 2.3 with the DRM-free AAC files on iTunes. It should be ready for a private beta in a few days. (Want in on the beta? Just email <a href="mailto:support@riverfold.com">support@riverfold.com</a>.)</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the YouTube feature that is really fascinating to me. I&#8217;ve long thought that Apple has all but given up on web video, somehow content to let Flash dominate. The Apple movie trailers site as the last pocket of QuickTime content isn&#8217;t quite good enough. Apple could have created something on the scale of YouTube but hooked into the iApps, .Mac, and built on QuickTime. Maybe even as an extension of the iTunes Store around video podcasts.</p>
<p>(The great thing about podcasts is that they are decentralized, but it makes it a little more difficult when you are trying to build a community. The iTunes Store also does a great job for discovery but nothing to help content creators. There is no one-step upload.)</p>
<p>The Apple TV announcement is weird because while on the surface it looks like a confirmation that Flash video wins, it might just be the first sign of Apple fighting back. Every video on YouTube will get the H.264 treatment. The web video revolution (of sorts) has been great, but the pieces are coming together for truly useful broadband video. Perhaps YouTube sees that they could be a major player not just for silly webcam videos but as an infrastructure for high quality distribution, with content in some categories that will rival the networks.</p>
<p>That future is especially believable the first time you sync up near-HD video podcasts to the Apple TV. It&#8217;s a great experience and definitely exceeded my expectations.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>There is a story behind the name &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/, but it&#8217;s probably not a very good one and I won&#8217;t go on a tangent by telling it here. What I will say is that I hate domain names.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I remember when domain names used to be free (I do), or maybe it&#8217;s because I get some thrill out of typing in IP addresses (I don&#8217;t), or maybe it&#8217;s because I think domains should last forever, like a printed book in wide circulation. But in any case I decided not to register WiiTransfer.com when I first named the product. Five days after announcing and shipping 1.0, someone else registered the domain, for their own presumably evil purposes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned just a handful of domains over the years. During the dot-com days I registered MyEdit.com and started building a web-based note filing system (sort of like &#8220;Stikkit&#8221;:http://stikkit.com/, but not as good). Then there were the family web site and related domains.</p>
<p>I let all of them expire, except manton.org. I kept riverfold.com for &#8220;everything else&#8221;, and I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with the simplicity of that decision right now. It was probably foolish to pass up the domain for my own product. But how many people type in photoshop.com to go anywhere? No one who matters.</p>
<p>There is a thread on the MacSB mailing list about the rise of product-oriented web sites (the &#8220;DiscoApp.com&#8221;:http://www.discoapp.com/&#8217;s of this new era of glitzy Mac shareware), and it really made me second-guess my decision to not <em>register everything</em>. But at the end of the day, it&#8217;s one less thing I have to worry about, and I can focus on stuff that is more interesting.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;Dan covers his Macworld predictions&#8221;:http://hivelogic.com/articles/2007/01/04/macworld_2007 in great detail. Instead of predictions, since mine will probably be wrong, I&#8217;m going to list what I <em>want</em> to see:</p>
<p><em>Tablet.</em> I tend to agree with &#8220;Steven Frank&#8217;s analysis&#8221;:http://stevenf.com/2007/01/wherein_i_predict_the_future.php more than &#8220;this former Apple exec&#8221;:http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1981815,00.html, but either way it remains pretty unlikely that a tablet is going to happen under Steve Job&#8217;s watch. At WWDC once Steve Jobs called the Newton a &#8220;little scribbly thing&#8221; or something similar, and it wasn&#8217;t long before he officially gave that division the axe.</p>
<p><em>Numbers.</em> Some people still insist on sending me Excel documents. We need a simple application in the iWork suite that can natively read/write Excel documents and handle the basics.</p>
<p><em>Finder.</em> I&#8217;m pretty sure Leopard will sport a new Finder, as well as user interface candy paint applied across the operating system. The only question is whether they&#8217;ve rewritten it from scratch and in the process introduced even more problems. I&#8217;m optimistic on this one, though, and expect an elegant UI evolution from the Finder team.</p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t care about:</p>
<p><em>iTV.</em> See &#8220;previous post about DRM&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/goodbye_itms.html. If I want to watch a movie, I&#8217;ll put in a DVD. However, I do hope to draw some inspiration from whatever they do and apply it to &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ development.</p>
<p><em>iPod Phone.</em> I have no doubt it will be well designed, but it will also be at least $299 (guess). I have only owned a couple mobile phones in my life, and they were free or nearly free. The iPod Phone will have to be something no one&#8217;s even thought of yet for me to consider it. It&#8217;s kind of like &#8220;Nike + iPod&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/, a luxury that I don&#8217;t really need.</p>
<p>Anyway, should be a fun Macworld. I haven&#8217;t been in years and I&#8217;m a little jealous of those who are attending this year. (But not jealous enough to want to get on a plane next week.) Part of me misses the old days, having a booth and talking with users or seeing what was new on the show floor. I was at the first Macworld keynote after Steve Jobs came back to Apple, while Gil Amelio was still in charge, and I&#8217;ll always remember it as something pretty special.</p>

								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>When we use Google everyday and mostly work with technology and related topics that are well indexed, it&#8217;s easy to forget the truth: the web is horribly incomplete. I&#8217;ve been doing some research for an upcoming podcast and it&#8217;s very frustrating to encounter huge gaping voids in the internet where history, audio recordings, and photographs should be. Somewhere out there is an audio cassette tape recording that I&#8217;d like to hear, but it will probably gather dust in an attic for the next decade instead. It needs to be even easier for anyone to put everything they have online so that it can be preserved and shared. Already I think the current generation raised on instant messaging and the web may not realize that there&#8217;s a whole world out there that is outside the reach of our keyboards. At least I know I sometimes forget.</p>
<p>The other part of the problem is linkrot. And not just 404s, but old links to obsolete file formats that can no longer be accessed. I can&#8217;t even count how many links to .ram files I&#8217;ve clicked that result in an error. When your content requires a special server (RealAudio streaming server software, in this case), it&#8217;s only a matter of time before that content itself will die.</p>
<p>Now, the good news is that a simple MP3 file and static HTML file with JPEG images will be around forever. It requires no special server software, no dynamic processing of any kind, and client software is so widespread and open that it&#8217;s a guarantee you can access it 10 years later. The only missing piece of the puzzle is reliable non-expiring domain registration and hosting.</p>
<p>The bad news is the rise of centralized web applications and data stores. What happens when YouTube shuts down? Remember they burn through huge amounts of cash for bandwidth each month and seem to have few options for becoming profitable. I feel better about Flickr, because they <em>get it</em>, but &#8220;Yahoo! has been known&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2002/07/yahoo_mail.html to not treat data longevity seriously.</p>

			<p><img src="../../../images/2006/airport_man.jpg" width="143" height="296" alt="Airport sketch" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /> I attended &#8220;RailsConf&#8221;:http://www.railsconf.org/ in Chicago last month. There&#8217;s a lot of excitement in the Rails community right now, and it was nice to be there for the first year before it explodes to the even bigger event that the conference will be next year when O&#8217;Reilly takes over.</p>
<p>The talks were a mix of great to just okay. &#8220;Damon Clinkscales&#8221;:http://www.damonclinkscales.com/ provided a solid introduction to migrations, and even though he had previewed the talk for me the night before I still picked up some useful tips. I was finally able to hear first hand what a fantastic speaker &#8220;Mike Clark&#8221;:http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom is. James Duncan Davidson rounded out the weekend with a high-level &#8220;vision for deployments&#8221;:http://duncandavidson.com/essay/2006/06/webaspipe/. I also enjoyed presentations by &#8220;Paul Graham&#8221;:http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html, the music and brilliance of &#8220;Why&#8221;:http://redhanded.hobix.com/, the closing Rails core team panel, and of course &#8220;DHH on REST and embracing CRUD&#8221;:http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000593.html. One of the nice things about open source is that soon after announcing the new ActiveResource framework, David checked in his code so you can immediately see &#8220;what he has been working on&#8221;:http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk/activeresource/ and play along.</p>
<p>As I look back on the schedule, there were many talks I missed completely, so I&#8217;m looking forward to catching the audio or video of some of those. Still, you could get a lot out of the conference just by talking to people between or during sessions.</p>
<p>While at the Austin airport, I filled a sketchbook page with random people waiting for the delayed flight. This man on the right was leaning against an abandoned ticket counter.</p>

			<p>I love reading about the setup for other Mac users: what kind of desks, computers, and software they use. The full list of applications usually overlaps quite a bit with my own Dock, but every once in a while there is some new app that I am not using, but should be. And there are always the two killer apps that provide the most insight into how a user works: email and text.</p>
<p>Are they a long-time Mac user who can&#8217;t live without BBEdit? Do they use Mail.app but secretly wish that it was better?</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan starts off his post&#8221;:http://hivelogic.com/articles/2006/04/17/setup_part_ii with TextMate, which has quickly taken over the Mac Rails community. Despite a rocky 1.0, I gave TextMate a second try with 1.5 and have enjoyed using it. There is some very powerful stuff in it, some of which never clicked for me until I watched &#8220;this screencast of snippets in action&#8221;:http://macromates.com/screencast/scopes_and_comments.mov.</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t use TextMate for everything. There are three text editors always running on my machine, and I don&#8217;t see that changing anytime soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>TextMate: My new default for general-purpose editing, and Ruby on Rails projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xcode: Needed for C++ and Objective-C because of the integration with the debugger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BBEdit: Great for batch grep processing and multiple-file diff.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On a whim a few nights ago I tried to use TextMate for editing even C++ and Objective-C. It&#8217;s trivial enough to configure Xcode to use TextMate as its default editor (in Xcode, look under Preferences &#8594; File Types), and I was happily surprised that you can even run builds from within TextMate out of the box. If you have a TextMate project in the same directory as your Xcode project, the build will just work. If not, you can manually point TextMate to your Xcode project by clicking the &#8220;i&#8221; icon in the drawer when no files are selected, then add the shell variable TM_XCODE_PROJECT that points to a full path to your project.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I could only keep this setup for one night before I had to abandon it. Without breakpoint support or any integration with the debugger (impossible), it breaks the workflow cycle of testing and fixing bugs quickly.</p>

			<p><img src="../../../images/2006/bunny.jpg" border="0" height="185" width="150" alt="Silly bunny" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10" title="Quick sketch and Photoshop color" /> Easter is a time of rebirth and starting over. So today I&#8217;m flipping over two new things.</p>
<p>The first, to fulfill a <a href="../../../2006/01/new_year.html">new year&#8217;s resolution</a> that died before February. I rearranged my office and drawing desk yesterday to make everything more accessible, and I was doodling last night when this silly little bunny sketch came out. I have a few more drawings and pieces of animation in various states of completion that I&#8217;d like to post too, but I&#8217;m not going to let the backlog of &#8220;finishing&#8221; anything stop me from posting now on a weekly basis. Really.</p>
<p>Secondly, I made a long-overdue server change this weekend. About a year ago I gave up self-hosting on an old Linux box and moved this site and email to <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a>. I had high hopes. It was run by smart people with good ideas, and it was officially endorsed by the Ruby on Rails project.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the server I was hosted on (Bidwell) was down much too frequently. I couldn&#8217;t help comparing it to the near-flawless uptime I had running my own box on a static DSL address. Lots of little problems and broken promises added to the overall frustration. And running underneath the whole mess was an undercurrent of unprofessionalism. I gave them a year to sort it out and it never got better.</p>
<p>Which is too bad, because there was a lot of potential there. I still wish them good luck, and especially to the Joyent team as well.</p>
<p>Today my site is live on <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?175378">DreamHost</a>. I&#8217;ve had mostly good experiences using DreamHost to manage the <a href="http://www.staple-austin.org/">STAPLE! web site</a> in the last two years. Here&#8217;s hoping I won&#8217;t have to switch again anytime soon.</p>

			<p>Even before I arrived in San Francisco, and even before the rumors surfaced of Apple switching to Intel, this WWDC looked to be a unique one. For the first time since I can remember, the conference was mostly going to cover a shipping OS. Steve Jobs mentioned Leopard only in that we would hear about it more next year.</p>
<p>On the BART from the airport I met some fellow WWDC attendees (the Apple and Mac-hack 1995 t-shirts were an easy giveaway). We discussed the ramifications of Intel, what else might be in store. I still hoped for a new product line, maybe a tablet or something interesting and different as the first step to Intel.</p>
<p>And then everything changed, the rumors were true. It was a bold move, but as Steve Jobs said, Apple is strong right now. They know what they have to do to pull this transition off.</p>

			<p>We all use web apps. Google Maps or Mapquest, Yahoo! Mail or Hotmail, Basecamp and FogBugz. The ubiquity of these services has reached the point where it is increasingly useful to point to them from other applications, web or native. Mac OS X&rsquo;s Address Book and Dashboard Yellow Pages both point to Mapquest.</p>
<p>Mac OS X Hints has a <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050424065456133">hack to point Dashboard at Google Maps</a> instead, but what I&rsquo;d really like is system-wide settings for important classes of web applications. My default search engine, maps, or photo management apps could all benefit from this.</p>
<p>Sadly, even on the desktop &mdash; where native apps can easily register for protocol handlers and play nice with others &mdash; the situation is often closed. The &ldquo;Lookup in Dictionary&rdquo; command in Tiger&rsquo;s Safari is hard-coded to Dictionary.app, instead of checking what other app might have registered to handle dict:/// URLs. If dict:/// was replaced by http://www.dictionary.com/, it becomes even more extensible. But in Tiger, third-party developers who have a great dictionary application or web site are obsoleted without a user choice.</p>
<p>This problem will only become more exagerated over time. Every app that could potentially exchange data, whether web-based or not, should have an integration story. If the OS doesn&rsquo;t want to help this effort, perhaps an open framework in the spirit of the original Internet Config can fill the need.</p>

			<p>The other day I went for a walk and on the way back picked up a candy wrapper on the sidewalk, to throw away when I got home. If I pick up other people&rsquo;s trash (not a frequent activity, but not that uncommon either), I don&rsquo;t expect a thank-you or for anyone to notice. But this time I did receive a thanks, of sorts.</p>
<p>I opened our outside garbage can and staring at me from the bottom was a pile of cables and an original WebTV. I had bought the WebTV years ago. The reasons given for this strange purchase ranged from &ldquo;browsing the web in your living room is neat&rdquo; to &ldquo;it&rsquo;s for my mom&rdquo; (she didn&rsquo;t end up liking it). The ancient and mostly-useless device almost made it into one of our garage sales, on Traci&rsquo;s request, but I&rsquo;d always feel guilty even trying to sell it. It was obvious she had thrown it away, giving up on me and my often unreasonable tendency to <i>keep everything</i>.</p>
<p>Rummaging through the technology junk, I salvaged a Firewire cable, audio/video cables, a power cable, and a Laserdisc remote control. It felt good to finally close the lid on the WebTV. Who knows, maybe the Laserdisc will be next.</p>

			<p>We should all be weary of new acronyms lest we promote and give significance to half-baked ideas and fads. But Jesse James Garrett&#8217;s <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">Ajax essay</a> is a good read &#8212; a concise, high-level look at how JavaScript and XML will upgrade the web browser for fast, dynamic web applications.</p>
<p>Perhaps purposefully, he leaves out the role (if any) of HTML + Flash applications, which Macromedia has been promoting for some time as Rich Internet Applications. It is essentially the same concept, but basing your app on HTML, JavaScript, and XML can solve the major problems of Flash-based apps. Flickr, for example, integrates Flash, not DHTML or Ajax. Don&#8217;t misunderstand me, I think Flash-based web apps negate the benefits of the web infrastructure, such as good REST design, but a thorough analysis of asynchronous interactive web apps needs to include Flash at some level.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Veen mentions the <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000689.html">significance to Flash apps</a>, and Matthew Haughey covers the <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/02/ajax_on_the_ris.html">KnowNow connection</a>.</p>
<p>Another new Ajax site is the <a href="http://www.panic.com/goods/">Panic t-shirt store</a>. How many web apps use drag-and-drop at all, let alone so effectively? It&#8217;s so simple and elegant, by the time you get to the checkout page and see yet-another-web-form, the change is almost jarring.</p>
<p>The interesting thing will be whether the web standards folks embrace Ajax. You won&#8217;t find a spec for XmlHttpRequest at the W3C. Look at the Google source, and you&#8217;ll probably see conditions for Firefox or Internet Explorer (Safari isn&#8217;t even supported). But Ajax has something going for it: it brings some of the power of native apps to the web, but unlike the old promise of Java or even Flash, it&#8217;s zero-install and quick-load. We&#8217;ve got to drop this &#8220;web standards&#8221; holy war and just get on with building next generation apps.</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t an acronym when embedded images and HTML tables hit the web. The web just changed, seemingly overnight. The same thing will happen with more interactive, less page-driven applications. It&#8217;s just the new web.</p>

			<p>Google Desktop Search is a neat app. The integration of local and global results is brilliant. But it&#8217;s not the future of desktop search.</p>
<p>David Galbraith said something interesting in a post titled <a href="http://www.davidgalbraith.org/archives/000674.html">&#8220;Google lock in&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Whatever Microsoft do, Google have shown the way forward, their desktop search makes your desktop just one more search tab. It brings your desktop to the web rather than the web to the desktop and this seems like a much more logical UI experience.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe. I&#8217;m not sure I totally disagree with that point, given Google&#8217;s dominance of web search. But one thing I do believe is that a native application user interface always has the <i>potential</i> to be better than a web-based one. If you buy into that opinion, it means that we aren&#8217;t done. In fact, it means Google&#8217;s monopoly as it currently exists is vulnerable.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a step back. In general, there were three things that allowed web-based apps to win out in the late 90s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of development. Building interfaces in HTML is fast and very flexible.</li>
<li>Speed and storage. Fast databases, lots of memory, and load-balanced web servers.</li>
<li>Cross-platform. New companies put their resources on web-based apps instead of traditional ones. (Also see Joel Spolsky&#8217;s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">&#8220;How Microsoft Lost the API War&#8221;</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Native apps can&#8217;t compete on those points. Instead, they can win with thoughtful interfaces constructed to fit on the platform alongside other native apps. As an example, lately I&#8217;ve been using Ranchero Software&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> for weblog writing, and it&#8217;s a huge step forward from the Movable Type web interface. And that&#8217;s not because the Movable Type interface is particularly bad (it&#8217;s actually slightly above average). It&#8217;s just that a web-based app, even running locally, is a black box that cannot play nice with the rest of the system.</p>
<p>Tim O&#8217;Reilly likes to talk about how little apps such as Apple&#8217;s Address Book and iChat provide base features that other apps can build upon (a Friendster-like social app should hook into your buddy list). That kind of integration is difficult with web-based apps because user data tends to be stored locally, and if published to the web, it could be to one of any number of services. Instead of two platforms (Mac OS X and Windows), you may have dozens of individual web-based platforms (Yahoo!, MSN, AOL, Friendster, Mapquest, Fandango, and more). Those services are designed to take your data and keep it; there is not likely to be a standard API to share information between them anytime soon.</p>
<p>The potential of a native app is even stronger in this era of web services. Web developers are going back to their roots, building REST design into their applications from the ground app instead of exposing complex SOAP calls on the top as an afterthought. A recent example of this is Del.icio.us, it&#8217;s API, and the still-evolving <a href="http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/">Cocoalicious</a> client, which already has hooks from PulpFiction and NetNewsWire. Another example is <a href="http://1001.kung-foo.tv/">1001</a>, a Flickr client.</p>
<p>To bring this back to search, Google rose to the top because they were fast, accurate, and valued the user enough to know when to get out of his or her way. Google is still all of those things, because they had unique leadership that recognized those strengths from the very beginning.</p>
<p>So why, especially given Google&#8217;s strong brand, are there still new competitors investing in search? Because there is room for improvement. Users will move to new applications for the same reason they moved to the iPod: <i>it was that much better</i>. <a href="http://www.snap.com/">Snap</a> adds sorting, for example. <a href="http://www.teoma.com/">Teoma</a> added a refine feature.</p>
<p>But unfortunately for the competition, they are trying to do things that are simply best left for outside the browser. Gmail was widely acknowledged as a breakthrough app that could hold it&#8217;s own against native email apps, but that&#8217;s only because native email apps are so notoriously bad. With the limited number of emails most people have, the &#8220;speed and storage&#8221; advantage of most web applications was not a critical factor.</p>
<p>Enter Apple&#8217;s spotlight technology. It integrates with the Finder or any application that wants to play. It&#8217;s extensible by third-party developers to accommodate file types that Apple does not support out of the box (this was a quick complaint from Dave Winer about Google Desktop Search). It has a fast, polished user interface that is built around finding local files and dealing with their metadata in an appropriate way. It&#8217;s just better.</p>
<p>This won&#8217;t be the first time Apple has stepped into search and metadata (remember <a href="http://www.guha.com/">R.V. Guha&#8217;s</a> MCF and the HotSauce fly-through browser? Remember Sherlock?). But it will be the first time it&#8217;s really clicked in the UI.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$9217">Wes Felter said</a>: &#8220;If I just had the Web browser UI I would feel totally crippled.&#8221;</p>
<p>And at some level, Google gets this fully. Take for example their <a href="http://www.picasa.com/">Picasa photo application</a>. Or the Google Deskbar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=efbd2aa3-a713-4bda-bb09-183b91cb9b7a">Don park sees the problem</a> in terms of metadata and less about user interface:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The core problem here is that search engines like Google throws everything into one pot.&#160; For web search, all the web pages on the Net gets thrown into that pot.&#160; Thankfully, hyperlink-based pageranking pulls the good stuff to surface with minimal hassle.&#160; With desktop search, all of your documents gets thrown into the pot without an equivalent of page ranking to measure relevance.&#160; IMHO, there aren&#8217;t enough metadata on the desktop to achieve the same level of utility Google web search offers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>More to the point, Dan Wood commented on the <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX/WatsonStatus.html">accidental integration between Watson and Delicious Library</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In fact, I recently read that Watson&#8217;s Amazon.com tool integrates quite nicely with Delicious Library via drag and drop. A lot of this has to do with the support we had put into Watson for integrating with other applications, including your browser and Spring. If Delicious Library hooks up with PriceGrabber, we may find similar compatibility between the two applications as well, either through luck or through design.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Two simple things made this possible: Apple providing a recommendation for how drag-and-drop of URLs should work, and the REST-style URLs of a traditional web app like Amazon.</p>
<p>A final conclusion, to a post that&#8217;s already too long. <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">Newsfire</a> is a lightweight news reader with a clean interface that is a <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2004/11/3.html">hybrid of native controls and HTML</a>, backed by useful metadata (RSS). And <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> is more than a book catalog app, it&#8217;s an Amazon UI stripped to just the essentials. Both these applications are at the peak of a shift that has been a couple years in the making &#8212; the convergence of web services, post-iTunes UI design, and system services such as Address Book, drag-and-drop, and metadata. Future apps will be judged by these standards.</p>

			<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/italk/">Griffin iTalk</a> earlier this week. Not entirely an impulse buy, but I did drive over to the local Apple Store instead of ordering online. I&rsquo;ve been wanting the ability to record on my iPod since I received my first generation one. I find myself walking and driving a lot lately, so it&rsquo;s a great way to record random thoughts while away from the computer. For personal use, not for broadcasting.</p>
<p>The quality is acceptable, but not what I&rsquo;d like it to be. I tried to record a lecture in a large auditorium, with poor results. Might try again with a better position, or even an external microphone.</p>
<p>The software interface is the expected Apple high standards. Plug the thing in and it works, nothing to install. Yes, that&rsquo;s right &mdash; Apple built recording software into all iPods (except the minis), knowing that only a very small fraction would have the hardware necessary to record. And that philosophy comes from the top. Here&rsquo;s what Steve had to say in an <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/oct2004/nf20041012_4018_db083.htm">interview with BusinessWeek</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because when you buy our products, and three months later you get stuck on something, you quickly figure out [how to get past it]. And you think, &lsquo;Wow, someone over there at Apple actually thought of this!&rsquo; And then three months later you try to do something you hadn&rsquo;t tried before, and it works, and you think &lsquo;Hey, they thought of that, too.&rsquo; And then six months later it happens again. There&rsquo;s almost no product in the world that you have that experience with, but you have it with a Mac. And you have it with an iPod.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Jon Udell frequently talks about audio techniques. I liked this section from today&rsquo;s blog post on <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/10/14.html#a1095">personal productivity</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How many times have you heard this? &lsquo;Your call may be recorded in order to assure quality customer service.&rsquo; Lately I&rsquo;m starting to repeat the line back to them and then start recording on my end too. If you can pinpoint what an agent said on a previous call, you can alter the balance of power.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I bought a new gadget for myself. We&rsquo;ll have to see whether it ends up being useful or not.</p>

			<p>Wired News will <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64596,00.html">no longer capitalize internet, web, or net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But in the case of internet, web and net, a change in our house style was necessary to put into perspective what the internet is: another medium for delivering and receiving information. That it transformed human communication is beyond dispute. But no more so than moveable type did in its day. Or the radio. Or television.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a good thing. Years ago, I remember arguing quite passionately with People Who Had Some Kind of Related College Degree that &#8220;web&#8221; should not be capitalized. I lost that battle, and have since occasionally capitalized it myself, for conformity&#8217;s sake.</p>
