			<p><img src="../../../images/2006/airport_man.jpg" width="143" height="296" alt="Airport sketch" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /> I attended &#8220;RailsConf&#8221;:http://www.railsconf.org/ in Chicago last month. There&#8217;s a lot of excitement in the Rails community right now, and it was nice to be there for the first year before it explodes to the even bigger event that the conference will be next year when O&#8217;Reilly takes over.</p>
<p>The talks were a mix of great to just okay. &#8220;Damon Clinkscales&#8221;:http://www.damonclinkscales.com/ provided a solid introduction to migrations, and even though he had previewed the talk for me the night before I still picked up some useful tips. I was finally able to hear first hand what a fantastic speaker &#8220;Mike Clark&#8221;:http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom is. James Duncan Davidson rounded out the weekend with a high-level &#8220;vision for deployments&#8221;:http://duncandavidson.com/essay/2006/06/webaspipe/. I also enjoyed presentations by &#8220;Paul Graham&#8221;:http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html, the music and brilliance of &#8220;Why&#8221;:http://redhanded.hobix.com/, the closing Rails core team panel, and of course &#8220;DHH on REST and embracing CRUD&#8221;:http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000593.html. One of the nice things about open source is that soon after announcing the new ActiveResource framework, David checked in his code so you can immediately see &#8220;what he has been working on&#8221;:http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk/activeresource/ and play along.</p>
<p>As I look back on the schedule, there were many talks I missed completely, so I&#8217;m looking forward to catching the audio or video of some of those. Still, you could get a lot out of the conference just by talking to people between or during sessions.</p>
<p>While at the Austin airport, I filled a sketchbook page with random people waiting for the delayed flight. This man on the right was leaning against an abandoned ticket counter.</p>

			<p>I love reading about the setup for other Mac users: what kind of desks, computers, and software they use. The full list of applications usually overlaps quite a bit with my own Dock, but every once in a while there is some new app that I am not using, but should be. And there are always the two killer apps that provide the most insight into how a user works: email and text.</p>
<p>Are they a long-time Mac user who can&#8217;t live without BBEdit? Do they use Mail.app but secretly wish that it was better?</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan starts off his post&#8221;:http://hivelogic.com/articles/2006/04/17/setup_part_ii with TextMate, which has quickly taken over the Mac Rails community. Despite a rocky 1.0, I gave TextMate a second try with 1.5 and have enjoyed using it. There is some very powerful stuff in it, some of which never clicked for me until I watched &#8220;this screencast of snippets in action&#8221;:http://macromates.com/screencast/scopes_and_comments.mov.</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t use TextMate for everything. There are three text editors always running on my machine, and I don&#8217;t see that changing anytime soon:</p>
<ul>
<li>TextMate: My new default for general-purpose editing, and Ruby on Rails projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Xcode: Needed for C++ and Objective-C because of the integration with the debugger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BBEdit: Great for batch grep processing and multiple-file diff.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On a whim a few nights ago I tried to use TextMate for editing even C++ and Objective-C. It&#8217;s trivial enough to configure Xcode to use TextMate as its default editor (in Xcode, look under Preferences &#8594; File Types), and I was happily surprised that you can even run builds from within TextMate out of the box. If you have a TextMate project in the same directory as your Xcode project, the build will just work. If not, you can manually point TextMate to your Xcode project by clicking the &#8220;i&#8221; icon in the drawer when no files are selected, then add the shell variable TM_XCODE_PROJECT that points to a full path to your project.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I could only keep this setup for one night before I had to abandon it. Without breakpoint support or any integration with the debugger (impossible), it breaks the workflow cycle of testing and fixing bugs quickly.</p>

<p>The first, to fulfill a <a href="../../../2006/01/new_year.html">new year&#8217;s resolution</a> that died before February. I rearranged my office and drawing desk yesterday to make everything more accessible, and I was doodling last night when this silly little bunny sketch came out. I have a few more drawings and pieces of animation in various states of completion that I&#8217;d like to post too, but I&#8217;m not going to let the backlog of &#8220;finishing&#8221; anything stop me from posting now on a weekly basis. Really.</p>
<p>Secondly, I made a long-overdue server change this weekend. About a year ago I gave up self-hosting on an old Linux box and moved this site and email to <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a>. I had high hopes. It was run by smart people with good ideas, and it was officially endorsed by the Ruby on Rails project.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the server I was hosted on (Bidwell) was down much too frequently. I couldn&#8217;t help comparing it to the near-flawless uptime I had running my own box on a static DSL address. Lots of little problems and broken promises added to the overall frustration. And running underneath the whole mess was an undercurrent of unprofessionalism. I gave them a year to sort it out and it never got better.</p>
<p>Which is too bad, because there was a lot of potential there. I still wish them good luck, and especially to the Joyent team as well.</p>
<p>Today my site is live on <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?175378">DreamHost</a>. I&#8217;ve had mostly good experiences using DreamHost to manage the <a href="http://www.staple-austin.org/">STAPLE! web site</a> in the last two years. Here&#8217;s hoping I won&#8217;t have to switch again anytime soon.</p>
<p>(Want to try DreamHost? Use coupon code MANTON40 to get $40 off.)</p>

			<p>Even before I arrived in San Francisco, and even before the rumors surfaced of Apple switching to Intel, this WWDC looked to be a unique one. For the first time since I can remember, the conference was mostly going to cover a shipping OS. Steve Jobs mentioned Leopard only in that we would hear about it more next year.</p>
<p>On the BART from the airport I met some fellow WWDC attendees (the Apple and Mac-hack 1995 t-shirts were an easy giveaway). We discussed the ramifications of Intel, what else might be in store. I still hoped for a new product line, maybe a tablet or something interesting and different as the first step to Intel.</p>
<p>And then everything changed, the rumors were true. It was a bold move, but as Steve Jobs said, Apple is strong right now. They know what they have to do to pull this transition off.</p>

			<p>We all use web apps. Google Maps or Mapquest, Yahoo! Mail or Hotmail, Basecamp and FogBugz. The ubiquity of these services has reached the point where it is increasingly useful to point to them from other applications, web or native. Mac OS X&rsquo;s Address Book and Dashboard Yellow Pages both point to Mapquest.</p>
<p>Mac OS X Hints has a <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050424065456133">hack to point Dashboard at Google Maps</a> instead, but what I&rsquo;d really like is system-wide settings for important classes of web applications. My default search engine, maps, or photo management apps could all benefit from this.</p>
<p>Sadly, even on the desktop &mdash; where native apps can easily register for protocol handlers and play nice with others &mdash; the situation is often closed. The &ldquo;Lookup in Dictionary&rdquo; command in Tiger&rsquo;s Safari is hard-coded to Dictionary.app, instead of checking what other app might have registered to handle dict:/// URLs. If dict:/// was replaced by http://www.dictionary.com/, it becomes even more extensible. But in Tiger, third-party developers who have a great dictionary application or web site are obsoleted without a user choice.</p>
<p>This problem will only become more exagerated over time. Every app that could potentially exchange data, whether web-based or not, should have an integration story. If the OS doesn&rsquo;t want to help this effort, perhaps an open framework in the spirit of the original Internet Config can fill the need.</p>

			<p>The other day I went for a walk and on the way back picked up a candy wrapper on the sidewalk, to throw away when I got home. If I pick up other people&rsquo;s trash (not a frequent activity, but not that uncommon either), I don&rsquo;t expect a thank-you or for anyone to notice. But this time I did receive a thanks, of sorts.</p>
<p>I opened our outside garbage can and staring at me from the bottom was a pile of cables and an original WebTV. I had bought the WebTV years ago. The reasons given for this strange purchase ranged from &ldquo;browsing the web in your living room is neat&rdquo; to &ldquo;it&rsquo;s for my mom&rdquo; (she didn&rsquo;t end up liking it). The ancient and mostly-useless device almost made it into one of our garage sales, on Traci&rsquo;s request, but I&rsquo;d always feel guilty even trying to sell it. It was obvious she had thrown it away, giving up on me and my often unreasonable tendency to <i>keep everything</i>.</p>
<p>Rummaging through the technology junk, I salvaged a Firewire cable, audio/video cables, a power cable, and a Laserdisc remote control. It felt good to finally close the lid on the WebTV. Who knows, maybe the Laserdisc will be next.</p>

It is essentially the same concept, but basing your app on HTML, JavaScript, and XML can solve the major problems of Flash-based apps. Flickr, for example, integrates Flash, not DHTML or Ajax. Don&#8217;t misunderstand me, I think Flash-based web apps negate the benefits of the web infrastructure, such as good REST design, but a thorough analysis of asynchronous interactive web apps needs to include Flash at some level.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Veen mentions the <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000689.html">significance to Flash apps</a>, and Matthew Haughey covers the <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2005/02/ajax_on_the_ris.html">KnowNow connection</a>.</p>
<p>Another new Ajax site is the <a href="http://www.panic.com/goods/">Panic t-shirt store</a>. How many web apps use drag-and-drop at all, let alone so effectively? It&#8217;s so simple and elegant, by the time you get to the checkout page and see yet-another-web-form, the change is almost jarring.</p>
<p>The interesting thing will be whether the web standards folks embrace Ajax. You won&#8217;t find a spec for XmlHttpRequest at the W3C. Look at the Google source, and you&#8217;ll probably see conditions for Firefox or Internet Explorer (Safari isn&#8217;t even supported). But Ajax has something going for it: it brings some of the power of native apps to the web, but unlike the old promise of Java or even Flash, it&#8217;s zero-install and quick-load. We&#8217;ve got to drop this &#8220;web standards&#8221; holy war and just get on with building next generation apps.</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t an acronym when embedded images and HTML tables hit the web. The web just changed, seemingly overnight. The same thing will happen with more interactive, less page-driven applications. It&#8217;s just the new web.</p>

			<p>Google Desktop Search is a neat app. The integration of local and global results is brilliant. But it&#8217;s not the future of desktop search.</p>
<p>David Galbraith said something interesting in a post titled <a href="http://www.davidgalbraith.org/archives/000674.html">&#8220;Google lock in&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Whatever Microsoft do, Google have shown the way forward, their desktop search makes your desktop just one more search tab. It brings your desktop to the web rather than the web to the desktop and this seems like a much more logical UI experience.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe. I&#8217;m not sure I totally disagree with that point, given Google&#8217;s dominance of web search. But one thing I do believe is that a native application user interface always has the <i>potential</i> to be better than a web-based one. If you buy into that opinion, it means that we aren&#8217;t done. In fact, it means Google&#8217;s monopoly as it currently exists is vulnerable.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a step back. In general, there were three things that allowed web-based apps to win out in the late 90s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of development. Building interfaces in HTML is fast and very flexible.</li>
<li>Speed and storage. Fast databases, lots of memory, and load-balanced web servers.</li>
<li>Cross-platform. New companies put their resources on web-based apps instead of traditional ones. (Also see Joel Spolsky&#8217;s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">&#8220;How Microsoft Lost the API War&#8221;</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Native apps can&#8217;t compete on those points. Instead, they can win with thoughtful interfaces constructed to fit on the platform alongside other native apps. As an example, lately I&#8217;ve been using Ranchero Software&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> for weblog writing, and it&#8217;s a huge step forward from the Movable Type web interface. And that&#8217;s not because the Movable Type interface is particularly bad (it&#8217;s actually slightly above average). It&#8217;s just that a web-based app, even running locally, is a black box that cannot play nice with the rest of the system.</p>
<p>Tim O&#8217;Reilly likes to talk about how little apps such as Apple&#8217;s Address Book and iChat provide base features that other apps can build upon (a Friendster-like social app should hook into your buddy list). That kind of integration is difficult with web-based apps because user data tends to be stored locally, and if published to the web, it could be to one of any number of services. Instead of two platforms (Mac OS X and Windows), you may have dozens of individual web-based platforms (Yahoo!, MSN, AOL, Friendster, Mapquest, Fandango, and more). Those services are designed to take your data and keep it; there is not likely to be a standard API to share information between them anytime soon.</p>
<p>The potential of a native app is even stronger in this era of web services. Web developers are going back to their roots, building REST design into their applications from the ground app instead of exposing complex SOAP calls on the top as an afterthought. A recent example of this is Del.icio.us, it&#8217;s API, and the still-evolving <a href="http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/">Cocoalicious</a> client, which already has hooks from PulpFiction and NetNewsWire. Another example is <a href="http://1001.kung-foo.tv/">1001</a>, a Flickr client.</p>
<p>To bring this back to search, Google rose to the top because they were fast, accurate, and valued the user enough to know when to get out of his or her way. Google is still all of those things, because they had unique leadership that recognized those strengths from the very beginning.</p>
<p>So why, especially given Google&#8217;s strong brand, are there still new competitors investing in search? Because there is room for improvement. Users will move to new applications for the same reason they moved to the iPod: <i>it was that much better</i>. <a href="http://www.snap.com/">Snap</a> adds sorting, for example. <a href="http://www.teoma.com/">Teoma</a> added a refine feature.</p>
<p>But unfortunately for the competition, they are trying to do things that are simply best left for outside the browser. Gmail was widely acknowledged as a breakthrough app that could hold it&#8217;s own against native email apps, but that&#8217;s only because native email apps are so notoriously bad. With the limited number of emails most people have, the &#8220;speed and storage&#8221; advantage of most web applications was not a critical factor.</p>
<p>Enter Apple&#8217;s spotlight technology. It integrates with the Finder or any application that wants to play. It&#8217;s extensible by third-party developers to accommodate file types that Apple does not support out of the box (this was a quick complaint from Dave Winer about Google Desktop Search). It has a fast, polished user interface that is built around finding local files and dealing with their metadata in an appropriate way. It&#8217;s just better.</p>
<p>This won&#8217;t be the first time Apple has stepped into search and metadata (remember <a href="http://www.guha.com/">R.V. Guha&#8217;s</a> MCF and the HotSauce fly-through browser? Remember Sherlock?). But it will be the first time it&#8217;s really clicked in the UI.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$9217">Wes Felter said</a>: &#8220;If I just had the Web browser UI I would feel totally crippled.&#8221;</p>
<p>And at some level, Google gets this fully. Take for example their <a href="http://www.picasa.com/">Picasa photo application</a>. Or the Google Deskbar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=efbd2aa3-a713-4bda-bb09-183b91cb9b7a">Don park sees the problem</a> in terms of metadata and less about user interface:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The core problem here is that search engines like Google throws everything into one pot.&#160; For web search, all the web pages on the Net gets thrown into that pot.&#160; Thankfully, hyperlink-based pageranking pulls the good stuff to surface with minimal hassle.&#160; With desktop search, all of your documents gets thrown into the pot without an equivalent of page ranking to measure relevance.&#160; IMHO, there aren&#8217;t enough metadata on the desktop to achieve the same level of utility Google web search offers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>More to the point, Dan Wood commented on the <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX/WatsonStatus.html">accidental integration between Watson and Delicious Library</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In fact, I recently read that Watson&#8217;s Amazon.com tool integrates quite nicely with Delicious Library via drag and drop. A lot of this has to do with the support we had put into Watson for integrating with other applications, including your browser and Spring. If Delicious Library hooks up with PriceGrabber, we may find similar compatibility between the two applications as well, either through luck or through design.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Two simple things made this possible: Apple providing a recommendation for how drag-and-drop of URLs should work, and the REST-style URLs of a traditional web app like Amazon.</p>
<p>A final conclusion, to a post that&#8217;s already too long. <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">Newsfire</a> is a lightweight news reader with a clean interface that is a <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2004/11/3.html">hybrid of native controls and HTML</a>, backed by useful metadata (RSS). And <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> is more than a book catalog app, it&#8217;s an Amazon UI stripped to just the essentials. Both these applications are at the peak of a shift that has been a couple years in the making &#8212; the convergence of web services, post-iTunes UI design, and system services such as Address Book, drag-and-drop, and metadata. Future apps will be judged by these standards.</p>

			<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/italk/">Griffin iTalk</a> earlier this week. Not entirely an impulse buy, but I did drive over to the local Apple Store instead of ordering online. I&rsquo;ve been wanting the ability to record on my iPod since I received my first generation one. I find myself walking and driving a lot lately, so it&rsquo;s a great way to record random thoughts while away from the computer. For personal use, not for broadcasting.</p>
<p>The quality is acceptable, but not what I&rsquo;d like it to be. I tried to record a lecture in a large auditorium, with poor results. Might try again with a better position, or even an external microphone.</p>
<p>The software interface is the expected Apple high standards. Plug the thing in and it works, nothing to install. Yes, that&rsquo;s right &mdash; Apple built recording software into all iPods (except the minis), knowing that only a very small fraction would have the hardware necessary to record. And that philosophy comes from the top. Here&rsquo;s what Steve had to say in an <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/oct2004/nf20041012_4018_db083.htm">interview with BusinessWeek</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because when you buy our products, and three months later you get stuck on something, you quickly figure out [how to get past it]. And you think, &lsquo;Wow, someone over there at Apple actually thought of this!&rsquo; And then three months later you try to do something you hadn&rsquo;t tried before, and it works, and you think &lsquo;Hey, they thought of that, too.&rsquo; And then six months later it happens again. There&rsquo;s almost no product in the world that you have that experience with, but you have it with a Mac. And you have it with an iPod.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Jon Udell frequently talks about audio techniques. I liked this section from today&rsquo;s blog post on <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/10/14.html#a1095">personal productivity</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How many times have you heard this? &lsquo;Your call may be recorded in order to assure quality customer service.&rsquo; Lately I&rsquo;m starting to repeat the line back to them and then start recording on my end too. If you can pinpoint what an agent said on a previous call, you can alter the balance of power.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I bought a new gadget for myself. We&rsquo;ll have to see whether it ends up being useful or not.</p>

			<p>Wired News will <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64596,00.html">no longer capitalize internet, web, or net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But in the case of internet, web and net, a change in our house style was necessary to put into perspective what the internet is: another medium for delivering and receiving information.

<p>This is a good thing. Years ago, I remember arguing quite passionately with People Who Had Some Kind of Related College Degree that &#8220;web&#8221; should not be capitalized. I lost that battle, and have since occasionally capitalized it myself, for conformity&#8217;s sake.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s no secret that iTunes is one of Apple&#8217;s best apps. Of all the iApps, iTunes remains the only one I have no critical feature requests for. With version 4.5, Apple adds to what was already a solid app, and they continue to do so in a way that fits well inside the two foundation pieces they&#8217;ve created: the basic music library interface and the iTunes Music Store.</p>
<p>I noticed the other day that they now have trailers and music videos inside of iTunes. The investment they made in the old <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/">trailers site</a> was initially just to showcase QuickTime, but it ties perfectly in with the store soundtrack collection.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next? Here are some more random ideas for the iTunes platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Movie showtimes.</b> Can they give this a good/fast UI? Sherlock 2 isn&#8217;t so bad, but I never have the app running. iTunes is always there.</li>
<li><b>Music magazine.</b> Both original articles and syndicated articles from major magazines and even weblogs.</li>
<li><b>RSS reader.</b> What app couldn&#8217;t use a little RSS? I&#8217;d like music feeds (which <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/MRSS/rssGenerator">Apple already provides</a>) directly in iTunes instead of NetNewsWire. Double-click a news item to hear a song preview, of course.</li>
<li><b>Recommendations from library.</b> This has been suggested before: An option to feed local playlists to iTMS servers to improve recommendations. This is different than publicly shared iMixes, but maybe could be an extension of that feature.</li>
<li><b>Amazon integration for CDs.</b> Not all music is available in iTMS. I&#8217;d like a simple Amazon interface off of their search results, for those times I can&#8217;t find what I&#8217;m looking for in iTMS.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2004-04-14.22:22">&#8220;What if Mail.app were like iTunes?&#8221;</a>, Rui Carmo rattles off a dozen features that would be nice in Mail, but he only hints at the real question. What makes iTunes such a great app? Clearly some of it is interface design. Then there&#8217;s the incredible speed, which also affects usability. iTunes is the only iApp still written in Carbon, is that a relevant distinction? Does iTunes (because of the music store and iPod) simply get more resources within Apple? Maybe. But even with all of these things, you can&#8217;t continue to build and ship a great app without a smart team and tight integration between related groups (UI, WebObjects, etc), and ultimately I think that&#8217;s what makes any product a success.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see what the iTunes folks come up with for 5.0.</p>

			<p>After two years of using Radio Userland, I decided to migrate this weblog to Movable Type. I wrote a UserTalk script to export my data for importing into Movable Type, and everything went about as well as could be expected. I&#8217;m making small tweaks to the design, and I added some category pages (still filing old posts in the appropriate categories, since that wasn&#8217;t preserved in the migration). Otherwise it&#8217;s the same site for now. I originally purchased Radio thinking I would customize it, having done a fair bit of Frontier programming <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/credits#may1996Frontier40mac">back in the day</a>. I haven&#8217;t had time, so for now I&#8217;ll give Movable Type a try.</p>
<p>The Six Apart folks have something interesting planned for weblog comments, sort of a single sign-on system with (presumably) a central user registration server. More information is up at <a href="http://www.typekey.com/">TypeKey.com</a>. It will be interesting to see how open their system is, and what other services could potentially be build on top of it.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>My new G5 arrived last week. This machine replaces (supplements) my old TiBook, which was really showing signs of age even with Panther. It is an understatement to say the G5 is a fast machine, and it makes programming a joy again.</p>
<p>Of all the machines in my office now, the new G5 most resembles another machine I got just a few months ago: an old Power Mac 9600. That machine was a monster in its day too. As a Linux server, it does the job quite nicely. I finally finished migrated this site and email to it last night. (If you&#8217;re wondering why I would move this site to such an old machine, I should point out that this site used to run on a Power Mac 7600, even more ancient and running an extremely old Linux Kernel. Both run <a href="http://www.yellowdoglinux.com/">Yellow Dog Linux</a>.)</p>
<p>In the process I learned something valuable: <a href="http://www.webmin.com/">Webmin</a> is your friend. I had heard of this web-based unix administration suite years ago, but finally tried it yesterday. I configured a bunch of stuff that I didn&#8217;t know how to touch before now. I like the power of the command line, but using Webmin probably shaved two hours off of what I was doing. The only real problem I ran into was with Postfix, and I had to do a little troubleshooting with netstat and friends. Overall the migration went very well.</p>

			<p>Jeffrey Veen argues for the <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000266.php">practical advantages of new web standards</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Huge interfaces squeezed through plodding modem connections have been a plague since the Web&#8217;s inception. The increasing dominance of broadband has only helped a bit. A hotel phone line plugged into a business traveler&#8217;s laptop may be the only tenuous link you&#8217;ve got to a new customer. Adopting clean, standardized code gives users a shortcut to accomplishing their goals at your site.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And, in tribute to HotWired and the old school of web design, I present a list of things I miss from when the web was young:</p>
<ul>
<li>webmaster@hostname email addresses</li>
<li>&#8220;best viewed in Netscape 2&#8243; buttons</li>

			<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2003/06/you_have_new_mail.html">John Gruber</a>: &#8220;The elephant in the middle of the room, of course, is Apple Mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a while now I have regretted switching to Apple Mail. But this is not unusual, because I have regretted switching to <b>every single email client I have tried</b> since the Eudora days. Let&#8217;s face it &#8212; Eudora&#8217;s ugly, but it was a rock-solid app.</p>
<p>The first big mistake was moving to <a href="http://www.cyberdog.org/">CyberDog</a>. There was a lot to like about that app, and I was a big fan of OpenDoc, but even today I have a bunch of mail stuck in its proprietary formats. I need to boot into Mac OS 8 and extract that stuff one of these days.</p>
<p>Then I moved to Mailsmith. Unfortunately I lost mail due to corrupted databases. I have no idea how to get that stuff out. Even so, the 2.0 release sounds nice, and I&#8217;d be willing to give Mailsmith a another try. I&#8217;m stupid that way.</p>
<p>Back to Apple Mail. If you are ever confused enough to think it&#8217;s a great app, try this: delete a single email message in a folder containing 2-3 thousand emails. On my TiBook, the OS locks for a good 5+ seconds.</p>
<p>The saving grace of Apple Mail is that it is easy (presumably) to get out of it &#8212; they use standard unix mbox files for everything. Thank you Apple.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m at WWDC, and Steve Jobs just demoed the new Apple Mail. Pretty nice stuff, but no mention of performance. I&#8217;ll wait to dump Apple Mail until trying Panther, which I&#8217;ll install on an external drive sometime this week. Or maybe I&#8217;ll just get a <a href="http://www.apple.com/g5/">G5 desktop</a> and not worry about performance anymore.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be a fun week.</p>

			<p>SXSW has wrapped up for me, although many others will still be out partying long after I post this. I&#8217;ve had the chance to meet some interesting people. Some of them I have names and URLs for, some just faces and conversations.</p>
<p>The Future of Blogging panel was good. <a href="http://tantek.com/log/">Tantek &Ccedil;elik</a> asked a question about the complexity of <a href="http://rdfweb.org/foaf/">Friend of a Friend</a> (FOAF), and whether a more human-readable/writable format was needed. The question was not well received by the panel, which took the view that tools (like Movable Type) will be able to hide the sometimes messy details from the user.</p>
<p>But remember that if nothing else, the weblog movement has proved that it is the simple formats that will be successful. RSS 1.0 (RDF-based) was interesting, but it&#8217;s dead, and it&#8217;s dead because it was too complicated. Similar situation with XML-RPC vs. SOAP. To get to the point of having great tools that hide the protocols, you need to go through a period of hand-coding. The easier a spec is to understand and implement, the more people will adopt it, the more momentum it will have, and the more tools that can build on it.</p>
<p>I took a bunch of notes in some of the more interesting sessions. Originally I had planned on posting them to the <a href="http://www.sxswblog.com/exchange.asp">SXSWblog Notes Exchange</a>, but alone their value is questionable; they are so interspersed with my own thoughts which need more exploration. Over the next few days I&#8217;ll unravel them and post my view on the topics that have threaded through the conference.</p>
<p>Justin Hall on &lt;a href=&#8221;http://links.net/daze/03/03/03/inlining_notegiving.html</p>
<p>&#8220;>note taking</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now that I&#8217;m practicing more professional journalism, I see less value in a straight recitations of events. I want a summary, with key glowing thoughts brought out, hyperlinked and put in context. Notes are good for article building, but they don&#8217;t make much of an article in and of themselves.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
