				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about and playing with the official Twitter app for iPad since its release last week. The best praise I can give Loren Brichter and his team for the UI &#8220;stacking&#8221; breakthrough is: I wish I had thought of it.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s clear after an informal survey of friends, and listening to folks on Twitter, that the UI might be too clever for its own good. Many people can&#8217;t quite figure out if they love it or hate it. And on top of the UI risk, Twitter for iPad doesn&#8217;t bring any new features to the table.</p>
<p>Third-party Twitter clients won&#8217;t be wiped out by this. So now what?</p>
<p>The first Twitter clients (led by Twitterrific for Mac) provided a quick way to check on your friends without visiting the web site. The second batch of Twitter clients (mostly on mobile) provided a full replacement for the site.</p>
<p>I believe we&#8217;re about to see a third generation of clients that will go way beyond what the web site can do. There was worry when Twitter bought Tweetie that it would destroy the third-party Twitter market, and sure, some developers will fail or be discouraged from trying to compete against a free official product. But really what it does is raise the bar &mdash; that to succeed Twitter clients should be more than just a one-to-one mapping between UI and the Twitter API.</p>
<p>One feature is filtering. &#8220;TweetAgora for iPhone&#8221;:http://tweetagora.com/ has muting and an interesting live aggregation view, like a client-side extension of Twitter lists. &#8220;Hibari for Mac&#8221;:http://www.hibariapp.com/ recently shipped with an attractive UI and keyword filtering, muting, and integrated search results.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s other stuff I want to see, like archiving tweets and better search and curation beyond simple favorites. I&#8217;ve been working on some of these too, in a brand new iPad app for Twitter. I can&#8217;t wait to share the details as it gets closer to release.</p>
<p>Not unlike &#8220;Marco&#8217;s post on the subject&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/208454730, my hope is that free apps and paid apps compete in separate worlds of the App Store. When Twitter for iPad shipped it jumped to the number 1 spot in free apps, but maybe you don&#8217;t have to compete directly with that. Maybe if you hold your ground somewhere in the top paid list, that&#8217;s enough to find an audience.</p>

			<p>I like &#8220;this Flickr set from Brent Simmons&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/brentsimmons/sets/72157623879850432/ showing the stages of building NetNewsWire for the iPad. It&#8217;s exactly the process I&#8217;m going through right now with my new app. Get some placeholder views and tables in there, then iterate, each time filling in more of the missing pieces.</p>
<p>iPad interface design is also proving to be much more difficult than I thought it would be. Concepts that work on the iPhone don&#8217;t necessarily translate to the larger device, and there are very few iPad apps to draw inspiration from. There&#8217;s no standout app from Apple&#8217;s lineup either, at least not in the way that iTunes 1.0 defined nearly every Mac app to follow. With the exception of some very basic ideas like splitviews collapsing in portrait mode, and a generous sprinkling of popovers, I&#8217;ve yet to see much consistency from new touch apps.</p>
<p>Apps that have had the biggest influence on me so far: from the iPhone, Birdfeed and Pastebot; and on the iPad, Mail and Twitterrific. Send me a reply &#8220;on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton if you have any other recommendations.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I get a lot of great feedback about &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/. There&#8217;s value in almost every feature request, even the ones I don&#8217;t plan to directly implement. Some people also suggest that I should copy more from iPhoto. While I understand this &mdash; they want a familiar interface &mdash; it has always been my goal to be different than iPhoto. Why?</p>
<p>Two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhoto never quite worked for me, and only by being different can you hope to be better. I took a few things that iPhoto did poorly (like tagging, video playback, and upload) and built the entire interface around them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I just created a clone of iPhoto <em>but for videos</em>, Apple could expand the video support in iPhoto one day and I would be left with nothing. If my app grows in a completely different direction, however, then even if they add video support to iPhoto my app will still appeal to people who aren&#8217;t satisfied with iPhoto&#8217;s approach.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know I&#8217;m on to something because when I show the app to a certain type of person (who has thousands of short videos, or no quick way to share them) their eyes light up. It&#8217;s now just a matter of pumping out new versions to refine the interface and fill in the missing pieces. I have major features planned for the next few dot release (1.4, 1.5, and 1.6) to try to give customers as much value as I can, and execute on the potential for the application.</p>
<p>Both Aperture 3 and Lightroom 3 now have video support, but I&#8217;m not too worried. There&#8217;s plenty of room between iLife and $199/$299 for Clipstart to carve out a customer base.</p>

			<p>When &#8220;the iPad commercial&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/ipad/gallery/#hardware06 popped up during the Oscars, I thought it captured the power and elegance of the device extremely well. But as I commented on Twitter, after repeat viewings you can see that it&#8217;s probably faked. The iPad must have been filmed on a stand or table and then composited into the shot later.</p>
<p>Contrast this to &#8220;Cabel Sasser&#8217;s&#8221;:http://www.cabel.name/2006/03/nintendo-ds-lite-first-look.html video of the Nintendo DS Lite, which was a faithful presentation of how the game system feels to use and yet still &#8220;sold people on the device&#8221;:http://twitter.com/shauninman/status/10175596516.</p>
<p>Apple stretches the truth with all the iPod and iPhone ads and it never bothered me before, but this one seems wrong. How it feels to hold an iPad will be the difference between a good product and a great one. Can you hold it still with one hand? How easy is it to rotate it? What is the angle like when propping it on your legs?</p>
<p>This is a pretty minor complaint &mdash; I&#8217;ll be pre-ordering my iPad this Friday regardless and couldn&#8217;t be more excited &mdash; but I wish Apple didn&#8217;t feel the need to lie about such an important part of the product.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;Lukas Mathis writes&#8221;:http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2010/02/02/removing-features/ about removing features:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t _have_ to try to please everybody and eventually create an application that is liked by nobody. In fact, since your users are in all likelihood in a situation where they can switch applications easily, and since they probably are not locked in by the need to open a specific file format in its native application, it might be a really bad idea for you to go down the &#8216;simply add up all the requested features&#8217; route of application design.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He also links to &#8220;my Wii Transfer survey&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/07/wii_transfer_survey.html, so I thought I&#8217;d post a quick follow-up. I eventually did remove a feature, and the survey to customers served as a nice sanity check that the feature wasn&#8217;t heavily used. The interesting part, to me, is that the feature I removed was the <em>entire 1.0 product for Wii Transfer</em>. Literally everything that 1.0 did is now gone.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been two weeks so far without any complaints. I like to think that it removes a distraction from the app &mdash; one less place in the app that could lead the customer down the wrong path. And hopefully it&#8217;ll eliminate a tiny part of my support load, as no one can ask me questions or have problems with that feature again!</p>
<p>On an internal company mailing list I once wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Products that don&#8217;t exist yet have a way of attracting new features because everyone sees the potential in something that has no form&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was talking about resisting the urge for everyone on the team to pile on their favorite features before 1.0, but I think this applies to apps with a minimal design as well. A simple app shows promise. A cluttered app with too much going on looks &#8220;done&#8221;, and sends a message that it is mature and maybe going in a different direction than what the user wants. In that way, the irony is that removing features (the <em>wrong</em> features) may actually make an application more appealing to new users.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Clipstart 1.0 tried to be smart about not importing videos that were already in your library, but it stopped short of actually giving you much control over whether to import duplicates or ignore them. I also felt like the window showing duplicates could be improved to provide more information about each file. At a glance you should be able to tell if Clipstart is doing the right thing.</p>
<p>So I put a lot of effort into this for the soon-to-be-released Clipstart 1.2.4, and the result is this window:</p>
<p><center><a href="../../../images/2009/duplicates_dialog.png"><img src="../../../images/2009/duplicates_small.png" width="400" height="532" alt="Duplicates dialog" border="0" /></a></center></p>
<p>It generates a few frames of the timeline for each video (both old and new file side by side), which turns out to be an excellent way to confirm that they are indeed the same file, and also shows the original filename even after Clipstart (or the user) has renamed it. Now I can scan through the window in about 2 seconds and I&#8217;m done. Contrast with iPhoto which prompts after each video is imported, instead of at the end of the batch, and if you blindly trust it by checking &#8220;Apply to all duplicates&#8221; then you have no feedback on whether you made the right choice.</p>
<p>The new duplicates window works with both volume-based cameras like the Flip and SD cards, as well as USB devices such as the iPhone 3GS and iPod Nano. I hope to ship version 1.2.4 soon, and there&#8217;s a &#8220;beta in the forums&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/forums/topic.php?id=49.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> As pointed out by a customer, Ignore and Keep are actually pretty confusing verbs here. I&#8217;ve changed it to &#8220;Skip Duplicates&#8221; and &#8220;Import Duplicates&#8221; for the final release.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Sometimes it seems like every app is trying to be &#8220;the iTunes for &lt;insert subject here&gt;&#8221;. I&#8217;ve worked on &#8220;an app that fits into this category&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/software/bookshelf/, and there are countless more. iTunes 1.0 represents one of the biggest shifts in Mac user interface design we&#8217;ve seen &mdash; single window, source list, and smart groups.</p>
<p>While the iTunes UI is great for music, I&#8217;m not convinced it&#8217;s automatically great for all workflows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ goes out of its way to do something different, by twisting the traditional source list a little to promote tags as the most important part of the UI. At first I feared that some customers would find it worse, that the UI would fail and I would be forced to become more iTunes-ish for the next version. But I think only by trying something different can you hope to be better. I&#8217;ve been using Clipstart to manage my movies all year and the tag-focused UI really works, especially when you start building up your library and can search and find related tags across all your videos.</p>
<p>I released Clipstart 1.1.1 a few days ago with a bunch of bug fixes, and an &#8220;iPhone 3GS giveaway&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/press/3gs.html too.</p>

			<p>Every product needs a believer. Not on the product team, but outside. A champion beta tester. Someone who sees the potential and will offer such constructive criticism and feedback early on that if you don&#8217;t make the app perfect you will be personally letting them down.</p>
<p>This is so critical, that many products succeed or fail to reach 1.0 on this point alone. Without inspiration from your peers, it becomes difficult to push through &#8220;the dip&#8221;:http://sethgodin.typepad.com/the_dip/, the rough times in development when everything goes wrong and you can&#8217;t imagine how your app will ever see the light of day. Seek out that one person &mdash; friend, spouse, blogger, anyone &mdash; who will light a fire under you to ship a quality product.</p>
<p>Yes, I want to hear how much you like my app, but I also want to hear where it fails and frustrates you.</p>
<p>The feedback I&#8217;ve received for &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ is astonishingly well thought out and helpful. I like to think the app is attracting the best kind of customers: articulate and experienced enough to know what they want. If I could only implement half the suggestions to improve the app it will evolve into something great.</p>
<p>Of course, great beta testers only go so far. We still have to work really hard. &#8220;Merlin Mann said it best&#8221;:http://www.43folders.com/2009/03/11/kutiman: &#8220;The only person who can sit on your ass is you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s often true that the further away you get from an event, like the release day for the Safari 4 beta, the closer you get to a fair analysis. Initial Twitter reaction was gut level and some not even based on anything but screen shots. &#8220;My own post&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/02/defending.html was admittedly slightly half baked, but I think it stands up fine.</p>
<p>Now we are seeing some more thoughtful analysis, including from &#8220;Dan Frakes of Macworld&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/139026/2009/02/safari4tabs.html, and &#8220;Lukas Mathis&#8221;:http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2009/02/26/on-tabs-and-docking-and-title-bars/, and of course the thorough &#8220;John Gruber of Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2009/03/safari_4_public_beta.</p>
<p>I wanted to revisit one thing with click-through. If you eliminate the mouse rollovers and click-through for inactive tabs, you end up with surprisingly few places to accidentally click. Here are two screenshots illustrating the difference between Safari 4 and BBEdit.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="../../../images/2009/title_bars.png"><img src="../../../images/2009/title_bars_small.png" alt="Safari 4 tab example" border="0" width="550" height="65" /></a></div>
<p>It&#8217;s true that the file icon needs a hold-and-drag, so it&#8217;s harder to click, and the hide toolbar button is off to the side and less dangerous than closing a tab. Nevertheless, viewed by pixels alone there isn&#8217;t a significant difference between the safely clickable area of these two window title bars if Apple makes this small change.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: If I left too much to the imagination, here are examples of the real Safari 4 clickable areas, not the way I wish it would be above.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="../../../images/2009/title_bars2.png" alt="Safari 4 tab current "><img src="../../../images/2009/title_bars2_small.png" alt="title_bars2_small.png" border="0" width="550" height="24" /></a></div>
<p>And the extreme example with even more tabs:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="../../../images/2009/title_bars3.png"><img src="../../../images/2009/title_bars3_small.png" alt="Safari 4 tab extreme" border="0" width="550" height="27" /></a></div>
<p>The important point is that if you disable click-through for inactive tabs, the safe area does not change even with dozens of tabs, and in my opinion it is only marginally worse than other standard Mac applications, as shown in the first two screenshots. The current Safari 4 behavior, on the other hand, continues to degrade until the window title bar is nearly useless.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The first reaction most people had to Safari 4 &mdash; especially the new tabs interface &mdash; was negative. I&#8217;m here to defend it.</p>
<p>But first, let&#8217;s get the mistakes out of the way, because they are substantial. Safari 4 tabs have several new usability problems:</p>
<p><em>Clicks to close or drag in inactive tabs should not be allowed.</em> As &#8220;Daniel Jalkut pointed out on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/danielpunkass/statuses/1246564500, these &#8220;landmines&#8221; decrease the available space to click when dragging a window. And the problem only gets worse as you add more tabs. It requires too much thinking before being able to drag a window. (You can bet Apple has research that shows most people only have 1 or 2 tabs open at a time, but nevertheless you are going to sometimes have a bunch.)</p>
<p><em>Click-through should not be enabled.</em> Same point as above, but don&#8217;t allow closing tabs or clicking the drag handle when Safari is not the frontmost app. John Gruber has written extensively on this issue, and &#8220;this post from 2003&#8243;:http://daringfireball.net/2003/05/the_problems_with_clickthrough is a good place to start.</p>
<p><em>Title bar font is different than every other app.</em> I understand this decision, but it&#8217;s unnecessary for small numbers of tabs. If you have 1 or 2 or even 3 tabs open, there&#8217;s no reason not to use the full font size so that Safari&#8217;s title bar is consistent with other apps. It&#8217;s distracting.</p>
<p><em>Too subtle.</em> Because nothing in the content area of the window changes, it&#8217;s easy to miss the tabs. They are in a more prominent place but somehow fade into the background. I&#8217;m not sure whether this is a good or bad thing yet, but I&#8217;m leaning toward bad.</p>
<p>There are other largely esthetic complaints about the new tabs, such as how the default wider tabs look odd compared to previous versions of Safari, but a lot of that is just unfamiliarity and doesn&#8217;t point to a specific usability problem.</p>
<p>So why do I like what Apple is doing here? Because I&#8217;m hopeful that this is the first experiment to bringing system-provided tabs to applications.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s &#8220;what I wrote about this issue in 2005&#8243;:http://www.manton.org/2005/05/tabs_are_a_hack.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Instead, Apple should have built upon Expos&eacute; to offer system-wide window grouping state, so that in any document-based application the user is in control of how windows are tabbed. Actions like dragging to rearrange tabs could be implemented once and work consistently across all applications.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In the last 4 years the problem has only gotten worse. Developers are rolling their own tab solutions and there is no consistent behavior or keyboard shortcuts that I have seen. Worse, coding fully-featured tabs with the ability to drag windows in and out of a tab group is very difficult, and most apps don&#8217;t go that far.</p>
<p>The Safari 4 tabs are conceptually the right way to go. It&#8217;s not &#8220;tabs&#8221; at all. Instead, think of it as an efficient way to dock multiple windows together.</p>
<p>Getting the tabs out of the content area of the window is also the first real step to making this available to other developers. While I don&#8217;t think you should stamp this on to all applications, certain classes of document-based applications could &#8220;opt-in&#8221; to this new system and get it mostly for free, with consistent UI and behavior provided by the system. Developers who had special requirements or wanted a custom tab look-and-feel could continue to build their own tabs without worry that their UI would be interfered with.</p>
<p>I have no idea if this is the direction Apple is going in, but the Safari 4 design makes me think that at least someone at Apple has this in the back of their head.</p>

			<p>Centralized app update notifications on the iPhone were a great idea, right? Turns out, maybe not. My App Store icon has a &#8220;26&#8221; badge on it. I have no idea which apps have a new version available until I click and scroll through the list, or use iTunes. The reality is that at least 3/4 of them are for apps I downloaded but don&#8217;t use very often. I now have to set aside some time to weed through this list of apps.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d much rather get a friendly reminder of a new version when I launch the app itself &mdash; maybe even outside the app&#8217;s control, near the top of the screen just like when a phone call is in the background. There are a few apps I use every day that were updated weeks ago, but I continued to use an old version because the notification was lost in the noise of dozens of other junk apps.</p>

			<p>From a &#8220;Wil Shipley post&#8221;:http://wilshipley.com/blog/2008/07/pimp-my-code-part-15-greatest-bug-of.html a few months ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Software is written by humans. Humans get tired. Humans become discouraged. They aren&#8217;t perfect beings. As developers, we want to pretend this isn&#8217;t so, that our software springs from our head whole and immaculate like the goddess Athena. Customers don&#8217;t want to hear us admit that we fail.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The measure of a man cannot be whether he ever makes mistakes, because he will make mistakes. It&#8217;s what he does in response to his mistakes. The same is true of companies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about mistakes and bugs as I beta test &#8220;Sifter&#8221;:http://www.sifterapp.com/. Since it&#8217;s not ready for launch yet I won&#8217;t comment on it specifically, except to say that despite many bug systems becoming very mature (in some cases, too mature) every developer still has a different set of needs. There will always be a new bug system promising to fix all your problems, and for many of us we have to keep reminding ourselves not to code our own. Been there done that.</p>

			<p>There are a few things in this post by &#8220;Ryan Norbauer&#8221;:http://notrocketsurgery.com/articles/2008/02/26/mention-in-wired-piece-on-37signals (via 37signals) that bother me. One is this idea that &#8220;code is meant to be read by humans first and computers only secondarily&#8221;. I understand what he is getting at, but even though I respect new advances in productivity, we have to be very careful to keep our core priorities. There&#8217;s a word for when the balance shifts away from the user and more to us as programmers: selfishness.</p>
<p>Imagine two programs: one is ugly and hard to read, but it compiles and is bug-free; the other is beautiful and readable, and it also compiles and is bug-free. To the user they are identical. They both succeed.</p>
<p>Now take those two and give them both identical beauty and readability, but accidentally break one so that it either does not compile or runs so horribly buggy and slow that it is useless to everyone. Writing code for other programmers to read isn&#8217;t enough. You have to start with code that works before you get all fancy-pants.</p>
<p>This growing trend to raise beautiful code and programmer productivity above the performance or functionality of the final product is dangerous. The final product is what counts. Not how you build it, but what you&#8217;ve built: how it scales, how it performs, how it solves a particular problem.</p>
<p>And sure, there are many times when I write slow, lazy code that doesn&#8217;t work well. But that&#8217;s a compromise you make when you have to meet a deadline, or because you aren&#8217;t sure how to optimize yet, not because you start out by deprecating user experience. If you believe Ryan, it sounds like there is a whole &#8220;movement&#8221; of programmers who toss any potential performance achievements out the window before they even get started.</p>
<p>You can say that great products are complex, and so you need to focus attention on how the software is built and maintained. That is true. When I ported a large application from Carbon to Cocoa a few years ago I made the decision to do so because of future productivity.</p>
<p>You can say that happy programmers create high-quality products. That is also true. When I am feeling most productive I am usually enjoying myself because the work environment I&#8217;m in is encouraging.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t put the <em>practice</em> of software development above the actual result, because to do so means you care more about writing code than solving problems.</p>

<p>&#8220;Flying Meat&#8217;s Acorn&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/acorn/ is the first of those tools that actually delivers. For the most part I can use Acorn as if I was using Photoshop. Keyboard shortcuts for switching tools, selection, basic layer manipulation &#8212; it all works.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been testing Acorn by working on some new UI mockups, a task it seems particularly well-suited for. One of the most refreshing things has been using a text tool that renders text just as it would look in a normal NSTextField control. Photoshop has a few anti-aliasing settings, but nothing that exactly matches the normal Mac OS X rendering, which makes mockups that mix and match screenshots from Interface Builder and new text look out of place.</p>
<p>As a 1.0, this is a very solid app, and most importantly it gets all that non-delicious stuff right. It would be easy when writing a Photoshop competitor to focus on the fun stuff &#8212; Core Image filters or whatnot &#8212; so it&#8217;s nice to see Gus didn&#8217;t gloss over the basics.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s missing? After using it for a couple weeks for real work, the only things I am particularly missing are layer groups (totally understand why he left those out for now), Save for Web (which I hear is coming shortly), and Copy Merged (did I miss it?). And the big one: Open/Save for Photoshop files. It doesn&#8217;t need anything fancy in the .psd files, just the same features of a .acorn file to allow a designer to move between the apps if necessary.</p>
<p>Right as I&#8217;m about to post this, &#8220;Pixelmator finally ships&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/09/25/pixelmator-hits-1-0/. I&#8217;ve only spent a few minutes with it, but it also looks pretty competent. Time will tell whether it holds up for real work as well as Acorn has for me.</p>

			<p>Paul Graham thinks &#8220;Microsoft and desktop apps are dead&#8221;:http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gmail also showed how much you could do with web-based software, if you took advantage of what later came to be called &#8216;Ajax.&#8217; And that was the second cause of Microsoft&#8217;s death: everyone can see the desktop is over. It now seems inevitable that applications will live on the web &#8212; not just email, but everything, right up to Photoshop. Even Microsoft sees that now.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s definitely off the mark with that statement. Luckily &#8220;Martin Pilkington has a counter-rant&#8221;:http://pilky.mcubedsw.com/index.php?/site/the_desktop_is_here_to_stay/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There seems to be a slightly delusional section of web developers who seem to believe that in a few years time all of our applications and data will be online, while our computers run little more than a browser. Of course this is complete bull.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As someone who builds both desktop software and web apps, I&#8217;m very much interested in what happens in the middle. Next generation Mac software in particular can mix local HTML interfaces, web services, and syncing with a traditional rich UI to build something that is the best of both offline and online worlds.</p>
<p>I had an interesting conversation with &#8220;Willie Abrams&#8221;:http://willie.tumblr.com/ the other day about why the Flickr UI is better than iPhoto, even if you take away all the social parts of Flickr. The reason is that Flickr introduces extra layouts specific to certain types of activities, such as the excellent calendar view for archives. Another example of a web app UI innovation is the Backpack reminder UI that &#8220;John Gruber recently wrote about&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2007/03/deal_with_it.</p>
<p>Web apps are usually able to iterate on features and interfaces much quicker than desktop software, but that doesn&#8217;t make web apps inherently better. Put another way, iCal sucks because it hasn&#8217;t been seriously updated in 5 years.</p>
<p>I have other thoughts on this topic, but already I&#8217;ve extended this blog post 3 paragraphs more than intended.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>One of the most interesting (and difficult) parts of running an independent software business is responding to support email. It is very time-consuming and often more frustrating than writing code because the solutions can be illusive. You want to help the customer, but it&#8217;s not always obvious how.</p>
<p>Two blog posts in the last week take entirely different approaches to customer support. &#8220;The first is from Ryan Carson&#8221;:http://www.carsonified.com/web-apps/how-to-deal-with-abusive-customers, who is well known for DropSend and The Future of Web Apps conference. Here&#8217;s a snippet from his response to a customer:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am now marking your email address as spam and your communication will no longer get through. If you don&#8217;t want to use our service any more, please cancel your account.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I was relieved to read the comments, which are more sane. I think Ryan made a mistake in how he dealt with the customer, and wasted a bunch of time in the process. Adding a customer to your spam filter? Yikes. I would have refunded the customer their $5 immediately.</p>
<p>(I actually like a lot of what Ryan writes and the events he puts on, but lately I find myself noticing the differences. As another example, his post about &#8220;outsourcing programming work to Russia&#8221;:http://www.carsonified.com/misc/why-you-need-to-get-rid-of-your-freelance-developer-asap left me puzzled.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Joel Spolsky also wrote an essay&#8221;:http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html on support, and it&#8217;s just about perfect. I especially like his section on <em>memorizing awkward phrases</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s completely natural to have trouble saying &#8216;It&#8217;s my fault.&#8221; That&#8217;s human. But those three words are going to make your angry customers much happier. So you&#8217;re going to have to say them. And you&#8217;re going to have to sound like you mean it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For almost every support email I get, I start by responding like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hi Bob, Thanks for purchasing Wii Transfer. I&#8217;m sorry to hear it was not working correctly for you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This does three things right away that I think are important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greet the person by their name. Kind of like making eye contact. And it&#8217;s respectful without being overly formal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank them for using the product. If they haven&#8217;t bought it yet, replace &#8220;purchasing&#8221; with &#8220;trying.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apologize that the software gave them trouble. This is mostly equivalent to Joel&#8217;s &#8220;it&#8217;s my fault&#8221; phrase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I could probably respond faster by using some macro shortcuts that do this for me, I actually type this out every time, varying it slightly as is appropriate for the question. I then move on to the actual solution or follow-up question about their issue.</p>
<p>This is more than just trying to be nice to people. As someone in the comments to Ryan Carson&#8217;s post said: you need to show the customer that you are on their side. Going negative demonstrates that you care about receiving their money but not actually building something useful that makes their life easier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a portion of 37signals take on being on the customers side, from &#8220;Getting Real&#8221;:http://gettingreal.37signals.com/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At 37signals, all of our support emails are answered personally by the people who actually build the product. Why? First off, it provides better support for customers. They&#8217;re getting a response straight from the brain of someone who built the app. Also, it keeps us in touch with the people who use our products and the problems they&#8217;re encountering. When they&#8217;re frustrated, we&#8217;re frustrated. We can say, &#8216;I feel your pain&#8217; and actually mean it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Most people who buy Mac software from independent developers know that it&#8217;s only 1-5 people behind the company. We can&#8217;t compete with the Microsofts and Adobes of the world on application size, but we can compete on quality customer service. <em>Being small is a competitive advantage.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve exchanged at least a couple hundred emails in the last few months with customers or potential customers. (I don&#8217;t actually distinguish between users who have bought the product or who are just trying it out. They all get the same level of support.) Have I handled each one perfectly? Probably not. There are a few people who are still experiencing problems. But my hope is that just writing this blog post will serve as a guide and reminder of why taking support seriously is worth it.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Last week I said&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/macworld_2007_predictions.html I wasn&#8217;t interested in an iPod phone, unless it was something no one had even thought to expect. Well, it is. I am blown away by the iPhone. <i>The thing runs <strike>Mac</strike> OS X.</i></p>
<p>The iPhone is really inspirational in terms of UI design polish. You can tell they put some years into it. I was playing with Tiger&#8217;s NSAnimation the other night (sort of a poor man&#8217;s &#8220;Core Animation&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/coreanimation.html), and it reinforced for me the fact that UI effects are no longer optional pieces of software design. They can both visually supplement the user interaction and just make the application experience more enjoyable. &#8220;Disco&#8221;:http://www.discoapp.com/, for all the criticism as a glorified Disk Recording framework wrapper, is fun to use. Same goes for the just-released &#8220;Snapshot 2.0&#8243;:http://www.stuntsoftware.com/Snapshot/, which has a really thoughtful single-window UI.</p>
<p>This is going to be another great year to be a Mac developer. And we haven&#8217;t even seen the rest of Leopard yet. Only bump in the road will be if iPhone is a closed platform. The &#8220;comments over at Theocacao&#8221;:http://theocacao.com/document.page/404 provide some interesting commentary on that question.</p>

			<p>Today marks the 4-year anniversary of this weblog. What better way to celebrate than with a discussion of web applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angrylearner.com/">Willie Abrams</a> said in a recent Campfire chat: &#8220;Web applications automatically have sync.&#8221; He hits on the fundamental principle of web applications popularity, and of course that has always been true. But the difference now is that some web apps are actually <i>fast and usable too</i>. (Gasp!)</p>
<p>The rise of rich web applications that seamlessly mix Flash or Ajax while still staying true to the roots of web architecture (REST design, open standards) has upset the traditional desktop market. I first wrote about this in <a href="../../../2005/12/todo_lists_and.html">&#8220;To-do lists and embracing the network&#8221;</a>, which was in a sense a subtle wake-up call to Mac developers: adapt to the always-on internet or any college drop-out with a shared server will obsolete your app after a few late nights of Rails hacking.</p>
<p>But it frustrates me to see such praise given to web applications that, were they traditional, native apps, they&#8217;d be laughed away to obscurity or ignored. Ajax is a huge advancement, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that every application works well for the web. I&#8217;m sure Google engineers spent an incredible amount of work on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/02/22/google-pages-released/">Google Pages</a>, but compare it to Apple&#8217;s iWeb and it becomes obvious how weak web application interfaces still are.</p>
<p>Luckily some people are working through the really tough problems. <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry">Ray Ozzie&#8217;s Live Clipboard</a> may be the start of a whole new shift in web app functionality, allowing data to move between web sites and even out of the browser. But true drag-and-drop of structured data between a native app and a web site is still a long way off.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make some lists, starting with the good.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good web applications are data-driven, multiuser, and use URLs everywhere.</li>
<li>There is some key component that is about the <i>browsing experience</i>. That might be sifting through large amounts of data, viewing old logs, finding people.</li>
<li>The kind of data requires an adaptable user interface, not something with a strict set of traditional widgets. HTML is perfect for this.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other side are web applications that might be built by a team of smart people and with a great technology backend, but the application concepts are confused. They don&#8217;t know if they belong in a web browser or on the desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mediocre web applications think that a single web browser window is an entire windowing system with movable child windows.</li>
<li>No features that actually have anything to do with the web. The result is that it <i>adds no value</i> to the web as a whole.</li>
<li>Trying to replace the whole Microsoft Office suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something else is changing in the HTML/CSS/JavaScript platform. In 2004, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">Joel Spolsky wrote</a> about how instead of picking Mac, Windows, or Linux APIs, developers are building for the web platform and can deploy to any user&#8217;s desktop. Cutting-edge web applications push that claim to its breaking point, as differences between Safari, Mozilla, and Internet Explorer often cause headaches for developers. It&#8217;s no surprise when Microsoft&#8217;s set of Office Live applications require Internet Explorer, but it <i>is</i> note-worthy when Google&#8217;s chat interface does not work in Safari. There is now a whole set of web applications that require the latest version of Mozilla and won&#8217;t work in anything less.</p>
<p>Five years ago we accepted that web applications were going to be useful but ultimately unfulfilling, joyless experiences. Now most web apps have risen from bad to simply mediocre. The truly great ones have a foundation and design that would still be unrivaled in a desktop app. These amazing apps are not content to reimplement an old application as a web app just to allow use from any machine, but they take it to the next step: rethink the problem, stay agile, and redesign so that it&#8217;s not just web-based, but it&#8217;s <i>actually better</i>.</p>
