			<p>&#8220;Last week I said&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/macworld_2007_predictions.html I wasn&#8217;t interested in an iPod phone, unless it was something no one had even thought to expect. Well, it is. I am blown away by the iPhone. <i>The thing runs <strike>Mac</strike> OS X.</i></p>
<p>The iPhone is really inspirational in terms of UI design polish. You can tell they put some years into it. I was playing with Tiger&#8217;s NSAnimation the other night (sort of a poor man&#8217;s &#8220;Core Animation&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/coreanimation.html), and it reinforced for me the fact that UI effects are no longer optional pieces of software design. They can both visually supplement the user interaction and just make the application experience more enjoyable. &#8220;Disco&#8221;:http://www.discoapp.com/, for all the criticism as a glorified Disk Recording framework wrapper, is fun to use. Same goes for the just-released &#8220;Snapshot 2.0&#8221;:http://www.stuntsoftware.com/Snapshot/, which has a really thoughtful single-window UI.</p>
<p>This is going to be another great year to be a Mac developer. And we haven&#8217;t even seen the rest of Leopard yet. Only bump in the road will be if iPhone is a closed platform. The &#8220;comments over at Theocacao&#8221;:http://theocacao.com/document.page/404 provide some interesting commentary on that question.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Today marks the 4-year anniversary of this weblog. What better way to celebrate than with a discussion of web applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angrylearner.com/">Willie Abrams</a> said in a recent Campfire chat: &#8220;Web applications automatically have sync.&#8221; He hits on the fundamental principle of web applications popularity, and of course that has always been true. But the difference now is that some web apps are actually <i>fast and usable too</i>. (Gasp!)</p>
<p>The rise of rich web applications that seamlessly mix Flash or Ajax while still staying true to the roots of web architecture (REST design, open standards) has upset the traditional desktop market. I first wrote about this in <a href="../../../2005/12/todo_lists_and.html">&#8220;To-do lists and embracing the network&#8221;</a>, which was in a sense a subtle wake-up call to Mac developers: adapt to the always-on internet or any college drop-out with a shared server will obsolete your app after a few late nights of Rails hacking.</p>
<p>But it frustrates me to see such praise given to web applications that, were they traditional, native apps, they&#8217;d be laughed away to obscurity or ignored. Ajax is a huge advancement, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that every application works well for the web. I&#8217;m sure Google engineers spent an incredible amount of work on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/02/22/google-pages-released/">Google Pages</a>, but compare it to Apple&#8217;s iWeb and it becomes obvious how weak web application interfaces still are.</p>
<p>Luckily some people are working through the really tough problems. <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/rayozzie/blog/cns!FB3017FBB9B2E142!285.entry">Ray Ozzie&#8217;s Live Clipboard</a> may be the start of a whole new shift in web app functionality, allowing data to move between web sites and even out of the browser. But true drag-and-drop of structured data between a native app and a web site is still a long way off.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s make some lists, starting with the good.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good web applications are data-driven, multiuser, and use URLs everywhere.</li>
<li>There is some key component that is about the <i>browsing experience</i>. That might be sifting through large amounts of data, viewing old logs, finding people.</li>
<li>The kind of data requires an adaptable user interface, not something with a strict set of traditional widgets. HTML is perfect for this.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other side are web applications that might be built by a team of smart people and with a great technology backend, but the application concepts are confused. They don&#8217;t know if they belong in a web browser or on the desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mediocre web applications think that a single web browser window is an entire windowing system with movable child windows.</li>
<li>No features that actually have anything to do with the web. The result is that it <i>adds no value</i> to the web as a whole.</li>
<li>Trying to replace the whole Microsoft Office suite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Something else is changing in the HTML/CSS/JavaScript platform. In 2004, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">Joel Spolsky wrote</a> about how instead of picking Mac, Windows, or Linux APIs, developers are building for the web platform and can deploy to any user&#8217;s desktop. Cutting-edge web applications push that claim to its breaking point, as differences between Safari, Mozilla, and Internet Explorer often cause headaches for developers. It&#8217;s no surprise when Microsoft&#8217;s set of Office Live applications require Internet Explorer, but it <i>is</i> note-worthy when Google&#8217;s chat interface does not work in Safari. There is now a whole set of web applications that require the latest version of Mozilla and won&#8217;t work in anything less.</p>
<p>Five years ago we accepted that web applications were going to be useful but ultimately unfulfilling, joyless experiences. Now most web apps have risen from bad to simply mediocre. The truly great ones have a foundation and design that would still be unrivaled in a desktop app. These amazing apps are not content to reimplement an old application as a web app just to allow use from any machine, but they take it to the next step: rethink the problem, stay agile, and redesign so that it&#8217;s not just web-based, but it&#8217;s <i>actually better</i>.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Everyone complains about software bloat. And it&rsquo;s easy to see why &mdash; applications are bigger and slower than they&rsquo;ve ever been, and users think the dozen features they will never use are to blame.</p>
<p>On the Mac we are lucky to have a large number of great, small, focused tools that solve a few problems well. The best of these become successful, but what then? You have to keep adding features. How do you control the software so that it becomes even more useful without feeling too packed?</p>
<p>One way is to differenciate between visible and hidden bloat. For example, Microsoft products used to have a tendency to take every major bullet point on the side of the box and make a toolbar icon for it. Even if the user only uses 5% of those features, they have easy access to far too many of them, and they needlessly have access to them all at once.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2006/keynote_sides.gif" border="0" height="147" width="215" alt="Keynote slider" align="right" /> Instead, adding features <i>in context</i> allows the application to grow without feeling too busy, and without distracting the user from the core set of features they are familiar with. The new user interface is discovered by using a new feature, and otherwise remains out of sight.</p>
<p>This point was really emphasized for me while using Keynote 3 the other day. I love the contextual floating slider when editing a shape (see image). They could have put this slider in the inspector window, but it is so infrequently used it would have remained disabled most of the time, and cluttered those panes with little benefit.</p>

				<a href="../../../2006/01/limitations_in_toys.html" rel="bookmark">Limitations in toys and software</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>One of the first things you notice when you have kids is how bad the toys are. Everything is electronic, makes too much noise, and is quickly discarded when the batteries run out or when everything you could possibly do with the toy is exhausted. The great toys are the ones that allow an infinite number of possibilities. Each game experience is different, whether it&#8217;s building something new with blocks, or play-acting a different story with dolls.</p>
<p>How do you tell the difference between a great toy and a bad one? If the toy is made to do a few specific amazing things, with a bunch of bullet points and exclamation marks on the side of the box, be weary of it. For example, modern LEGOs come in all sorts of pre-molded shapes. If you buy the pirate set, it will be great fun for the first few days until you realize that it can only be a pirate ship. But if you buy a bucket of LEGOs (yes, they still sell these), you can build a pirate ship one day and a barn the next. Even better, toys should interoperate with one another, something that feels forced if the types of toys are so specifically designed that they don&#8217;t fit well together.</p>
<p>This is especially true for younger children. Visiting the Waldorf School last year they used the example of a silk scarf. It can be a cloak, hat, river, cloud, hair, bed, rope, or the wind. A scarf seems so limited, but it&#8217;s the extreme simplicity that gives it life through a child&#8217;s creativity.</p>
<p><a href="http://keithlango.blogspot.com/2005/08/shining-thru-clouds.html">Keith Lango discusses limitations</a> in animating a scene: &#8220;The next time you have a scene and you&#8217;re told all the limitations that come with it find the thrill of making it work great anyhow. [&#8230;] Let the limitations be your friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one knew whether the original Star Wars (episode 4) would be a success or not. George Lucas used what cheats he could to make the special effects work, forcing himself to be creative within the confines of the budget and limitations of technology at the time. Instead the focus was on the characters and on the story. Twenty years later, with the huge budget of the prequel films, one could argue that he was so distracted with what he <i>could</i> do that the important lessons of what made the first film a success were forgotten.</p>
<p>37signals talks about <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/less_as_a_competitive_advantage_my_10_minutes_at_web_20.php">constraints and doing more with less</a>. I agree with that, but there&#8217;s something else. Some of the greatest software out there is designed in such a way that it can be used for purposes that the designers and programmers did not intend. The software introduces simple concepts that can be stacked and rearranged not unlike those LEGOs. There may be an implied workflow but it is not enforced. Instead maybe the interface flows around documents, which can be named anything and stored in any structure. Or maybe there is an editer that was written for one general purpose but which is simple enough that it also allows editing of other formats.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been pushing for what they call an inductive user experience. It is task-based, context-specific interfaces that attempt to remove the bloated menu and toolbar clutter that the Office apps are known for. The latest phase of this is the Office 12 user interface, which introduces ribbon controls. Microsoft has been going down this path for years though, trying to expose features to the user that would otherwise be lost and buried. They are learning from what works about the discoverability of web applications.</p>
<p>But you want to be careful to not force a certain workflow on the user in these cases, because by doing so the abstract usefulness of the software could be crippled. You don&#8217;t want to go too modal or too restrictive. That&#8217;s one of the reasons wizard-like interfaces were annoying. It&#8217;s not just the idiot-proofing that bugs people, it&#8217;s that there may be some truly useful features hidden behind those &#8220;easy to use&#8221; screens, waiting for a UI to come along and let users use the features on their own terms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, GarageBand is a good example of a focused app (create or record music) that also had broader uses (edit and mix any audio file), which allowed Apple to go one step further and embrace what the rest of us without guitars and keyboards were using it for (podcasts). Basecamp is another flexible app that works because 37signals made the conscious decision to make communication the center of project management, above timelines and charts. Flickr, Odeo, 43 Things, and other so-called Web 2.0 apps will be successful not because of a string of buzzwords, but because they take a very simple concept (&#8220;upload photos&#8221;, &#8220;write goals&#8221;), mix in some communication and sharing, and build it in a way that encourages many different uses.</p>
<p>Most software is just like poorly designed children&#8217;s toys. It might solve one problem well for a time, but it is eventually discarded when it fails to evolve with the user&#8217;s needs. Simple software that solves broad problems can be used for a variety of tasks, and is small enough that it can continue to be improved or integrated well with other applications.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>There is something about <a href="http://www.tadalist.com/">Ta-da List</a> that works really well. Simple things like hitting return to save one to-do item and start a new one, tidying up of completed lists, and automatic ordering of recent lists. And above all else, speed. It is without question the fastest web app I use. Because the application is so focused, even full page reloads are faster in Ta-da than AJAX requests in some other web apps.</p>
<p>These are seemingly simple things, but they add up to an app that rivals any native (Mac or Windows) to-do list software. It makes me wonder how great a native app could be if someone put the same thought into user interface and simple workflow that Ta-da has. The advantage so-called Web 2.0 apps have over native apps is that they are inherently client/server based, but a native application could embrace the network in the same way and (maybe) provide a superior user experience. I&rsquo;ve yet to see any apps that do this effectively, but it will have to happen if the desktop hopes to stay relevant for anything except tasks that benefit from large local storage (e.g. Photoshop and Final Cut Pro).</p>
<p>I use Ta-da List for everything now. Here&rsquo;s a sample of recent lists:</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I don&#8217;t consider myself a perfectionist. In fact, I can often be downright lazy. I write sloppy code sometimes. I am hasty with my artwork instead of thorough. I am always impatient to see the end result, regardless of what I am doing. (Oh, and my office is usually a mess.)</p>
<p>But when it comes to things that really matter, I have pretty high standards. When focused I can solve problems well and my attention to detail usually pays off. I am self-critical, which means I can improve.</p>
<p>I attended a Tufte talk earlier this year, and one thing that struck me was how dedicated he is to perfection. He phrases it in a different way, though, less assuming. &#8220;Do no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>When creating something &#8212; art, code, prose &#8212; there is an immediate personal attachment to that thing. Not only is it difficult to see mistakes in it, it seems almost impossible to throw it out and start again. But you have to. The trick is to see the investment in time not as wasted, but as a necessary first step in getting to the final place.</p>
<p>Write half the novel and then rip it apart, let go of the parts that you know aren&#8217;t working and try again. Refactor, redesign, redraw.</p>
<p>One of the revolutions at Disney in the 30s and 40s wasn&#8217;t just incredible talent, it was things like paying the extra money to film pencil tests, so that animators could see their work as it would appear on screen and fix mistakes instead of shipping it off blindly to the distributor. No one else was doing that because it didn&#8217;t seem to make business sense. That is, until you saw the improved results. (Software usability testing is a lot like that, too.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.animated-news.com/archives/00003772.html">recent interview with Animated News</a>, Andreas Deja talks about Walt and his high standards:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to inspired by Walt and what he did, and his standards. He just had these high standards, he would just give the audience something that they didn&#8217;t expect, that was beyond what they thought they would get, always aiming higher. And that&#8217;s one of his traits, that&#8217;s something to really shoot for, to go the extra mile, do even better than people would expect of you. I think it goes along with being a good artist, you&#8217;re never satisfied. It&#8217;s never good enough. That&#8217;s just the way it is. I think with that attitude you learn.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And with that, I&#8217;m off to create something instead of sleeping.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Leaving <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/sxsw">SXSW</a> I think I noticed two major themes at the conference this year:</p>
<p><strong>Software development.</strong> Jason Fried&rsquo;s talk on small teams set the tone here. Get close to your users, start building the real thing early, and keep it small so you can change easily. In <a href="http://nickfinck.com/presentations/sxsw2005/">&ldquo;How to Inform Design&rdquo;</a>, Jeffrey Veen took part of that one step further. Instead of user-centered design, he strives for <em>self-centered</em> design. If you become the user, you&rsquo;ll know how to build it.</p>
<p>Thinking about software development approaches &mdash; especially when they take an extreme position &mdash; is useful to me because you can take those statements and stamp them onto past successes or failures to see whether there is any connection. Many interesting work conversations followed.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata.</strong> Tags, folksonomies, and the lowercase semantic web. There were at least four sessions on this topic, from <a href="http://complexspiral.com/events/archive/2005/sxsw/">Eric Meyer&rsquo;s introduction</a> on XHTML-based microformats to the panel of RDF skeptics lead by Matt Haughey. These problems are hard to solve. When I was originally interested in an internet of rich metadata it never occurred to me that the solution might come from the grassroots, a virtual community of taggers bringing structure with nothing more than keywords and a few smart pieces of software.</p>
<p>Ultimately it&rsquo;s a UI issue. Flickr and Del.icio.us are successful because they make it easy and provide a clear incentive (the ability to find things again). Other distributed metadata initiatives are simple to use because they work within the existing web we know (XHTML and URLs), but we still need applications that will provide that same incentive for users to care. Maybe <a href="http://www.rubhub.com/">Rubhub</a> is a start.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Jason Fried has been talking a lot lately about keeping your product simple. His <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/sxsw" rel="tag">SXSW</a> session on Saturday continued this theme of doing more with less &mdash; &ldquo;constraints encourage creativity.&rdquo; One example he cites is how <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/001060.php">Ta-da List&rsquo;s lack of due dates or responsibility assignment</a> forces people to find a human solution to the problem, often something as simple as appending a date to the to-do item. Later, if patterns emerge in how users are working around true limitations in the software, then that is the time to add an interface and make it a real feature.</p>
<p><a href="http://tantek.com/log/" rel="met">Tantek</a> makes a similar point when discussing <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN</a>. Rather than create a complex format that attempted to solve several different problems (some of which may not even exist yet), they simply looked at one thing (blogrolls) and paid particular attention to how users were working around the limitations of a simple list of links. Adding &ldquo;*&rdquo; next to people a web site author had met is the same idea as adding a date in the text of a to-do item in the 37signals example. They could then extract the true semantics behind those existing practices into XFN and <a href="http://tantek.com/log/2005/03.html#d13t1722">similar microformats</a>, building on top of XHTML to embrace the way users currently publish for the web.</p>

								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Google Desktop Search is a neat app. The integration of local and global results is brilliant. But it&#8217;s not the future of desktop search.</p>
<p>David Galbraith said something interesting in a post titled <a href="http://www.davidgalbraith.org/archives/000674.html">&#8220;Google lock in&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Whatever Microsoft do, Google have shown the way forward, their desktop search makes your desktop just one more search tab. It brings your desktop to the web rather than the web to the desktop and this seems like a much more logical UI experience.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe. I&#8217;m not sure I totally disagree with that point, given Google&#8217;s dominance of web search. But one thing I do believe is that a native application user interface always has the <i>potential</i> to be better than a web-based one. If you buy into that opinion, it means that we aren&#8217;t done. In fact, it means Google&#8217;s monopoly as it currently exists is vulnerable.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a step back. In general, there were three things that allowed web-based apps to win out in the late 90s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ease of development. Building interfaces in HTML is fast and very flexible.</li>
<li>Speed and storage. Fast databases, lots of memory, and load-balanced web servers.</li>
<li>Cross-platform. New companies put their resources on web-based apps instead of traditional ones. (Also see Joel Spolsky&#8217;s <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">&#8220;How Microsoft Lost the API War&#8221;</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Native apps can&#8217;t compete on those points. Instead, they can win with thoughtful interfaces constructed to fit on the platform alongside other native apps. As an example, lately I&#8217;ve been using Ranchero Software&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ranchero.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a> for weblog writing, and it&#8217;s a huge step forward from the Movable Type web interface. And that&#8217;s not because the Movable Type interface is particularly bad (it&#8217;s actually slightly above average). It&#8217;s just that a web-based app, even running locally, is a black box that cannot play nice with the rest of the system.</p>
<p>Tim O&#8217;Reilly likes to talk about how little apps such as Apple&#8217;s Address Book and iChat provide base features that other apps can build upon (a Friendster-like social app should hook into your buddy list). That kind of integration is difficult with web-based apps because user data tends to be stored locally, and if published to the web, it could be to one of any number of services. Instead of two platforms (Mac OS X and Windows), you may have dozens of individual web-based platforms (Yahoo!, MSN, AOL, Friendster, Mapquest, Fandango, and more). Those services are designed to take your data and keep it; there is not likely to be a standard API to share information between them anytime soon.</p>
<p>The potential of a native app is even stronger in this era of web services. Web developers are going back to their roots, building REST design into their applications from the ground app instead of exposing complex SOAP calls on the top as an afterthought. A recent example of this is Del.icio.us, it&#8217;s API, and the still-evolving <a href="http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/">Cocoalicious</a> client, which already has hooks from PulpFiction and NetNewsWire. Another example is <a href="http://1001.kung-foo.tv/">1001</a>, a Flickr client.</p>
<p>To bring this back to search, Google rose to the top because they were fast, accurate, and valued the user enough to know when to get out of his or her way. Google is still all of those things, because they had unique leadership that recognized those strengths from the very beginning.</p>
<p>So why, especially given Google&#8217;s strong brand, are there still new competitors investing in search? Because there is room for improvement. Users will move to new applications for the same reason they moved to the iPod: <i>it was that much better</i>. <a href="http://www.snap.com/">Snap</a> adds sorting, for example. <a href="http://www.teoma.com/">Teoma</a> added a refine feature.</p>
<p>But unfortunately for the competition, they are trying to do things that are simply best left for outside the browser. Gmail was widely acknowledged as a breakthrough app that could hold it&#8217;s own against native email apps, but that&#8217;s only because native email apps are so notoriously bad. With the limited number of emails most people have, the &#8220;speed and storage&#8221; advantage of most web applications was not a critical factor.</p>
<p>Enter Apple&#8217;s spotlight technology. It integrates with the Finder or any application that wants to play. It&#8217;s extensible by third-party developers to accommodate file types that Apple does not support out of the box (this was a quick complaint from Dave Winer about Google Desktop Search). It has a fast, polished user interface that is built around finding local files and dealing with their metadata in an appropriate way. It&#8217;s just better.</p>
<p>This won&#8217;t be the first time Apple has stepped into search and metadata (remember <a href="http://www.guha.com/">R.V. Guha&#8217;s</a> MCF and the HotSauce fly-through browser? Remember Sherlock?). But it will be the first time it&#8217;s really clicked in the UI.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$9217">Wes Felter said</a>: &#8220;If I just had the Web browser UI I would feel totally crippled.&#8221;</p>
<p>And at some level, Google gets this fully. Take for example their <a href="http://www.picasa.com/">Picasa photo application</a>. Or the Google Deskbar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=efbd2aa3-a713-4bda-bb09-183b91cb9b7a">Don park sees the problem</a> in terms of metadata and less about user interface:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The core problem here is that search engines like Google throws everything into one pot.&#160; For web search, all the web pages on the Net gets thrown into that pot.&#160; Thankfully, hyperlink-based pageranking pulls the good stuff to surface with minimal hassle.&#160; With desktop search, all of your documents gets thrown into the pot without an equivalent of page ranking to measure relevance.&#160; IMHO, there aren&#8217;t enough metadata on the desktop to achieve the same level of utility Google web search offers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>More to the point, Dan Wood commented on the <a href="http://weblog.karelia.com/MacOSX/WatsonStatus.html">accidental integration between Watson and Delicious Library</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In fact, I recently read that Watson&#8217;s Amazon.com tool integrates quite nicely with Delicious Library via drag and drop. A lot of this has to do with the support we had put into Watson for integrating with other applications, including your browser and Spring. If Delicious Library hooks up with PriceGrabber, we may find similar compatibility between the two applications as well, either through luck or through design.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Two simple things made this possible: Apple providing a recommendation for how drag-and-drop of URLs should work, and the REST-style URLs of a traditional web app like Amazon.</p>
<p>A final conclusion, to a post that&#8217;s already too long. <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">Newsfire</a> is a lightweight news reader with a clean interface that is a <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2004/11/3.html">hybrid of native controls and HTML</a>, backed by useful metadata (RSS). And <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Library</a> is more than a book catalog app, it&#8217;s an Amazon UI stripped to just the essentials. Both these applications are at the peak of a shift that has been a couple years in the making &#8212; the convergence of web services, post-iTunes UI design, and system services such as Address Book, drag-and-drop, and metadata. Future apps will be judged by these standards.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last week Apple released the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/AppleSWDesign/">Apple Software Design Guidelines document</a>. I&#8217;ve only just skimmed it, but it looks like the best document from Apple in years.</p>
<p>Take this little bit of advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When saving files of your own document types, include a file type, creator type, and filename extension for your file. It is best to include all three of these identifiers to ensure maximum compatibility with other platforms.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, yeah. Finally some solid, practical recommendations from Apple that take into account the whole system, not a narrow set of APIs.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago I read the Microsoft article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnwui/html/iuiguidelines.asp?frame=true">&#8220;Inductive User Interface Guidelines&#8221;</a>. The principles from the document showed up extensively in Windows XP and will be even more prevalent in Longhorn as Microsoft attempts to cloud the difference between web and traditional applications. It struck me as an interesting approach, one that clearly has benefits for some types of users and some applications. I wrote about it a little last year in a post called <a href="../../../2003/02/inductive_vs.html">&#8220;Inductive vs rich user interface design&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Now take that feedback in the context of <a href="http://www.asktog.com/basics/firstPrinciples.html">this article from AskTog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Usability and learnability are not mutually exclusive. First, decide which is the most important; then attack both with vigor. Ease of learning automatically coming at the expense of ease of use is a myth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple has almost completely ignored the user interface principles that Microsoft is pushing. Here&#8217;s a quote from the new Apple design guidelines document:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Allow the user, not the computer, to initiate and control actions. Some applications attempt to assist the user by offering only those alternatives deemed good for the user or by protecting the user from having to make detailed decisions. This approach mistakenly puts the computer, not the user, in control.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Apple document doesn&#8217;t contain anything &#8220;new&#8221;, but it&#8217;s a great set of principles and suggestions gathered from other sources and put in a succinct format. The new Apple is not without it&#8217;s recent user interface stumbles, but it&#8217;s nice to know that overall they have the best grasp of the big design picture that they&#8217;ve ever had.</p>

			<p>Not 5 minutes after I posted <a href="../../../2004/05/the_itunes.html">yesterday&#8217;s iTunes piece</a>, <a href="http://www.irelan.net/becoming/">Ryan</a> tells me I&#8217;m asking for too much. &#8220;My fear is that too many features will render iTunes a useless and unusable app,&#8221; he writes, and he&#8217;s absolutely right to be concerned.</p>
<p>I will admit that my list contains some less-than-great ideas, only loosely organized around the idea of discovering new music (something I&#8217;ve been trying to do lately). I do think RSS support would be interesting, though, because it would allow iMix-like functionality but distributed across anyone&#8217;s web site and created using any software.</p>
<p>The important point, I guess, is that iTunes still has room to grow, and that&#8217;s not by accident. Smart Playlists and Party Shuffle are two examples of great features that fit well inside the existing interface.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://otterlearn.typepad.com/blogkathleen/2004/05/my_itunes_playl.html">Kathleen wants something similar with RSS</a>, but sort of the other way around: RSS generated from the published iMixes.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>There has been a fascinating discussion among information architects and web designers about the usefulness of breadcrumb trails. Mark Hurst of Good Experience talks about <a href="http://www.goodexperience.com/columns/04/0325.pp.html">the page paradigm</a>, Peter Merholz <a href="http://www.peterme.com/archives/000296.html">mostly disagrees</a>, and Christine Wodtke <a href="http://www.eleganthack.com/archives/003852.html">offers her two cents</a>. Here&#8217;s part of what Steve Krug had to say about the topic in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789723107/mantonorg">&#8220;Don&#8217;t Make Me Think&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For most sites, I don&#8217;t think Breadcrumbs <i>alone</i> are a good navigation scheme. They&#8217;re not a good replacement for showing at least the top two layers of the hierarchy, because they don&#8217;t reveal enough. They give you a view, but it&#8217;s like a view with blinders. It&#8217;s not that you can&#8217;t make your way around using just Breadcrumbs. It&#8217;s that they&#8217;re not a good way to <i>present</i> most sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get my wrong. Done right, Breadcrumbs are self-explanatory, they don&#8217;t take up much room, and they provide a convenient, consistent way to do two of the things you need to do most often: back up a level or go Home.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark might argue that &#8220;back up a level&#8221; is more often accomplished with the browser&#8217;s back button, eliminating one of the points above. (Although the book actually has a whole chapter on this stuff, to be fair to Mr. Krug.)</p>
<p>Yesterday, Andrei Herasimchuk wrote that <a href="http://www.designbyfire.com/000075.html">navigation doesn&#8217;t actually exist</a>. Instead, he argues, there are only ways of finding things, and some of them have nothing to do with conveying the user&#8217;s position. He does a good job of framing the different needs of large collections of web pages vs. web applications. Clearly there is a &#8220;where am I&#8221; to hierarchical sets of data. Users feel as if they are moving between pages that have relationships, and making those relationships clear in the interface (via category lists or breadcrumb trials) minimizes how much the user is required to think about where they are, and how to get someplace else.</p>
<p>Amazon, on the other hand, is a web application. While there are clear navigation elements (browsing category pages, or using the primary navigation to jump between books and DVDs), most of the time the user doesn&#8217;t get lost because they aren&#8217;t moving. Instead of saying &#8220;I am on the search results page&#8221;, they might say &#8220;I am searching for a book&#8221;. The experience is dominated with tasks: &#8220;I&#8217;m adding something to my shopping cart&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m buying this book&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m changing my credit card information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or maybe they are just randomly clicking on featured products. It all feels effortless to the user because Amazon has done such a great job with their search and recommendation system.</p>
<p>Brenda Laurel gave an interesting keynote address at SXSW Interactive this year, one which I have trouble summarizing in any meaningful way, and thankfully has nothing to do with this discussion. But a dozen years earlier, she edited a compilation of essays on user interface design from the perspective of the teams at Apple. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201517973/mantonorg">&#8220;The Art of Human-Computer Interface Design&#8221;</a>, and one essay by Abigail Sellen and Anne Nicol hits to the heart of this issue of navigation. Here&#8217;s a snippet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The number of questions concerning navigation is very much application-dependent. Typically they arise most frequently with applications that are structurally complex and that contain a large amount of information. Hypertext-based software is one obvious example; hierarchically structured systems are another. Users tend to make heavy use of spacial metaphors: they report feeling &#8216;lost,&#8217; speak of going &#8216;up&#8217; and &#8216;down&#8217; between levels or going &#8216;in&#8217; and &#8216;out&#8217; of situations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users often spontaneously construct spacial mental models or mental &#8216;maps&#8217; in order to move easily from one context to another. This has obvious implications for design. Reducing the memory lead on the user is one benefit of making these mental &#8216;maps&#8217; explicit. Users can refer to the map instead of trying to retrieve information from memory to tell them &#8216;where they are.&#8217; Another benefit is that a map can form the basis of a mental model on which the user relies to infer how to get from point A to point B without having to keep in mind a set of procedures for navigation. Thus, by exploiting spatial metaphors and allowing the user to make the inference, designers can help users avoid having to ask the question, &#8216;How do I get from point A to point B?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good points to think about. Instead of attempting to wrap this up with some insightful comment, I&#8217;m going to go build stuff.</p>

<p>John Gruber, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/04/spray_on_usability">&#8220;Ronco Spray-On Usability&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;UI development <i>is</i> the hard part. And it&#8217;s not the last step, it&#8217;s the first step. In my estimation, the difference between:</p>
<ul>
<li>software that performs function X; and</li>
<li>software that performs function X, with an intuitive well-designed user interface</li>
</ul>
<p>isn&#8217;t just a little bit of extra work. It&#8217;s not even twice the work. It&#8217;s an entire <i>order of magnitude</i> more work. Developing software with a good UI requires both aptitude and a lot of hard work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Rick Roe, <a href="http://rick.icons.cx/index.php">&#8220;The Good, the Bad, and the Tog&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The whole point of graphical user interfaces is that they balance efficiency with intuitiveness. An intuitive interface may make some tasks take longer to complete than they could in an interface designed for maximum efficiency, but you can learn it on the spot instead of having to take time digging through documentation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Andre Torrez, <a href="http://torrez.org/archives/000300.php">&#8220;Even You Can Do It&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Stop talking about it an just build it. Don&#8217;t make it too complicated. Don&#8217;t spend so much time planning on events that will never happen. Programmers, good programmers, are known for over-engineering to save time later down the road. The problem is that you can over-engineer yourself out of wanting to do the site.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The last day of SXSW tends to be less about substance and more about winding down after the long weekend and leaving on a positive note. In the morning I listened to Gabriel Jeffrey talk about his success with <a href="http://grouphug.us/">Group Hug</a>. It was a fun session. He is also doing some interesting things with <a href="http://uigui.com/log/">his weblog</a>, such as linking each person&#8217;s name in the comments to a Wiki page. The other hilarious panel of the day was about online dating. The mix of backgrounds among the panelists made for a lively session, and with the tension between the panelists, topped off when Jonathon Abrams (Friendster) tried to hook up with fellow panelist Courtney Johnson (Tickle), you had to wonder if it was all an act. Somehow Lane Becker kept it all together.</p>
<p>The session by Jason Fried of 37signals was the exception to the above. For readers of their weblog, <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a>, the content was familiar. It was a more formal presentation than their game show session from two years ago. I had to leave halfway through, but picked up good notes from <a href="http://www.damon.to/">Damon</a> and the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/presentations/">full slideshow is now online</a>. Also check out the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/book/">sample chapter</a> from their new book.</p>
<p>Jason just posted <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000600.php">some thoughts on the conference</a>, specifically challenging the dominance of CSS and Web Standards this year.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s way too much talk about CSS and XHTML and Standards and Accessibility and not enough talk about <b>people</b>. CSS and Standards Compliant Code are just tools &#8212; you have to know what to build with these tools. Great, I&#8217;m glad your UI doesn&#8217;t use tables. So what? Who cares if it <i>still</i> doesn&#8217;t let people achieve their goals. Web standards are great, but people&#8217;s own standards include getting things done (and that&#8217;s <i>still</i> too hard to do online).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree 100%, and it&#8217;s something I joked about in <a href="../../../2004/03/15.html">my last post</a>. I made the point more fiercely in an early draft of my day 1 post, but ended up editing it out. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading the comments on Jason&#8217;s post, and the other blog posts that will fall out from it.</p>

			<p>Weather changes. The first two days of SXSW were marked with light rain, but today was a beautiful day. Leaving the EFF party tonight, we saw lightning off in the distance. Now, as I write this back at my house, a thunderstorm is passing overhead. A hard rain fell. Lightning flashes and a lingering thunder echoes as it continues eastward.</p>
<p>Several very good sessions today, including an excellent afternoon session by Jeffrey Veen on user-centered design and the <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/">Adaptive Path</a> process. The morning was back-to-back CSS panels. Nothing particularly new was discussed in those, but I found it interesting to hear how the different designers represented on the panel approach design.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">Dave Shea</a>: &#8220;We don&#8217;t care about usability.&#8221; He sees CSS as a way for designers to expand the possibilities of their work. (Witness <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">Zen Garden</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://stopdesign.com/">Doug Bowman</a>: &#8220;CSS is beautiful.&#8221; Not just what the user sees but the structure and underlying code, and the craft that brings it all together. (Review <a href="http://stopdesign.com/present/sxsw2004/hifi/">slides</a>.)</p>
<p>Jeffrey Zeldman wasn&#8217;t there, but he might as well have been. There is a great trick that modern web developers are playing. When justifying their work, they replace any mention of &#8220;CSS&#8221; with &#8220;Web Standards.&#8221; But wait &#8212; wasn&#8217;t HTML 3.2 and table-based layout a &#8220;web standard&#8221;? :-) Of course what they really mean is <em>modern</em> web standards, but this accidentally shorthand aids their cause tremendously, I think. And when I say their cause, I really mean our cause. (Resist <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/tohell/">bad browsers</a>.)</p>

								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I almost skipped the <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive/panels/index.php?action=detail&amp;con=ia&amp;id=10">accessibility panel</a> but I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t. As usual <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/">Jeffrey Veen</a> did a great job of putting the current web practices into perspective with stories from the old school of web design. It used to be that every day was a battle with designers who were taking what they learned from the print or traditional multimedia worlds and trying to stamp it on to web design, whether it fit or not. But the new crop of designers look at building for the web as a craft. Veen says it&#8217;s about &#8220;designing for the web natively.&#8221; Exactly. He sees it now as a business case &#8212; that good design just tends to lead to degradable and accessible sites.</p>
<p>Ironically, just a year ago Veen shared the stage at SXSW with <a href="http://klynch.com/">Kevin Lynch</a> of Macromedia. Kevin was talking about rich Flash-based applications that often see the web as more of a networking infrastructure than a platform in its own right. Now we see other pieces of Macromedia&#8217;s strategy: their Central product by-passes the web browser entirely. Granted, they are doing some very interesting stuff, but it&#8217;s not entirely relevant to designing for the web. The new reality of web development that Veen spoke about is that designers are embracing what the web is about rather than fighting against it or trying to control it.</p>
<p>The next panel continued the accessibility discussion. James Craig brought up Veen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000266.php">&#8220;Business Value of Web Standards&#8221;</a> essay, and Jim Allan mentioned the needs of Palm devices as another business case to help sell accessibility standards.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s usability. Why is it that many standards-based and accessible web sites are more usable than others? I think there are two reasons.</p>
<p>First, adhering to standards is not just conforming to the specification but also following the recommendation of those standards. For example, use the alt attribute on images to specify a text version. But as Jim Allan said in the session, &#8220;you can&#8217;t just blindly follow the guidelines.&#8221; The second part is the education of this new class of web people. What tools do they use? BBEdit and HomeSite. They are hand-coding this stuff which means they&#8217;ve built dozens or hundreds of web sites. You have to build up a level of experience with what works and what doesn&#8217;t to make progress on usability, and you have to be a veteran web user to know the existing best practices.</p>
<p>After dinner we went to the Frog party, where I met up with Mason Hale and even ran into Carl de Cordova, who was a co-founder of WebEdge, the Mac web developers conference I was a part of years ago. I have a bunch of old photos and archives of the old WebEdge site that I should post one of these days (the domain was unfortunately taken over by a car company). Also met <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/">Dan Cederholm</a>, chatted with Eli Pariser of MoveOn.org, and received the Jakob Nielsen playing card (collect all 8) from the <a href="http://www.ok-cancel.com/">OK/Cancel</a> folks. A good day.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I like Jakob Nielsen. He was practically the lone voice of reason when Flash web sites, splash pages, and graphics-heavy design seemed poised to take over the Internet and render it useless.</p>
<p>But lately I&#8217;ve been ignoring his Alertbox columns. This quote from <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20031208.html">one of his latest</a> really annoyed me:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Judging by many of the messages we tested, email design is often a side effect of the software implementation and consists of copy written by the programmer late at night.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Really? Late at night, eh? It&#8217;s bad enough that programmers are writing email copy, but when they do it late at night&#8230; Whew.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some good UI observations on <a href="http://www.scifihifi.com/weblog/software/ProjectLookingGlass.html">Sun&#8217;s Java Desktop from Buzz Andersen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not formally trained in human/computer interaction, but to me it&#8217;s simply common sense that any UI design should be judged both on its ease-of-use <i>and</i> its heuristic value to the user. Put another way: a large part of the responsibility of any interface design is to stay out of the user&#8217;s way while helping him or her perform an action or get to a piece of information as quickly as possible. Usually, slavish emulation of the real world isn&#8217;t the best way to achieve this goal (otherwise, what&#8217;s the point of using computers at all?).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And this is what I had to say in a comment on his post:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Great post, Buzz. At least Sun correctly called it a prototype. (But then they also called it a &#8216;revolutionary evolution&#8217;, whatever that means.)</p>
<p>&#8220;And I agree with Jon &#8212; the mouse is not the right device to interact in 3d space anyway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Expose works so well because it actually solves a real problem (managing too many open windows). Sun appears to be reinventing things that already have good solutions (e.g. iTunes live search).&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another comment on Buzz Andersen&#8217;s site connects this all back to Jakob Nielsen. In <a href="http://www.acm.org/cacm/AUG96/antimac.htm">The Anti-Mac Interface</a>, Nielsen and Don Gentner outline how tempting it can be to get lost in the metaphor-ness of interface design.</p>
<p>But the main layer of problems with Sun&#8217;s 3d experiment is something that Nielsen has hit upon many times, the most famous being his <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html">Flash 99% Bad article</a>: that increasing eye-candy often decreases usability. I&#8217;m also reminded of the <a href="http://www.xspace.net/hotsauce/">HotSauce</a> experiment that <a href="http://www.guha.com/">R.V. Guha</a> developed at Apple to show off MCF, a predecessor to RDF. In hindsight, is &#8220;flying&#8221; a web site really such a great idea?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t answer that. I&#8217;ll leave the MCF trip down memory lane for another day.</p>

			<p>Doug of Stopdesign <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2003/12/15/fixedorliquid.html">discusses fixed vs. liquid layouts</a> in CSS:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Truth be told, table-based layouts are currently more capable of handling this issue than CSS layouts are. I&#8217;m certainly not advocating a move back to tables for layout. But unless dimensions are heavily manipulated by CSS, tables <b>do</b> work well at &#8216;containing&#8217; any objects placed within their cells. This, without needing to worry about content from one cell overlapping another, or a cell suddenly getting re-positioned below a cell instead of beside it. With the current abilities of CSS, I can see why some designers have chosen fixed-width layouts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s refreshing to hear him admit the advantage that table-based layouts still have. I would have expected CSS to be in a better state by now. Designers shouldn&#8217;t have to choose fixed-width layouts just because it&#8217;s easier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=&#8221;http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-css3-page-20031218/</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our idea for 37BetterGoogle was to go beyond Google&#8217;s standard search and offer alternatives based on the words you originally entered. By searching for different forms of the same words and comparing those results to your initial query, Google does the legwork for you, helping you see results you may never have discovered the first time around.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, 37signals has placed the entire design into the public domain using a Creative Commons license, essentially giving the idea to Google free of charge. Good for them.</p>
