				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hossein Derakhshan spent 6 years in jail in Iran because of his blog. Now, with the clarity of seeing years of changes to the web and social networks all at once after his release, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/29/irans-blogfather-facebook-instagram-and-twitter-are-killing-the-web">he&#8217;s written an important essay</a> on the value of hyperlinks and the open web:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;When a powerful website – say Google or Facebook – gazes at, or links to, another webpage, it doesn’t just connect it , it brings it into existence; gives it life. Without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn’t breathe. No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it, it is actually both dead and blind, and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>He mentions apps like Instagram, which have no way to link to the outside world. Too many apps are exactly like this: more interested in capturing eyeballs for ads than opening up their platform. The default for native mobile apps is to become silos, while the default for web sites is to be open and support linking.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a second part to Hossein&#8217;s essay that I don&#8217;t agree with, though. He writes that &#8220;the stream&#8221; – a.k.a the timeline, a reverse-chronological list of short posts or links – is turning the web into television. But I think there&#8217;s a lot we can learn from the timeline. It&#8217;s a valuable user experience metaphor that we should take back from Twitter and social networks.</p>
<p>Building on the timeline is basically the whole point of my microblogging project. We should encourage independent microblogs by using a timeline interface to make them more useful. (Interested? <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">Sign up</a> on my announce list.)</p>
<p>Back to links. Dave Winer, who has been cross-posting recently to Facebook and Medium, <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/03/0783.html">posted about</a> how Facebook doesn&#8217;t allow inline links in the text of a post. As a new generation grows up on these kind of posts instead of real blog posts, will people understand what they&#8217;re missing? Dave writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t end up having to try to explain linking to future generations who have no recollection of an electronic writing environment where words could take you to a whole other place. But I suspect we&#8217;re going there. Unless somehow we can get Facebook to relent and make it easy to link from words in Facebook posts to other places on the web.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a great challenge for 2016. Not specifically with Facebook, but with the larger idea of bringing back <a href="http://anildash.com/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">the web we lost</a>, retrofitted for today&#8217;s app-centric internet. I hope to spend a good part of the year working on it.</p>

<p>I like what ESPN is doing in the sidebar <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/scoreboard">on their NBA scores page</a>. It&#8217;s a timeline of both tweets and short ESPN posts, integrated together with a clean design that fits the rest of the site.</p>
<p>This timeline is a great use of microblogging. The short posts aren&#8217;t limited to tweet-length — they&#8217;re often around 200 characters instead — so they can feel complete and informative while still being concise. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">I&#8217;ve suggested 280 characters</a> as a guideline for microblogs, and having the extra characters to work with really makes a nice difference.</p>
<p>I took an example screenshot from ESPN and included it to the right of this post. The first two posts are these special ESPN microblog posts, and the third is a tweet. I don&#8217;t know what CMS-like system is driving this, but you can imagine using WordPress post formats, custom fields, or categories to achieve something similar.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve become quite the fan of WordPress and Automattic over the last year, since <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/thank-you-movable-type.html">finally switching</a>. WordPress still has some problems — mostly in self-hosted web admin performance, and the clunkiness of editing themes — but Automattic is a good company. Around web publishing and hosting, I think 2 platforms are going to last for decades: GitHub and WordPress.</p>
<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/interviews-matt-mullenweg/">There&#8217;s a great interview</a> with Automattic founder Matt Mullenweg on the Post Status podcast:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I had the opportunity to interview Matt Mullenweg about an ambitious project that included more than a year and a half of development to create an all new WordPress.com interface, both for the web and a desktop app. The project was codenamed Calypso, and we talked about many aspects of Calypso, as well as a variety of subjects that relate to it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>After listening to this episode, I&#8217;ve subscribed to the podcast. Looking forward to being a little more aware of what is going on in the WordPress community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a lot of weblogs. RSS is a great way to keep up with sites that update infrequently, or that aren&#8217;t popular enough to bubble up on Twitter with dozens of retweets. But the Mac and iOS community has grown so much over the years. I know there are many new writers who haven&#8217;t been on my radar yet.</p>
<p>Brent Simmons has posted <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/11/16/blogs_by_women">a great list of tech blogs by women</a> that I&#8217;m going through now. There should be something there for anyone interested in development or design:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I made a list of some blogs I already knew about, and then I asked my friends for more, and they totally came through.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The list grew to include over 50 blogs as suggestions arrived to Brent via Twitter. I&#8217;ve already subscribed to a bunch and look forward to discovering even more.</p>
<p>One of my favorite new blogs is the travel blog complement to <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/">Natasha The Robot</a>, which made Brent&#8217;s list. Natasha was recently <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3973-natasha-the-robot-murashev-joins-basecamp">hired at Basecamp</a>, runs the <a href="https://swiftnews.curated.co/">This Week in Swift</a> newsletter, and <a href="http://www.natashathenomad.com/">writes on her new blog</a> about working remotely. From a post about taking her laptop to restaurants in Europe:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The nice thing about this is that I get a really cool and inspiring office for a few hours &#8211; each cafe or restaurant has it&#8217;s own vibe, people, music and I don&#8217;t feel rushed internally knowing that I need to go back to my apartment or coworking space to actually work.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>When I quit my day job this year, it was partly so we could travel more without worrying too much about my work schedule, outside of when the kids are in school. In fact, just days after I finished writing my <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/2weeks">two weeks notice</a> blog posts, we went to Europe and started a private family blog about the trip. So I&#8217;ve been inspired by Natasha&#8217;s blog as she shares her experience working in different cities.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a theme you&#8217;ll find in many of the developer-oriented blogs on Brent&#8217;s list. Wanting to get better, learning something new, and then sharing it with everyone else. Take this advice from Becky Hansmeyer, who wrote a daily series of posts about what she learned building her iPhone app, one post each day while she waited for her app to be approved by Apple. <a href="http://beckyhansmeyer.com/2015/06/05/waiting-for-review-day-4-visual-style/">From day 4</a>, on design and color:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I think the biggest thing I learned in choosing colors and fonts for my app is not to get too hung up in making comparisons to other apps. I spent a lot of time looking at my favorite apps like Overcast and Tweetbot and thinking about the decisions the developers made, and as a result I wound up feeling like I had to make those same decisions. But that was stupid because my app is my own and is also designed for a much smaller market.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Or this quote from Kristina Thai, who wrote <a href="http://www.kristinathai.com/how-to-be-a-speaker-if-you-dont-have-any-experience/">a post about preparing to give a talk</a> for the first time:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;My presentation didn’t flow, it was jagged and very rough around the edges, but I kept at it, made some changes and it got better. And better. And even better. And then I practiced it in front of a couple of friends who gave me even more feedback until I was ready.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Kristina also gave a talk called <a href="http://www.kristinathai.com/writing/">Become a Better Engineer Through Writing</a>. You can get a sense of the talk by downloading the slides. It covers the value to programmers in keeping a private journal, why you might write tutorials for your site, and makes a strong case for blogging.</p>
<p>Blogging isn&#8217;t difficult, but it&#8217;s still not yet as easy as tweeting. By creating a blog, you&#8217;re making a statement that you <em>care</em> about something. As I go through <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/11/16/blogs_by_women">Brent&#8217;s list of bloggers</a>, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for: what does the author care about, and what can I learn from or be inspired by in their writing? Because the more diverse our RSS subscriptions are — the more varied the opinions in what we read and share with others — the closer it gets us to a strong, healthy community.</p>

<p>He calls the short posts &#8220;blips&#8221;. I call mine <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">snippets</a>, which I borrowed from <a href="http://noahread.net/snippets">Noah Read</a>. I like both names, but even more importantly, I like Jussi&#8217;s approach to owning his own content and providing a simple RSS feed of microblog posts. (I wrote more about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">RSS and microblogs</a> a couple weeks ago.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RSS is solid. It&#8217;s lasted a long time with very few changes, and forms the foundation for subscribing to weblogs and delivering podcasts. It&#8217;s huge and the open web is a much better place because RSS exists.</p>
<p>But even if RSS doesn&#8217;t need to change, some types of apps would be better off if we took a fresh look at the elements in an RSS feed. What is really needed, and when faced with multiple &#8220;correct&#8221; options, which should we choose? As more writers embrace microblogging, it&#8217;s an opportunity to simplify our feeds and tools.</p>
<p>This is my proposal for a bit of housekeeping around microblogging. It&#8217;s not a new format. It&#8217;s just a guide for producing the best RSS. I&#8217;d divided this proposal into 5 sections below.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum viable elements</strong></p>
<p>Look at the average RSS feed and there&#8217;s a lot of junk in it that most RSS readers ignore. While there&#8217;s nothing wrong with including extra XML elements, we should strive for a feed that is simple enough to be easily read. The fewer redundant and unused elements, the more consistently that different RSS readers will interpret it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of an RSS feed whittled down to its essential elements. Most feeds should look like this by default, and only add additional elements from the RSS spec or RSS extensions when it&#8217;s absolutely required (such as the enclosure element for podcasting).</p>
<pre><code>&lt;rss version="2.0"&gt;
    &lt;channel&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Manton's weblog.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;link&gt;http://www.manton.org/&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;description&gt;&lt;![CDATA[
                &lt;p&gt;Hello world.&lt;/p&gt;
            ]]&lt;/description&gt;
            &lt;pubDate&gt;Fri, 04 Sep 2015 15:32:32 +0000&lt;/pubDate&gt;
            &lt;guid isPermalink="true"&gt;http://www.manton.org/2015/09/3007.html&lt;/guid&gt;
            &lt;link&gt;http://www.manton.org/2015/09/3007.html&lt;/link&gt;
            &lt;author&gt;@manton&lt;/author&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            ...
        &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Title is optional</strong></p>
<p>The existing RSS spec says that title is optional. In fact, in the early days of blogging, tools such as Radio Userland and Blogger didn&#8217;t even have titles. We got away from that with the popularity of Movable Type and WordPress, even though some modern apps like Tumblr still look at a title as unnecessary for certain post types.</p>
<p>With microblogging, the title will frequently be empty or missing. Do tweets have titles? No, and neither should short microblog posts published through a traditional blog platform. Skipping the title removes some friction in the writing process, making it easier to write a quick post and send it out.</p>
<p>RSS readers must be prepared for a title-less RSS item. Instead of inserting &#8220;Untitled&#8221; as the placeholder title, think about how your reading UI can accommodate microblog posts gracefully. Blank titles (where the title exists but is an empty string) are equivalent to a completely missing title element.</p>
<p><strong>HTML post text</strong></p>
<p>The description XML element in RSS wasn&#8217;t originally intended to support HTML. It was often a text summary or opening paragraph of an article, rather than full text. With microblogging, you always want the full text inside the RSS feed, including any styled text or inline HTML links.</p>
<p>Some feeds will include the plain text version of a post in the description element, and the HTML version in a content:encoded element, as specified by <a href="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">this RSS namespace extension</a>. This should be avoided in favor of a single description element with the full HTML, using CDATA syntax to avoid escaping characters.</p>
<p>In modern apps, rendering simple HTML is common. If an RSS reader can&#8217;t show HTML, it should strip out the HTML tags itself. It&#8217;s not up to the feed to provide multiple versions. If both description and content:encoded are present in a feed while parsing, for compatibility it&#8217;s acceptable to prefer whichever includes HTML.</p>
<p><strong>JSON</strong></p>
<p>I said this isn&#8217;t a new format, but we should have the option of expressing RSS in JSON instead of XML format. Back in 2012, <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/09/10/rssInJsonForReal.html">Dave Winer wrote about</a> producing a JSON-based RSS feed, with a very literal mapping of elements. If our goal is to cleanup some of the edge cases of RSS, though, we can further simplify it. I&#8217;d suggest collapsing a few of the elements, so that it isn&#8217;t overly nested like XML, and to JSON-ify the item elements into a simple items array:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "channel": {
        "title": "Manton Reece",
        "description": "Manton's weblog."
        "link": "http://www.manton.org/"
    },
    "items": [
        {
            "title": "",
            "description": "&lt;p&gt;Hello world.&lt;/p&gt;",
            "pubDate": "Fri, 04 Sep 2015 15:32:32 +0000",
            "guid": "http://www.manton.org/2015/09/3007.html",
            "link": "http://www.manton.org/2015/09/3007.html",
            "author": "@manton"
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>This preserves the element names and overall feel of RSS, while being cleaner and more JSON-like. Note that it&#8217;s easy to embed HTML directly in the JSON description field. Because there&#8217;s no room for an isPermalink attribute, if the guid is a URL, it is always the permalink.</p>
<p><strong>Authors</strong></p>
<p>A feed for a microblog platform, or a group weblog, might include multiple items each from different authors. The RSS spec says that the XML &#8220;author&#8221; element is an email address, but that is very rarely used in real feeds.</p>
<p>Instead, the author element value should vary slightly from the original specification to include either a simple full name, or a username prefixed with the @-sign: <code>&lt;author&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/author&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;author&gt;@manton&lt;/author&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><em>What do you think? I&#8217;d love to hear any feedback <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">via email</a>. If you write on your own blog about this, send me the link.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Derek Sivers <a href="https://sivers.org/nowff">had a great idea</a>. We&#8217;re constantly writing about the things we care about and whatever we&#8217;re working on, but the nature of blogs is that posts are always falling off the home page. There&#8217;s rarely a single place to get the tl;dr summary of what someone is working on.</p>
<p>This idea hit home for me last week at Release Notes when several people asked how to sign up on <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">my microblog project announcement list</a>. I&#8217;ve linked to it several times in blog posts, but I didn&#8217;t have an easy place to point people to without asking them to dig through the archives. A /now page is the perfect place for that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Shawn Blanc <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/now">linked to his page</a> too, which reminded me to put my own /now page together. You can read mine here: <a href="http://www.manton.org/now">manton.org/now</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://medium.com/the-story/taking-medium-to-the-next-level-cb7f223fad86">Ev Williams announced</a> a batch of new Medium features recently:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;There’s always another level. Another level of polish and power in our product. Another level of breadth to our content. Another level of dialogue and discussion. And another level of progress. Today, we are announcing a slew of updates to bring Medium to the next level and in the process make it more powerful, more fun, more democratic, and more essential.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Those updates include new mobile apps, @-mention support, a publishing API, and editor improvements. There&#8217;s also a new logo. (I know they put a lot of thought into this, and it&#8217;s a strong idea, but to me the logo&#8217;s design is so clever it&#8217;s actually kind of distracting. A little more subtlety in how they&#8217;re using depth could improve future iterations.)</p>
<p><a href="https://red-sweater.com/blog/3079/mediums-new-api">Daniel Jalkut blogs about</a> what&#8217;s included (and what&#8217;s left out) in Medium&#8217;s new API:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;One of the most unique aspects to Medium’s API is the provision for specifying a <em>canonical URL</em> and <em>license</em> on a post being submitted to the service. The canonical URL refers to another web location that should be considered <em>the original</em>, or most authoritative version of a post, while the license designates whether the post’s copyright terms stipulate a post is sharable as public domain or under a particular Creative Commons license. These attributes together indicate that Medium expects and encourages users of the API to contribute content that is not intended to be exclusive to Medium.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>While <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/evan-williams-on-indie-web-sites.html">I generally think</a> the trend to centralized writing platforms is bad for the web, I&#8217;m happy to see these changes from Medium, especially the API and expanding custom domain support. Medium has grown very slowly and carefully. I expect we&#8217;ll see quicker iteration on these new features now that they&#8217;re officially out.</p>
<p>In the process of experimenting with Medium posting, <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/13/gettingInSyncWithMedium.html">Dave Winer shared his take on post title support</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;It seems they have arrived at what I think is the correct answer: posts can have titles or not, and the content system has to be prepared for either case. That&#8217;s where this blog was <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/07/iNeedABetterBloggingSystem.html">in 1999</a>, before other blogging tools and Google Reader pushed the world toward requiring titles. And then Twitter came along not having titles at all, and the intersection between all the kinds of blog-consuming environments became almost empty.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m very interested in this because <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">microblogging shouldn&#8217;t include titles</a>. While Medium is mostly traditional essays, clearly comments don&#8217;t need titles, and Medium&#8217;s quick-posting UI encourages short posts. I hope this approach will get more RSS readers to gracefully handle title-less posts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been blogging here for 13 years. If you take any random post from that first year, the majority of the links to other web sites are broken. The default outcome for any site that isn&#8217;t maintained — including the one you&#8217;re reading right now — is for it to vanish. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">Permanence</a> doesn&#8217;t exist on the web.</p>
<p>We can <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">solve this</a>, but it will take time. For now I think mirroring our writing is a great solution, to guard against domain names expiring and other inevitable failures. But where to mirror to?</p>
<p>Only 2 companies keep coming to mind: WordPress.com and GitHub. I believe both will last for decades, maybe even 100 years, and both embrace the open web in a way that most other centralized web sites do not.</p>
<p>Even though I self-host this weblog on WordPress, I&#8217;ve chosen to mirror to GitHub because of their focus on simple, static publishing via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. It has the best chance of running for a long time without intervention.</p>
<p>I exported all of manton.org with the <a href="http://www.httrack.com/">httrack</a> command-line tool and checked it into GitHub, with a CNAME for <a href="http://mirror.manton.org/">mirror.manton.org</a>. It works perfectly. I still need to automate this process so that it updates regularly, but I&#8217;m very happy to finally have a complete mirror for the first time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to mostly let John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/17/apple-tv-and-the-web">have the last word</a> on the Apple TV vs. the web debate, because I could write about this every day and my readers would run away before I run out of material. I&#8217;m glad John addressed the Mac vs. the command-line argument, though, because it didn&#8217;t seem quite right to me either. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The difference is that the command-line-less Mac was intended to <em>replace</em> command-line-based computers. The GUI relegated the command-line interface to a permanent tiny niche. Apple TV and Apple Watch aren’t like that at all — they’re not meant to replace any device you already use to access the open web.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the most hopeful part of the Apple ecosystem as it relates to the web. Apple&#8217;s other platforms really do have a great web experience. Remember when web sites were faster and worked better on a PC than a Mac? If anything, the opposite is true now.</p>
<p>One of the themes I keep hearing is that a &#8220;web browser&#8221; on a TV will make for a poor user experience, so don&#8217;t bother. I tried to correct that misunderstanding in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/the-web-without-html.html">this post</a>; it&#8217;s not about standalone Safari, it&#8217;s about web technologies that could be used in native apps. But ignoring that, I think everyone too easily forgets what the mobile web was like before the iPhone.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, from the original iPhone introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;We wanted the best web browser in the world on our phone. Not a baby web browser or a WAP browser — a <em>real</em> browser. [&#8230;] It is the first fully usable HTML browser on a phone.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>That was a breakthrough. I believe the same evolution is possible on tvOS — to include parts of the open web and do it with a great user experience. You can start by weaving it together inside native apps. (I <a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6066362971586560">filed a bug with Apple</a> yesterday with a suggestion. It was marked as a duplicate.)</p>
<p>The web is at a fascinating, pivotal time right now. It has been shaken up by centralized publishing, closed platforms, and now content blockers. Users no longer value the concepts that made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> special. The web can still have a strong future, but we have to <em>try something</em>, and we have to try it on every platform we can.</p>
