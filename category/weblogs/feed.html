				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My content is all on this blog or linked from it, but if you&#8217;re following RSS feeds or Twitter it&#8217;s not as obvious where everything is posted. Here&#8217;s a summary to clear things up.</p>
<p><strong>Microblog posts:</strong> Posted here and in <a href="http://www.manton.org/snippets.xml">a special RSS feed</a>. Also automatically cross-posted to <a href="https://twitter.com/manton2">Twitter</a> and App.net, with some occasional truncation.</p>
<p><strong>Longer posts:</strong> Posted here and in <a href="http://www.manton.org/rss.xml">the default RSS feed</a>. Also automatically cross-posted to Twitter and App.net with the title and link. Twitter cross-posting is handled by my upcoming <a href="http://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> platform.</p>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/manton/">to Instagram</a> and then copied here <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/blogging-your-photos.html">using this workflow</a>. They don&#8217;t show up in either of the RSS feeds above. They&#8217;re not cross-posted to Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Timetable:</strong> Posted to <a href="http://timetable.fm/">timetable.fm</a> which has its own feed. Discoverable in your favorite podcast client.</p>
<p><strong>Core Intuition:</strong> Posted to <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">coreint.org</a>. I&#8217;ll usually post a link here on the blog for each new episode.</p>
<p><strong>All posts:</strong> Switching to WordPress brought a new global RSS feed, but I redirect it to the longer posts for now. There&#8217;s a new <a href="http://www.manton.org/everything.xml">everything RSS feed</a> which contains all posts: microblog, full posts, and photos. Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">written about IPFS</a> before, but <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid</a> (from Tim Berners-Lee himself, among other MIT folks) is another new proposal for a more distributed web. I wasn’t familiar with it until reading <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/ways-to-decentralize-the-web/">this article at Digital Trends</a>, which first makes the case for independent content vs. the big centralized platforms:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now a handful of companies own vast swaths of web activity – Facebook for social networking, Google for searching, eBay for auctions – and quite literally own the data their users have provided and generated. This gives these companies unprecedented power over us, and gives them such a competitive advantage that it’s pretty silly to think you’re going to start up a business that’s going to beat them at their own game.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The article continues with the types of data you might share in a Solid application:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  For example, you might keep your personal information in one or several pods: the sort of data about yourself that you put into your Facebook profile; a list of your friends, family, and colleagues; your banking information; maps of where you’ve traveled; some health information. That way if someone built a new social networking application—perhaps to compete head-on with Facebook, or, more likely, to offer specialized services to people with shared interests—you could join by giving it permission to access the appropriate information in your pod.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the showcase applications is called Client-Integrated Micro-Blogging Architecture, surely named mostly for its pronounceable acronym. From the <a href="https://github.com/linkeddata/cimba">CIMBA project site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  CIMBA is a privacy-friendly, decentralized microblogging application that runs in your browser. It is built using the latest HTML5 technologies and Web standards. With CIMBA, people get a microblogging app that behaves like Twitter, built entirely out of parts they can control.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Solid and CIMBA are built on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a>, which in turn is based off of RDF. I’m admittedly biased against RDF, because it often brings with it an immediate sense of over-engineering — too abstracted, solving too many problems at once. I’m glad to see this activity around a distributed web, and I’ll be following Solid, but I also continue to believe that the simple microformats and APIs from the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWebCamp</a> are the best place to start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://thaterikperson.com/10-year-challenge">Erik Person wants to prove</a> Marco Arment’s claim that indie success just requires <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/654375561696047104">working hard for 10 years</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Proving whether he is right or wrong is pretty hard to do. Maybe it’s all hard work. Maybe it’s pure luck. Hell, maybe it only takes five years of hard work, and Marco just kind of sucks at it. Either way, I’m going to try to prove it. And not by convincing you with some incredibly efficacious essay. Rather, I’m going to start my 10 years of hard work today.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In a follow-up post, <a href="https://thaterikperson.com/ten-year-update">6 months later</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In the past six months, I’ve managed to change quite a few things. The biggest change was leaving my job at the end of May. After several months of trying to work on projects in the evenings and weekends, I decided it was necessary to go full-time on the projects if I wanted to see any real progress.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve subscribed to Erik’s blog and look forward to following his progress. I hope he blogs more often about how it’s going. If you look at <a href="https://marco.org/2011/08/">Marco’s blog even 5 years ago</a>, he was usually blogging every day. (By the way, “blog more often” is my advice to nearly everyone, including myself.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dave Winer wants <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/22/1400.html">an open alternative to Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I want it to be friendly to Twitter, because as a user and a shareholder, and a developer who uses their platform, I want to see it thrive. But I also strongly believe we need the open system, the <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/06/18/1324.html">Central Park</a> to Twitter&#8217;s condo buildings on Fifth Ave and Central Park West.
</p></blockquote>
<p>John Biesnecker, reading Dave&#8217;s post, <a href="https://gist.github.com/biesnecker/d585c1ba395ffa5c8148128372aa8e2e">suggested XMPP</a> because it&#8217;s an open standard and federated. But as great as XMPP is for messaging, it seems too different from the web; it would be like starting over. The nice thing about building on independent microblogs is that we can leverage the existing open web infrastructure: all the WordPress installs, RSS feeds, and new work from the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWebCamp</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve tried to do for <a href="http://snippets.today/">Snippets.today</a>. Learn from the UI innovations of Twitter — the fast timeline experience, the effortless posting — but without skipping the important first step of independent web publishing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/14/1382.html">Dave Winer has a good comment</a> for anyone questioning the web:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  So when they tell you they know for sure that the web is dead, or that everyone wants to host their blogs in locked-up silos, or that you can&#8217;t build a great open social net on RSS, you might want to lower your glasses down your nose and look out over the top and ask Reallly? Are you sure?? ;-)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing is certain in business. For every success, there are many &#8220;sure thing&#8221; failures.</p>
<p>I posed a question on <a href="http://coreint.org/241">this week&#8217;s Core Intuition</a> as we were talking about Automattic&#8217;s upcoming <a href="https://dotblog.wordpress.com/">.blog</a> domain name registration. The gist of it was: what is more likely to survive for the next 50 years, Twitter or .blog? Twitter is huge, dominating the news and seemingly unstoppable, but social networks don&#8217;t have a great track record. I&#8217;d put my money on a new top-level domain, both because of the vision of empowering users to control their own content and also because domains were designed to last.</p>
<p>Companies aren&#8217;t exactly <em>designed</em> to fail. But that is their default outcome.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://ma.tt/2016/07/mortgaging-your-sites-future/">Matt Mullenweg comments</a> on whether choosing Medium is a good long-term bet:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In making the decision to hitch their horse to Medium’s wagon while fording a river, they’re probably betting on Medium not going out of business, which I agree there’s only like a 10% chance of happening. However I think there is a 97% chance that Medium’s business model will change in the future because the path they’re on and these publishers are dependent on will not sustain their current costs or the investment they’ve raised.
</p></blockquote>
<p>10% chance of going out of business compares poorly to Matt&#8217;s Automattic itself, which <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/complete-mirror-of-this-blog.html">as I&#8217;ve written about before</a> is one of only a couple web publishing companies that I think could last 100 years. If your goal is to write something that many people can read for years to come, why risk it on an uncertain platform?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a longer <a href="https://videopress.com/embed/MVF9BxaG">video interview with Matt from WordCamp Europe</a> last month, where he goes into more detail on the role of Medium and WordPress. Highly recommended if you&#8217;re interested in the open web, or just curious how progress is made in the WordPress community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just noticed <a href="http://fsteeg.com/notes/owning-your-content-on-the-web">this blog post from Fabian Steeg</a> on the value of personal domain names:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  So the mere decision to use a custom domain for my blog many years ago made it independent of the actual hosting location (wordpress.com or self-hosted) and publishing system (wordpress or my own software). In a way I’ve been referencing a system for years that I only now created. Your own domain and URLs really give you a lot of control over your content, even if that content is actually stored elsewhere for years.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Strongly agree with this. Having your own domain will future-proof everything you publish.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t post as much as I hoped to during WWDC 2016 — just a couple full posts related to the conference, a half dozen microblog posts, and one photo. But nevertheless I wanted to collect them together since I didn&#8217;t have a full wrap-up post <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/wwdc-2015-basketball-and-cartoons.html">like last year</a>.</p>
<p>One of the advantages to hosting my own short posts — and only cross-posting to Twitter as an afterthought, not the primary location — is that I can easily tag all the posts in a series. This worked out really well while <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">visiting coffee shops</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>For WWDC, I&#8217;ve used the tag <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/wwdc2016">#wwdc2016</a>. I probably won&#8217;t go back to tag previous conferences, but I&#8217;ll use this format going forward for attending events where I publish a series of microblog posts and photos.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you were to build a weblog publishing system, would you start from scratch or build on an existing tool? There’s a healthy market for WordPress-powered hosting, for example, from <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> itself to <a href="http://wpengine.com/">WP Engine</a>. People know and trust these tools.</p>
<p>I was faced with this question for my microblogging platform. My requirements were pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The published site needed to be 100% static, so that I could host it anywhere.</li>
<li>The template system needed to be widely used, so that I could draw on existing themes and provide customization for users later.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> looked like a great choice. I’m so happy with how well this has worked that I mention Jekyll in the marketing and footer of published sites. It’s a brand that can help give users confidence that this is built on something solid, and that if they need to migrate to self-hosted, there’s a path.</p>
<p>On top of Jekyll, I built a web interface for publishing and deleting posts, changing themes, and I added XML-RPC support so that you can use external blog editors like MarsEdit. Plus there’s a native iPhone app for posting.</p>
<p>All of this enables another feature that I’m very excited about: full mirroring to <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. When you publish a microblog site, you can have it upload all the Markdown and HTML to a GitHub repository. This is a great way to export or mirror your content.</p>
<p>I think it’s a good foundation. Publishing is actually a small part of the overall microblog platform I’ve built, but it’s an important one. I can’t wait to share more and keep building features up around Jekyll.</p>
<p>I’m writing a short e-book about everything I’ve learned, and I’ll have news soon about early access to the platform. You should <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the announce mailing list</a> before next week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/05/mediums-latest-intriguing-publishing-experiment/">Glenn Fleishman writes for Six Colors</a> about Medium&#8217;s subscription features that will let publishers charge readers:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It’s absolutely clear the revenue side is an experiment, and Medium labels it as such all over. There’s no guarantee it will work for its early partners or pan out in the long run. But it’s the only publishing option that combines so many things in one place without any over-the-top cost or commitment on the part of a periodical.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While Medium is certainly doing a lot right, and I still think <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/silos-as-shortcuts.html">it&#8217;s not a bad place to mirror content</a>, the &#8220;long run&#8221; Glenn mentions is really what we should think about when considering Medium. I have no confidence that Medium will last 5-10 years.</p>
<p>If my whole business was based on blogging, why would I trust Medium to control something so crucial? With iOS development, we have no choice but to use the App Store. Writing on the web isn&#8217;t like that, and voluntarily giving up both control of the publishing platform and 20% of revenue strikes me as very short-sighted.</p>
