				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feels like years in the making, but I&#8217;ve finally moved all my domain names to a single provider: DNSimple. The last 3 domains went through toward the end of 2015. They were .io domains, and required calling Network Solutions to unlock. (I own 13 domains, and don&#8217;t plan to add any more for a very long time.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found that the simplicity of having these kind of things consolidated in one place really improves keeping up with hosting and renewals. It&#8217;s the same reason I moved all my private projects to GitHub, even though it would cost more per month. It means less to worry about, so more time for coding.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve often been thinking about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">the lack of permanence on the web</a>, I also want to be more proactive about extending my domain registrations. I renewed manton.org until 2021.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in using DNSimple, use <a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/9fc1dd2e59824b">this referral link</a> for a month free. All my SSL certificates are there too, although I&#8217;m keeping an eye on <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, Twitter experimented with changing the timeline, so it&#8217;s not strictly reverse-chronological. Then, they renamed Favorites to Likes. Soon, <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/01/05/twitter-character-limit-10000/">they will remove the 140-character limit</a>, becoming Facebook, and the circle will be complete:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The current plan is reportedly to show just the first 140 characters in the news feed and then allow readers to click to expand the tweet and see the other 9,860 remaining characters. The new option may launch later this quarter.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The learner is now the master. Welcome to the dark side.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/hyperlinks-and-saving-the-web">the health of the open web</a>, Maciej Cegłowski gave a talk on web page bloat at the Web Directions conference, and he put <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">the slides and notes online</a> (via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/01/02/website-obesity-crisis">Daring Fireball</a>). It&#8217;s fun to read and there are many great points, but I want to focus on Accelerated Mobile Pages:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The AMP project is ostentatiously open source, and all kinds of publishers have signed on. Out of an abundance of love for the mobile web, Google has volunteered to run the infrastructure, especially the user tracking parts of it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarcasm aside, I think Google&#8217;s involvement is mostly transparent, and I was hopeful about it when <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/accelerated-mobile-pages-from-google.html">I wrote about this in November</a>. Google wants the web to be fast. A faster web includes more ad impressions and is more competitive with native mobile apps. I don&#8217;t think this disqualifies Google from proposing this project.</p>
<p><a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/12/14/does-amp-counter-an-existential-threat-to-google.html">High Scalability has a long article</a> exploring AMP:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Google needs an open and rich ecosystem of knowledge. If that’s not there then Google search won’t be relevant. Which is Google’s direct self-interest, which is also the same objective of the publisher. Publishers need access to an open ecosystem of distribution. Otherwise they’ll have a harder time building audiences if they have to appeal to closed platforms. Yes, Google is a private company that has business interests, but that philosophy and that core similar objective is something very important when considering Google’s role in AMP.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to give Google the benefit of the doubt on AMP. The alternatives are too focused on specific platforms and so even less available to the rest of the web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hossein Derakhshan spent 6 years in jail in Iran because of his blog. Now, with the clarity of seeing years of changes to the web and social networks all at once after his release, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/29/irans-blogfather-facebook-instagram-and-twitter-are-killing-the-web">he&#8217;s written an important essay</a> on the value of hyperlinks and the open web:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;When a powerful website – say Google or Facebook – gazes at, or links to, another webpage, it doesn’t just connect it , it brings it into existence; gives it life. Without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn’t breathe. No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it, it is actually both dead and blind, and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>He mentions apps like Instagram, which have no way to link to the outside world. Too many apps are exactly like this: more interested in capturing eyeballs for ads than opening up their platform. The default for native mobile apps is to become silos, while the default for web sites is to be open and support linking.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a second part to Hossein&#8217;s essay that I don&#8217;t agree with, though. He writes that &#8220;the stream&#8221; – a.k.a the timeline, a reverse-chronological list of short posts or links – is turning the web into television. But I think there&#8217;s a lot we can learn from the timeline. It&#8217;s a valuable user experience metaphor that we should take back from Twitter and social networks.</p>
<p>Building on the timeline is basically the whole point of my microblogging project. We should encourage independent microblogs by using a timeline interface to make them more useful. (Interested? <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">Sign up</a> on my announce list.)</p>
<p>Back to links. Dave Winer, who has been cross-posting recently to Facebook and Medium, <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/03/0783.html">posted about</a> how Facebook doesn&#8217;t allow inline links in the text of a post. As a new generation grows up on these kind of posts instead of real blog posts, will people understand what they&#8217;re missing? Dave writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t end up having to try to explain linking to future generations who have no recollection of an electronic writing environment where words could take you to a whole other place. But I suspect we&#8217;re going there. Unless somehow we can get Facebook to relent and make it easy to link from words in Facebook posts to other places on the web.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a great challenge for 2016. Not specifically with Facebook, but with the larger idea of bringing back <a href="http://anildash.com/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">the web we lost</a>, retrofitted for today&#8217;s app-centric internet. I hope to spend a good part of the year working on it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/12/apple-watch-follow-up">Stephen Hackett posted</a> an Apple Watch follow-up recently. He has mostly stopped wearing it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The Apple Watch can do a lot of neat things, and I miss its fitness tracking, but so much of it just doesn&#8217;t fit my lifestyle anymore. It&#8217;s not super useful for work, apps are still miserably slow and at times, its an additional distraction.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Apple Watch is a very personal device. It&#8217;s okay that it&#8217;s not for everyone. There&#8217;s no network effect; the watch isn&#8217;t better or worse if other people don&#8217;t use it. And it&#8217;s even okay if most of the apps are too slow to bother with. Fitness tracking, notifications, the time — for me, those 3 simple features are enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2015/12/17/apple-watch-revisited">Casey Liss also writes</a> that notifications have been one of the most important features, letting him keep his iPhone ringer off:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The Apple Watch has allowed my iPhone to transition from being a <em>personal</em> device to being a <em>private</em> one. That’s a really profound change. More so than I expected.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Once every couple of months, I leave the house in a hurry and forget to put my Apple Watch on. I survive without it, of course, but I do miss it. After not wearing a watch for most of my life, it&#8217;s weird now if I don&#8217;t have the Apple Watch with me. I expect to use it for years to come.</p>
