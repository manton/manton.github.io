				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://coreint.org/211">Today on Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I talk about my time at the tvOS Tech Talk and the recent executive changes at Apple. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Manton and Daniel discuss Apple TV development challenges, Apple’s executive team shakeup and its impact on the App Stores, and keeping a good attitude about successes and shortcomings as an ambitious indie developer.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>We wrap up the show with a conversation about taking risks and setting the right priorities for an indie business. Along the way I mention <a href="http://twitter.com/boltcity/status/6672228351">this tweet from Kazu Kibuishi</a>, which I misquoted slightly. Here&#8217;s the actual text:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;A professor once told me that &#8216;if you have a fallback, you will fall back.&#8217; I have found this to be true.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you enjoy the show, consider letting a friend know about it, or leaving a mini review on Twitter or iTunes. Thanks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/12/17Apple-Names-Jeff-Williams-Chief-Operating-Officer.html">Apple announced</a> some leadership changes today, including that Phil Schiller will now lead the App Store on Apple&#8217;s various platforms:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;With added responsibility for the App Store, Phil Schiller will focus on strategies to extend the ecosystem Apple customers have come to love when using their iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Phil now leads nearly all developer-related functions at Apple, in addition to his other marketing responsibilities including Worldwide Product Marketing, international marketing, education and business marketing.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>You may remember that Phil Schiller has gotten involved in controversial App Store rejections in the past, going back to 2009. See <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2009/08/phil_schiller_app_store">this post from Daring Fireball</a> about Ninjawords, and another article <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/15/phil-schiller-is-a-man-on-a-mission-to-save-the-app-store/">at Techcrunch by MG Siegler</a>.</p>
<p>On recent episodes of <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, and in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/12/too-late-to-save-the-mas.html">a blog post</a>, I&#8217;ve argued that Apple can&#8217;t just make small improvements to the Mac App Store anymore. The time for slow iteration is over; now they have to make big changes to get developers back. I&#8217;d like to believe that putting Phil in charge is exactly that kind of first big step.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Less optimistically, though, there was <a href="http://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2012/06/08/in-response-to-mr-schiller/">this post in 2012 from Rogue Amoeba</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/12/episode-210-they-pushed-it-to-github/">latest Core Intuition</a>, we talk about open source Swift, it&#8217;s potential for web server frameworks, and more about blogging tools. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Daniel and Manton react to Swift’s open-sourcing, and the extent to which it adds momentum to the language and increases its appeal. They also discuss the open-sourcing of Microsoft’s MarsEdit-esque blog editor, Windows Live Writer.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>There were also a few new jobs posted to <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">jobs.coreint.org</a> yesterday. Check them out if you&#8217;re considering a change for 2016, or just curious what is out there for Objective-C and Swift jobs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/espn_sidebar.png" width="219" height="478" border="0" style="border: 0px; padding-left: 20px; padding-bottom: 15px; box-shadow: none;" align="right" /></p>
<p>I like what ESPN is doing in the sidebar <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/scoreboard">on their NBA scores page</a>. It&#8217;s a timeline of both tweets and short ESPN posts, integrated together with a clean design that fits the rest of the site.</p>
<p>This timeline is a great use of microblogging. The short posts aren&#8217;t limited to tweet-length — they&#8217;re often around 200 characters instead — so they can feel complete and informative while still being concise. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">I&#8217;ve suggested 280 characters</a> as a guideline for microblogs, and having the extra characters to work with really makes a nice difference.</p>
<p>I took an example screenshot from ESPN and included it to the right of this post. The first two posts are these special ESPN microblog posts, and the third is a tweet. I don&#8217;t know what CMS-like system is driving this, but you can imagine using WordPress post formats, custom fields, or categories to achieve something similar.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve become quite the fan of WordPress and Automattic over the last year, since <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/thank-you-movable-type.html">finally switching</a>. WordPress still has some problems — mostly in self-hosted web admin performance, and the clunkiness of editing themes — but Automattic is a good company. Around web publishing and hosting, I think 2 platforms are going to last for decades: GitHub and WordPress.</p>
<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/interviews-matt-mullenweg/">There&#8217;s a great interview</a> with Automattic founder Matt Mullenweg on the Post Status podcast:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I had the opportunity to interview Matt Mullenweg about an ambitious project that included more than a year and a half of development to create an all new WordPress.com interface, both for the web and a desktop app. The project was codenamed Calypso, and we talked about many aspects of Calypso, as well as a variety of subjects that relate to it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>After listening to this episode, I&#8217;ve subscribed to the podcast. Looking forward to being a little more aware of what is going on in the WordPress community.</p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/12/episode-209-we-need-a-grand-gesture/">today&#8217;s Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I talked about Swift for about half of the 50-minute episode. We recorded the episode yesterday afternoon, before the open source announcement, so we&#8217;ll be following up next week on everything that has changed. I bet there will be some more progress in Swift web server frameworks by then, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard <a href="http://blog.sketchapp.com/post/134322691555/leaving-the-mac-app-store">the news about Sketch</a>. I found this section of their announcement the most interesting, because it highlights that this isn&#8217;t just about technical and strategic problems with the Mac App Store, but also about having a direct relationship with the customer to provide the best experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Over the last year, as we’ve made great progress with Sketch, the customer experience on the Mac App Store hasn’t evolved like its iOS counterpart. We want to continue to be a responsive, approachable, and easily-reached company, and selling Sketch directly allows us to give <em>you</em> a better experience.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Sketch joins <a href="https://dancounsell.com/articles/not-on-the-mac-app-store">a growing list</a> of apps unavailable in the store. From <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/12/01/sketch-leaves-mac-app-store">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Sketch isn’t the first big name professional app to be pulled from the Mac App Store (Bare Bones Software’s <a href="http://www.barebones.com/store/macappstore.html">BBEdit</a>, Panic’s <a href="https://panic.com/blog/coda-2-5-and-the-mac-app-store/">Coda</a>, <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/11/24/quicken-2015-switches-from-mac-app-store-to-direct-updates/">Quicken</a>, just to name a few). But Sketch is the poster child for Mac App Store era professional Mac software. It’s the sort of app Apple might demo in a keynote — and the winner of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-2012-apple-design-award-winners/">an Apple Design Award</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/sketch-is-leaving-the-mac-app-store/">Federico Viticci writes</a> that Apple has to do something:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The simple reality is that, gradually, developers of the best apps for OS X are finding it increasingly hard to justify doing business on the Mac App Store. I hope Apple also sees this as a problem and starts doing <em>something</em> about it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Daniel and I talked about this <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/11/episode-207-pretty-please-apple/">on Core Intuition recently</a>. Developers have been complaining about the Mac App Store for years without seeing any progress. It was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html">over 3 years ago</a> that I pulled my app Clipstart from the Mac App Store to sell direct-only instead, because of my concerns about adapting to sandboxing.</p>
<p>All this time, Apple could have been iterating on the Mac App Store, improving sandboxing entitlements, improving review times, customer interaction, and more. Yet they have not. At this point, Apple can&#8217;t just do &#8220;something&#8221;. They can&#8217;t just improve the Mac App Store a little. They have to <em>significantly</em> improve it, addressing many issues at once. And even then, some of these great apps — Sketch, BBEdit, Coda, RapidWeaver — may not come back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we talk about on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/11/episode-208-crazy-and-doomed-to-failure/">Core Intuition episode 208</a>, I finally got an Apple Pencil. It&#8217;s great. My experience matches <a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2015/11/the_hype_is_real.html">Gus Mueller&#8217;s</a>, about how good the Apple Pencil is after years of using Wacom tablets and third-party iOS styluses:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I find that when using the HB Pencil in Procreate, I get something that is very, very close to what I feel when I&#8217;m drawing in my sketchbooks. But of course now I&#8217;ve got layers and many colors and a perfect eraser to work with. And endless pages. I love it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the question of whether it&#8217;s a &#8220;stylus&#8221;, <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/11/pencil-2/">Ben Brooks sums it up</a> this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;That’s the question I get asked a lot from people — my wife especially. Apple will tell you it is not a stylus because it is so much better than any other stylus, it clearly is something else. So, instead, I’ll tell you that it <em>is</em> very much a stylus — it just so happens to be the best stylus I have ever encountered on any device.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been improving the Apple Pencil support in an iPad app I&#8217;m working on. I haven&#8217;t completely finished reading <a href="http://www.russbishop.net/uitouchtypestylus">Russ Bishop&#8217;s article</a> on supporting the Apple Pencil, but looks like it has a bunch of additional tips in it that I&#8217;d benefit from. It covers not just the API changes to UITouch, but also gestures, coalescing, and predictive touches.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a lot of weblogs. RSS is a great way to keep up with sites that update infrequently, or that aren&#8217;t popular enough to bubble up on Twitter with dozens of retweets. But the Mac and iOS community has grown so much over the years. I know there are many new writers who haven&#8217;t been on my radar yet.</p>
<p>Brent Simmons has posted <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/11/16/blogs_by_women">a great list of tech blogs by women</a> that I&#8217;m going through now. There should be something there for anyone interested in development or design:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I made a list of some blogs I already knew about, and then I asked my friends for more, and they totally came through.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The list grew to include over 50 blogs as suggestions arrived to Brent via Twitter. I&#8217;ve already subscribed to a bunch and look forward to discovering even more.</p>
<p>One of my favorite new blogs is the travel blog complement to <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/">Natasha The Robot</a>, which made Brent&#8217;s list. Natasha was recently <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3973-natasha-the-robot-murashev-joins-basecamp">hired at Basecamp</a>, runs the <a href="https://swiftnews.curated.co/">This Week in Swift</a> newsletter, and <a href="http://www.natashathenomad.com/">writes on her new blog</a> about working remotely. From a post about taking her laptop to restaurants in Europe:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The nice thing about this is that I get a really cool and inspiring office for a few hours &#8211; each cafe or restaurant has it&#8217;s own vibe, people, music and I don&#8217;t feel rushed internally knowing that I need to go back to my apartment or coworking space to actually work.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>When I quit my day job this year, it was partly so we could travel more without worrying too much about my work schedule, outside of when the kids are in school. In fact, just days after I finished writing my <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/2weeks">two weeks notice</a> blog posts, we went to Europe and started a private family blog about the trip. So I&#8217;ve been inspired by Natasha&#8217;s blog as she shares her experience working in different cities.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a theme you&#8217;ll find in many of the developer-oriented blogs on Brent&#8217;s list. Wanting to get better, learning something new, and then sharing it with everyone else. Take this advice from Becky Hansmeyer, who wrote a daily series of posts about what she learned building her iPhone app, one post each day while she waited for her app to be approved by Apple. <a href="http://beckyhansmeyer.com/2015/06/05/waiting-for-review-day-4-visual-style/">From day 4</a>, on design and color:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I think the biggest thing I learned in choosing colors and fonts for my app is not to get too hung up in making comparisons to other apps. I spent a lot of time looking at my favorite apps like Overcast and Tweetbot and thinking about the decisions the developers made, and as a result I wound up feeling like I had to make those same decisions. But that was stupid because my app is my own and is also designed for a much smaller market.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Or this quote from Kristina Thai, who wrote <a href="http://www.kristinathai.com/how-to-be-a-speaker-if-you-dont-have-any-experience/">a post about preparing to give a talk</a> for the first time:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;My presentation didn’t flow, it was jagged and very rough around the edges, but I kept at it, made some changes and it got better. And better. And even better. And then I practiced it in front of a couple of friends who gave me even more feedback until I was ready.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Kristina also gave a talk called <a href="http://www.kristinathai.com/writing/">Become a Better Engineer Through Writing</a>. You can get a sense of the talk by downloading the slides. It covers the value to programmers in keeping a private journal, why you might write tutorials for your site, and makes a strong case for blogging.</p>
<p>Blogging isn&#8217;t difficult, but it&#8217;s still not yet as easy as tweeting. By creating a blog, you&#8217;re making a statement that you <em>care</em> about something. As I go through <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/11/16/blogs_by_women">Brent&#8217;s list of bloggers</a>, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for: what does the author care about, and what can I learn from or be inspired by in their writing? Because the more diverse our RSS subscriptions are — the more varied the opinions in what we read and share with others — the closer it gets us to a strong, healthy community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jason Snell has posted <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/ipad-pro-new-tricks-for-old-dogs/">his initial thoughts on using the iPad Pro</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;What the past few days have taught me is that if I needed to switch from Mac to iPad, if I had a compelling reason, I could absolutely do it. I <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/">can edit podcasts</a>, write articles, edit spreadsheets, generate charts and graphs, edit photos, build web sites, transfer files via FTP, and more.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Jason got an Apple Pencil or Smart Keyboard, although maybe he&#8217;ll have one of each in time for his full review. If you&#8217;ve enjoyed reading Six Colors as much as I have over the last year, <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">consider subscribing too</a>.</p>
