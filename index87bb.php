				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a great line from <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/04/vision-2/">an iPad Pro article by Ben Brooks</a>, where he&#8217;s discussing how Steve Jobs was always conscious of shipping only Apple&#8217;s best work:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The key difference between Gates and Jobs isn’t the vision, it’s the patience, or if you prefer the unwillingness to ship something which isn’t great.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the time just before the iPad was announced. We didn&#8217;t know what form it would take, how much it would cost, or even what OS it would run. At the time, I <em>even wanted it to run Mac OS X</em>. From one of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2008/01/give_us_a.html">my blog posts in 2008</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The primary market for a Mac tablet is the millions of people who look at the <a href="http://www.wacom.com/cintiq/">Wacom Cintiq</a> and drool. An Apple tablet has to run full Mac OS X because it has to run Photoshop, Acorn, and Painter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s easy in hindsight to say how wrong I was, that of course it should run iOS. And today I&#8217;d agree; iOS 9 on the iPad is great. But I thought a tablet would be particularly good for artists, and basing it on the Mac would be the only way to hit the ground running with a stylus and mature graphics software.</p>
<p>That brings us back to patience, and how Apple <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1151235/apple_rolls.html">rolls</a> and iterates. It has taken 6 years from the original iPad introduction to the iPad Pros we have today that fulfill what I had hoped a tablet could be. Was it worth the wait? Yes. But that&#8217;s a long time, and a more impatient company might&#8217;ve taken a different path to get here, and they wouldn&#8217;t have been wrong.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not actually thinking about Microsoft here, but Amazon. Amazon is so impatient not just with hardware development but everything else that even overnight delivery for their customers isn&#8217;t fast enough.</p>
<p>When I pre-ordered the Amazon Echo <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/amazon-echo.html">on a whim a year ago</a>, I&#8217;m not sure that Amazon really had any idea what they were doing, whether it would flop or succeed, or if anyone would understand it. A year later, they own the market for this kind of device and it&#8217;s spread by word of mouth because the product is <em>good</em>. If Apple ever makes an Echo competitor it will be years from now and only because someone else proved the idea first.</p>
<p>Patience is good, and I&#8217;m glad that Apple has a great balance between innovating on brand new products and perfecting existing concepts. But I&#8217;m also glad that not every company is as patient as Apple. I think the industry makes better progress when some companies aren&#8217;t afraid to ship something half-baked too early.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I published 2 new <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable</a> episodes this week, with a shared theme around Kickstarter projects. They&#8217;re both just 5-6 minutes long.</p>
<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/04/episode-19-kickstarter-recording/">Episode 19</a> is about how I finally sat down to record a video for my upcoming Kickstarter project. I still have editing to do, but I&#8217;m already feeling a lot better about actually launching this.</p>
<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/04/episode-20-kickstarter-rewards/">Episode 20</a> continues the discussion of Kickstarter, starting with my reaction after receiving the art book from <a href="http://blog.loish.net/">Loish</a> yesterday. I was really impressed with how well it was produced. Anytime I see something of such high quality I&#8217;m inspired to do a better job with my own work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2016/04/01/uikit_for_macs">Brent Simmons has a good post</a> about the pros and cons of bringing UIKit to the Mac. On the differences between iOS and Mac development, though, one point did stand out for me:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  And there are things Macs don’t have at all — navigation controllers, for instance, since they don’t make sense in a context where you can just show the hierarchy via multiple panes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Brent&#8217;s right that most Mac apps don&#8217;t need navigation controllers. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d have any use for them in my Mac app, <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart</a>, for example. But navigation controllers are becoming more common in Mac apps, starting with Twitter apps especially. I expect an important part of Iconfactory&#8217;s work on <a href="http://chameleonproject.org/">the Chameleon framework</a> to bring Twitterrific to the Mac was supporting navigation controllers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll always consider myself a Mac developer first, even though most of what I do these days is on iOS and for the web. I&#8217;d definitely welcome UIKit for Mac. I&#8217;m getting closer to announcing a new iPhone app and web platform, and while I have a Mac version in development too, I can&#8217;t justify the time right now to finish it. UIKit for Mac would make that decision much easier.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m registered for the <a href="https://releasenotes.tv/conference/">Release Notes conference</a>, coming up later this year in Indianapolis. This will be the only conference I attend this year outside of another ticketless WWDC week. If you didn&#8217;t go last year and want to know more about it, check out the web site or <a href="https://releasenotes.tv/151-our-2-0-1/">listen to episode 151 of their podcast</a>.</p>
<p>One of my favorite blog posts on this site from last year was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/10/release-notes-2015.html">my review of the conference</a>, because I think it both described the conference itself and also captured that inspired feeling you get when you&#8217;re heading off to the airport and your head is buzzing with ideas. And because it&#8217;s a blog, where I allow myself to be informal, it also has the meandering narrative of the everyday — a stop for coffee, a conversation with an Uber driver. My memory of the conference wouldn&#8217;t be complete without those things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to visiting Indianapolis again. I may also look at flying into Chicago and taking the train down, then flying out. Sounds like some people did that last year, and I think it would make a great start considering the venue at Union Station. We&#8217;ll see if the schedule works out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Gruber, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/04/01/tesla-model-3">writing about the Tesla Model 3</a> unveiling:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The crowd enthusiasm was palpable. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/01/tesla-model-3-pre-orders-stack-up-as-elon-musk-unveils-lower-priced-car">Tesla took over 115,000 pre-orders</a> before anyone had even seen the car. That is trust — and rather incredible for a car that they don’t intend to ship until the end of next year.
</p></blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of the presentation, Elon Musk references his “master plan” blog post, where he outlined Tesla’s plan to start with the luxury market and then use that money to build a less expensive car, and then use that to build an even more affordable car. <a href="https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/secret-tesla-motors-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me">That blog post</a> was <em>10 years ago</em>.</p>
<p>Vision takes time to execute. It&#8217;s incredible to reflect on the scope of what Elon Musk’s companies have accomplished. As <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/02/elon-musk.html">I wrote about last year</a>, Elon will be admired by my kids&#8217; generation in the same way that mine was inspired by Steve Jobs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a similar pattern as <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">my 30 days of coffee shops</a>, my friend Jon Hays has started mapping out a challenge to hit a month of coffee shops in Portland. The twist on his visits will be to focus mostly on the east side of Portland, and to only have lattes. First post: <a href="http://jonhays.me/2016/04/01/cathedral-coffee/">Cathedral Coffee</a>.</p>
<p>Jon is documenting the coffee shop visits on <a href="http://jonhays.me/">his new microblog</a>. An indie microblog is a great framework for posting this kind of thing, without the overhead and pressure that many people feel when faced with writing full-length blog posts.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/tag/500lattes">the 500 latte photos</a> project by Aron Parecki, which looks like it wrapped up at a (still impressive) 312 lattes; and <a href="http://www.tinychallenges.com/">Tiny Challenges</a>, a site and podcast from Daniel Steinberg and Jaimee Newberry about trying something new each day for a month.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/03/episode-18-waiting-for-the-se/">On episode 18</a> of my Timetable podcast, which I just published this morning, I mention the new Nintendo game Miitomo. Federico Viticci <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/miitomo-for-ios-goes-live-internationally/">also wrote about it today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <a href="https://www.macstories.net/?s=Miitomo">I’ve been keeping an eye on Miitomo</a> – I still don&#8217;t completely understand it, but I&#8217;m intrigued by the premise of a friend-based network with mini-games and the ability to collect coins. Those coins can then be used to claim rewards and redeem other Nintendo-related content such as games and customizations. I&#8217;m curious to see how Miitomo will perform outside of Japan.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For a several years between 2006 and 2010, I sold and actively worked on a little Mac app called <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/">Wii Transfer</a>. It was the first time I realized that I could make a living selling Mac software, even though it didn&#8217;t always have great sales consistently by itself. To this day, one of the features I’m most proud to have ever written is the Mii export, which could sync Mii data over Bluetooth from the Wii remotes and render it to let you save your Miis as PNG files on your Mac.</p>
<p>I’ve often mused on Core Intuition that I stopped selling the app too soon. At one point I worked on a companion app to the Nintendo DS with similar themes, but didn’t ship it. And I considered building a version for iOS just with the Mii functionality.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/05/saying_goodbye_to.html">From a blog post in 2012</a>, announcing that Wii Transfer would no longer be available:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m retiring Wii Transfer to focus on my other apps. It’s not that it doesn’t sell; it still does. It’s just that it’s not an app I actually use anymore. By officially shelving the whole project, I hope to remove a psychological burden of sorts — to no longer worry that I’m ignoring an active product.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll never know if it was a missed opportunity — a mistake for the direction of my indie business to stop selling something that people liked — or the right call to refocus around what I actually cared about. In any case, I&#8217;m glad Nintendo is doing something new with Miis. As I play with Miitomo, there&#8217;s a part of me that regrets not doing more with Nintendo-compatible software while I had a competitive head start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Hackett loves old Macs. (And iPhones and iPods and Newtons.) His fascination with old Apple hardware and the passion to share it with a larger audience — many of whom weren&#8217;t around for the dark days when Apple was doomed — is one of the things I love most about reading <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/">512 Pixels</a>.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s slowly been expanding into video production with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzXBTOSdtmOz9_VMYffr4g">a channel on YouTube</a>. The latest video covers the iPod Shuffle, the tiny iPod without a screen that Apple still sells. At just $49, it&#8217;s not much more expensive than a long USB-C cable and may be the best bargain in Apple&#8217;s lineup after the $399 iPhone SE. <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2016/3/the-history-of-the-ipod-shuffle">Stephen writes</a> about the original Shuffle:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The first Shuffle was built like a glorified USB thumb drive. This new player was smaller than a pack of chewing gum, and built around the concept of shuffling your music. There was no need for a screen or a true clickwheel. If you wanted to listen to music in order, the switch on the back could be set to continuous playback.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, nostalgia. One of the reasons I blog at all, and have been for 14 years now, isn&#8217;t so much for today&#8217;s audience but tomorrow&#8217;s. Even the most mundane blog posts take on new significance with a few years&#8217; distance. Old technical topics have surprisingly poor representation on today&#8217;s web, as linkrot sets in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to what else Stephen has planned. I know <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/83">from the Connected podcast</a> that lately he has been trying to collect all the different original iMac colors. (Two other podcasts that are worth a listen for an additional trip down memory lane: <a href="http://therecord.co/">The Record</a> and <a href="http://simplebeep.com/">Simple Beep</a>.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.natashathenomad.com/blog/digital-nomad-productivity-trick-one-thing">Natasha the Nomad has a post</a> about prioritizing the “one thing” that has to be finished today, even if everything else slips:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When I wake up (or the night before), I think &#8220;What is the one thing that I can do today to feel like I had a successful day, even If I nothing else gets done today&#8221;. No matter what, I end up getting that one thing done.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I find this kind of approach really useful. Saying you&#8217;re only going to finish one thing is admitting the reality that for many days, if you&#8217;re unfocused or juggling too many tasks, there&#8217;s a lot of &#8220;work&#8221; but nothing gets <em>done</em>. When I work out of the house in the morning with my iPad Pro, my goal is equally simple: publish a single blog post. If I can take care of email, edit other draft posts, work on planning notes for a project, etc. — that’s great too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I went to <a href="http://opencoffeeaustin.org/">Open Coffee Club</a> during SXSW week, I met several company founders and investors in Austin, and one was also an iOS developer. I usually do a poor job of promoting my own work in person, but I somehow managed to plug my <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition podcast</a>.</p>
<p>He hadn’t heard of the show before, and when he pulled it up to subscribe his comment was something like: “wow, you’ve been doing this for a long time”. It’s true. Daniel and I started the podcast in 2008. We only have 225 episodes, because we published episodes less frequently back in the old days, but I’ve always been proud of our consistency with the show format going back to the very beginning.</p>
<p>And it made me wonder: is there another Mac or iOS developer-focused tech podcast that has such a long history? Or really, many tech podcasts at all? The ones that come to mind are <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>, which started in 2007, and <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech">This Week in Tech</a>, which started in 2005.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another reminder to me that a big part of success is consistently showing up to work. If you&#8217;re always starting over, you can&#8217;t build on anything and take it further. The secret with the &#8220;version 2.0&#8221; of most apps isn&#8217;t that it has new features; it&#8217;s just that it exists at all.</p>
<p>In a couple months, just as WWDC is about to roll around, we’ll celebrate our 8th anniversary of recording Core Intuition. Our audience keeps growing, which is amazing, but there are still a lot of people who have never heard of the show. If you like what we&#8217;ve been doing, consider telling a friend, or posting a tweet or blog post about the show.</p>
<p>We expanded to 2 sponsors per episode this year because we wanted to grow the podcast — to commit more time and resources to both recording and to companion web sites like <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">the jobs site</a>. I think 2016 will be a great year and I&#8217;m happy that Core Intuition is a key part of helping me stay independent. Thanks for your support!</p>
