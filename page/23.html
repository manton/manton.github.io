			<p>I first blogged about 37signals a couple times <a href="http://manton.org/2002/03/ernest_kim_and_jason.html">back in 2002</a>, and I’ve been a fan ever since. They had a huge influence on the way I approach design and the way I like to build products, not to mention a big impact on a whole new class of “software as a service” web apps.</p>
<p><a href="http://37signals.com/">The decision last week</a> to go all-in on Basecamp left me puzzled. Daniel and I discussed this at length on Core Intuition. It’s one thing to focus all your efforts on a single product, but seems quite another to rename the whole company around it. I still feel that once you make that choice, your hands are tied from ever thinking big again, from ever wanting to grow beyond the scope of a single product. It’s like saying “our best product ideas are behind us”, and I know that’s not true for 37signals.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I’m sure 37signals understands their business better than I do. And maybe even big <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch06_Done.php">decisions are temporary</a> anyway. I’m excited to see how it plays out in another year or two.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2014/02/episode-123-focus-on-just-one-thing/">listen to Core Intuition episode 123</a> and let us know if we’re off base or not. Last week’s show also has more about choosing a product lineup, managing time, and thoughts on App.net’s Backer. <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/coreint">Thanks to Smile’s PDFpen</a> for sponsoring the podcast.</p>

<p>Good advice. And remember, very few developers actually ship on time. Even if you think your app is going to ship before the next major version of the OS does, your app will probably be late. More people will be able to run it than you first expected.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I was chatting with some developers this week, complaining about <a href="http://www.bluecloudsolutions.com/blog/money-apps-turn-1k-200k-portfolio/">this post on spamming the App Store</a> and wondering if we’d ever have a better App Store, when I finally realized how we get there. The block for me had always been the top 200 lists. We all know that you can game them, buy your way in, and apps that make it in even on their own merits have a huge advantage over everything else, sometimes for months. But I couldn’t conceive of how you could actually <em>get rid of them</em> and if it would make the store better or worse.</p>
<p>The answer is in Beats Music. They have no overall top 200 list! Instead, they have a bunch of people — musicians and writers who deeply care about music — curating playlists. The top 25 playlists in a genre are so buried in the app that I had to search them out just to write this blog post, because they seem to carry no more weight than any other playlist. Much more common are playlists like “our top 20 of 2013”. That’s not a best-selling list; it’s based on real people’s favorites.</p>
<p>There are literally hundreds or maybe thousands of other playlists. Intro playlists for a band, related artists that were influential to a singer you like, playlists for a mood or activity, and more. This extra manual step makes it much easier for an algorithm to surface great music: just look for playlists that contain songs you already like, and chances are good that you’ll discover something new.</p>
<p><a href="../2014/02/we_love_music.html">I wrote about Beats Music earlier</a>, how it underscored to me that Apple needs to find the next product category to fall in love with, just like they used to feel about music. Of course we know that Apple <em>already loves apps</em>. Show that by doubling down on featured apps, staff picks, and app playlists.</p>
<p>How would this fix the junk problem in the App Store? Simple. No one in their right mind would ever feature one of these ad-filled, “re-skinned” cheap apps. Great recommendations mean less reliance on search, making scam apps more difficult to find by accident. (This focus is so complete in Beats Music, for the first couple days of using it I didn’t even realize you could search for a specific song or album.)</p>
<p>This idea isn’t new. Here’s <a href="http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/70498658794/solving-the-app-store-discovery-problem-with-app">Jared Sinclair on app playlists</a>, with the twist that they’re based on apps you have installed and use:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “App playlists should be rigorously simple: just a list of apps. Not all the apps ever downloaded, but the apps that a given user currently has installed on their device. The assumption is that if somebody has an app on their device, they probably like it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>That would be great. But seeing Beats Music ship with almost no traditional music charts at all — in an industry that has embraced the top 40 for decades — tells me that the Beats approach would also work for apps. I think you need both an “installed” playlist and many more fully curated playlists to actually replace the top 200 in the App Store.</p>
<p>Apple will need to ramp up their staff to do this, but if a new company like Beats can do it, surely a company as huge as Apple can also try. And they’ll have help from app fans everywhere. Writers are already doing this: see Federico Viticci’s <a href="http://www.macstories.net/roundups/my-must-have-ipad-apps-2013-edition/">must-have iPad apps of 2013</a> (could easily be an app playlist) or all the <a href="http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-photo-editing-app-iphone/">photo apps mentioned on The Sweet Setup</a> (favorite photo apps playlist) or TechHive’s <a href="http://www.techhive.com/article/2091807/use-these-budgeting-apps-for-more-money-fewer-problems.html">5 apps for budgeting</a> (my playlist would’ve added <a href="http://nothirst.com/moneywell/ipad/">MoneyWell</a>).</p>
<p>Apple shouldn’t wait until Thursday to feature a few great apps. Feature apps <em>all the time</em>. They’re on the right track with some of the “best of” sections in the store, and with the “Near Me” feature. Go a little further and it will make all the difference to bubble up great apps, and let the junk in the App Store fade away. For the first time I can imagine the store without a top 200 at all, and it looks amazing.</p>

			<p><a href="../2014/01/sunlit_maps.html">In my short post</a> about why we chose Mapbox for <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a>, I said I wanted to use it because the folks working at Mapbox clearly love maps. We are so used to mega-companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft trying to provide every possible service, it’s nice sometimes to just buy directly from a specialist.</p>
<p>I think that’s why Beats Music is going to be successful. Music is all they’re doing, they’ve hired a staff of specialists — curators who are passionate about not just music but specific genres — and even their sister company makes music products: headphones and speakers. For more background on Beats Music, I recommend this <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/why-beats-music-matters/">write-up from MacStories</a> and this (http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/21/5325766/interview-with-beats-music-ceo-ian-rogers-video).</p>
<p>Remember when Steve Jobs introduced the iPod? He said: “We love music. And it’s always good to do something you love.” As he continued to play some of his favorite songs, we believed him. The driving force behind the iPod and iTunes was to make it <em>significantly</em> easier to listen to music. They hit it out of the park and changed the music industry.</p>
<p>Today, Apple is either spread too thin or content to do the bare minimum only. iTunes Radio looks like something they felt they had to build, not something they wanted to build. Beats Music is in a completely different league, with a deep set of features and content. It looks like an app that’s had years to mature, not a 1.0.</p>
<p>I’d like to see Apple get back to doing fewer things and doing them well. That means no TV or smartwatch. They need more product categories like photography, which they excel at. The iPhone camera is the best, the built-in Photos and Camera apps are great, and there’s a rich layer of third-party apps to fill in additional features. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoVW62mwSQQ">Apple’s photos ad</a> perfectly captures this.</p>
<p>Apple, fall in love with the next product category and lead us there. We’re ready for the next thing you <em>love</em>, not the next thing that Wall Street assumes everyone wants.</p>

<p>I agree. When AWS goes down now, it seems like half the internet doesn’t work. Except for a few lingering DNS entries, I moved everything from Amazon to Linode last year in a cost-cutting attempt.

			<p>If you’ve been reading my blog for a very long time, or listening to <a href="http://coreint.org/">my podcast</a>, you probably know that in addition to my business <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">Riverfold Software</a>, I also have a “regular” job at <a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/">VitalSource</a>. As that company has grown, I feel less comfortable blogging about my work there, since I can’t speak for the company or even the smaller group I directly work with.</p>
<p>But this month is my 13th anniversary (!) with VitalSource, so I thought it would be interesting to look back on the times I’ve blogged about my work there, and highlight some of things I’ve helped build.</p>
<p>One of the earlier posts, back in 2005, was <a href="http://manton.org/2005/08/vitalsource.html">about our new store</a>, where I linked to blog posts from James Duncan Davidson, Mike Clark, and Ryan Irelan about the project. But nearly a decade of migrating between blog systems has taken its toll; my post is still there, but the other links are all 404 not found.</p>
<p>Then from 2007, I wrote about <a href="../2007/01/bookshelf_note_sharing.html">syncing highlights and notes in e-books</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The architecture is based on the Simple Sharing Extensions (SSE) for RSS and OPML. On top of that we have added a VitalSource namespace and a few extra XML elements and attributes to keep track of Bookshelf-specific data, such as highlighter color and selected text within a book. The goal is to keep it as open as possible, so that in the future we can both consume other sources of user notes, and allow third-parties to also hook into the data in interesting ways.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>We recently updated the API to use a new, faster sync architecture, but the web app is still in use today. I’ve been updating it for Rails 4, a tedious process because of the Rails community’s fascination with deprecation.</p>
<p>Again in 2007, I mentioned updates to two of my favorite apps, MarsEdit 1.2 and NetNewsWire 3.0, along with <a href="../2007/06/new_software_releases.html">VitalSource Bookshelf 4.6</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “At VitalSource we also just released Bookshelf 4.6 today, which lays the foundation for media-rich textbooks and adds a highlighter rating UI for any subscribed highlighters you have. This data will bubble up in a few places in the future to allow you to discover people and books, although for now it’s one-way.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s neat looking back on this post because it includes a <a href="../screencasts/2007/bookshelf_rating.qt">short screencast of the app</a> from 2007, presumably running on Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger. The promise of this highlighter ratings feature never really materialized, though.</p>
<p>In 2010, <a href="../2010/03/ipad_ships_next.html">I thought about the iPad</a> right before its release:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I’m working on 2 apps for the iPad. The first is just a minor iPad refresh of an existing iPhone app at VitalSource called Bookshelf Noteview (iTunes link). It’s for reading notes and highlights synced from our e-book platform.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Noteview was eventually removed from sale. The other app I hinted at would become <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>.</p>
<p>Around the same time, <a href="http://manton.org/2010/03/mac_os_x_server.html">I blogged about Mac OS X</a> as a server platform:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “At VitalSource we now have a dozen Xserves running Ruby on Rails and a couple others running MySQL. While it’s mostly stable now, over the years there have been several mystery show-stopper problems that no one seems to have on other platforms.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously Apple no longer sells the Xserve. At VitalSource all our best new servers run Linux.</p>
<p>Also in 2010, <a href="http://manton.org/2010/08/congratulations.html">I reflected on how a team grows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “If you’re working by yourself and add another person to the project, a funny thing happens: you become a manager. Before, you could spend 100% of your time on the work. Now you can allocate 50-75%, because you’re getting the new programmer up to speed, answering questions, and setting priorities. If you’re lucky (and I usually am), the person you added is contributing so much that it easily makes up for your loss in productivity, and then some.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Later in 2010, I described how we <a href="../2010/09/bookshelf_touch.html">shipped Bookshelf for iPhone</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “At its core the app is 3 parts: a large C++ codebase, brand new Objective-C UI code, and a bunch of clever WebKit and JavaScript work. In many ways it’s a more difficult project than my other iPad app (still in development), but some great coders contributed to different parts of the architecture, before and after I joined the project.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are other posts, but I think these hit some of the more interesting milestones in the last 13 years. I also have an archive of earlier, company-internal blog posts, starting in 2001, that I hope to look into and publish pieces from one day.</p>

			<p>I’ve long been a fan of <a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a>, an iPhone app from my local Texas friends David Barnard and Justin Youens. It’s handy even for fairly simple tasks — firing off web searches or other shortcuts into apps — but it’s especially powerful when wiring up multiple apps together. For Sunlit it was nice to provide some full actions that Launch Center Pro users could use to automate bringing content into Sunlit.</p>
<p>Jonathan has <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/01/28/the-schemes-of-sunlit/">the full rundown on the URL schemes</a> that Sunlit supports and why we think they’re important. You can also use the Action Composer inside Launch Center Pro to access these actions without having to type them in.</p>
<p>And just today, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/launch-center-pro-for-ipad-review/">Launch Center Pro for iPad shipped</a>. Check it out and explore <a href="http://actions.contrast.co/">some of the many apps</a> like <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> that are supported.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://dancounsell.com/articles/paid-paymium-or-freemium">Dan Counsell has a great post about paid vs. freemium pricing</a> in the App Store, suggesting that paid apps are often still the best choice:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Launching as a paid app is still one of the most straightforward and safest ways to enter the App Store. Regardless of what you may have heard or read, the paid app market is not dead. As long as you’re smart with your marketing and price carefully you can make a great return on your initial investment.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m pretty sure we left some money on the table with our <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> launch by making it a free download. We had an audience of folks on App.net looking forward to picking it up, plus curious people who had signed up for our announcement mailing list, and others who would find out about it in <a href="../2014/01/press_for.html">the first week of press</a>. Many of these people upgraded to the full version inside the app, but I believe many more would have bought it for a few bucks even if the app ultimately wasn’t for them.</p>
<p>And that’s how the App Store works, right? People are always buying 99-cent apps they don’t need. It seems wrong, coming from a Mac background where you download the demo of an app and then pay a fair price after trying it, but so much of the iOS App Store works on cheap gimmicks and over-the-top marketing. People will buy on the promise of an app alone.</p>
<p>But we made Sunlit free anyway, for two reasons. First, because it requires an App.net account, we didn’t want anyone to buy it and then decide not to sign up for an App.net account, making the app they paid for worthless. It’s been great to see people sign up for App.net just to use the app, but we’re realistic enough to know that not everyone will do that.</p>
<p>Second, and most importantly, we have big plans for the app. Plans that include reaching people who don’t pay for apps often. I want my kids to be using this so that when we go on trips, all our best photos can sync to everyone’s device. I want extended family to use this, so that grandparents can stay in touch with what their children and grandchildren are up to. I want it to start free so that anyone can try it, because you never know who’s going to take the app and use it for something new, for ideas we haven’t even thought of.</p>
<p>Sunlit 1.0 is about laying the groundwork. I don’t want to change the price again, and our eye is on the market 6 months from now, a year from now. I think free with in-app purchase is the right approach for that.</p>

			<p>We’ve been really happy to see the reviews of Sunlit popping up around the web. With a new type of app like this, there’s always the risk that people won’t <em>get</em> it. But that hasn’t been a problem at all. I’ve included some quotes below.</p>
<p>Jon Russell on <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/01/18/sunlit-for-ios-is-a-neat-journaling-app-that-lets-you-easily-curate-and-share-photo-stories/">The Next Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The design is beautifully clean and the app is easy to navigate. [&#8230;] Sunlit is an easy way to curate a collection of images that you actually want to share.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Federico Viticci on <a href="http://www.macstories.net/linked/sunlit/">MacStories</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “You choose some photos that ‘tell a story’ – could be a trip, a family gathering, anything you want to remember – and the app pulls in their metadata for date and location. You can add text comments to jot down memories, import photos from Dropbox if you don’t keep them in the Camera Roll, and even add check-ins manually, from Foursquare, or from Steve Streza’s <a href="http://ohaiapp.net/">Ohai</a> app.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>John Gruber on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/01/22/sunlit">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Sunlit has an interesting collaboration and sync model, based on App.net, and a clever integration of maps. You can publish stories on the web, but most of the features are geared toward private group sharing and collaboration through the app.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thorin Klosowski on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/sunlit-automatically-makes-a-photo-journal-using-app-ne-1503461536">Lifehacker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The app itself is great looking and provides fantastic maps to go along with your photos as well as a place to write down any thoughts you might have.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Charlie Sorrel on <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/262817/sunlit-app-builds-photo-journals-using-dopbox-app-net-and-foursquare/">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Apps like Sunlit make sharing your pictures easy, fun and fast.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to everyone who tried the app and told people about it. Version 1.0.1 was approved this week, and you can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/sunlit/id690924901?mt=8">download it for free</a> and upgrade inside the app. Enjoy!</p>

<p>iOS already ships with a mapping framework from Apple that all apps can use, so why did we ignore it in <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> and use <a href="http://mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> instead? Two main reasons:</p>
<p><strong>Custom map colors.</strong> I was interested in creating beautiful new maps that would give Sunlit a unique design. Maps in every other iOS app look exactly the same. Sunlit is automatically more distinctive just by choosing something different, and we barely scratched the surface of the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/woodcut-inspired-map/">customization that is possible on Mapbox</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Direct web API.</strong> Mapbox gives you access to your maps not just in a native iOS map view, but also over the web. For the story backgrounds in Sunlit, we grab rendered maps directly with an HTTP call. This is a lot simpler and faster than having to build an interactive map view and snapshot it.</p>
<p>It also helped that I’ve been following the cool stuff Mapbox has been doing ever since <a href="http://codesorcery.net/2011/03/04/working-with-development-seed">Justin Miller joined their team</a> a few years ago. I could tell this was a company that wanted to push the technology of maps forward. Apple needs to spend all their time building a viable alternative to Google Maps — driving directions, business locations, better search. But I don’t care about any of those things in my app. For Sunlit I want to use a framework from people who clearly love maps, and I think that’s Mapbox.</p>

			<p>It was Macworld Expo in 1997, and Steve Jobs had just come back to Apple. Somehow I was lucky enough to get a seat in the keynote, and I sat there with a big grin on my face as Steve came out to talk about NeXTSTEP, which would eventually become the foundation for Mac OS X. He likened developing an app to constructing a building, one level at a time. A good OS allowed you to build higher.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s DOS gave you very little, so you had to start at the ground floor. Developing for the Mac and Windows was like starting out on a 5-story building. But the developer tools from NeXT were like starting out on the 20th floor, because they were so advanced, because they “lifted the developer up” and let apps be developed more quickly than if you had to deal with all the basic foundational stuff every app needs.</p>
<p>I think the App.net API is that same kind of advancement for apps compared to most other web APIs. It is significantly more consistent and full-featured than anything else out there.</p>
<p><a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> syncs stories and photos with App.net, using your App.net private file storage (for storing photo data) as well as private channels and messages (for syncing story titles, permissions, and other metadata). We like this solution because everyone who signs in to the app with their App.net credentials gets sync automatically. It also means that if you authorize other apps to see your App.net files, you can manage the data Sunlit syncs there, or get it out again without us having to directly build an export feature.</p>
<p>(Although we do offer a number of export choices in Sunlit, such as saving photos to your camera roll, sharing them on social networks, or sending them to any app that supports “Open In”. We do this <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/01/20/sharing-about-overshare/">with OvershareKit</a>.)</p>
<p>Publishing in Sunlit is another feature that utilizes App.net file storage. It allows you to take a story — photos and text — and publish it to a URL. The URL is public, but it’s not linked from anywhere unless you directly share the URL with someone. This makes it convenient for quickly publishing a set of photos and sending the link to family, for example.</p>
<p>Here’s what the published stories currently look like: <a href="http://sunlit.io/manton/nationalparks">http://sunlit.io/manton/nationalparks</a></p>
<p>On the surface this may look like Sunlit is uploading photos and other data to sunlit.io, where it’s probably stored in a relational database or on the server filesystem somewhere. But that’s not how it works at all.</p>
<p>The iPhone app actually uploads all photos to App.net file storage, marks the new files public, then generates a static HTML page and also uploads <em>that</em> to App.net. It then registers the story with sunlit.io, which caches the HTML just to make things a little faster. We never store any photos on sunlit.io itself, instead merely referencing their public URLs on App.net. (View source on the page to see the proof.)</p>
<p>This difference means you can move the site anywhere just by copying files from App.net, with any number of available <a href="https://directory.app.net/">file management tools</a>. Or just copy the HTML file to your own server to serve the page from your own domain. The CSS and JavaScript is all bundled inline in the HTML, except jQuery, which loads from a URL.</p>
<p>We think this approach makes the whole system a lot more flexible and open. Your data is never hidden inside the app and your published pages are never locked behind a server.</p>
<p>Several months ago <a href="../2013/08/waiting_for_appnets.html">I wrote this about App.net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The promise of App.net is bigger than one type of app. App.net isn’t just a blank slate; it’s an amplifier. It’s waiting to power the next new idea and help it grow into something big.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I still believe that. It’s making apps easier to build and more powerful, just like NeXTSTEP was. There’s really no other web platform like it. That’s why we picked it for Sunlit.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>We released <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> yesterday and the response has been really great. It’s so amazing to see all the replies on App.net, emails of encouragement, and tweets telling people about the app. I think 1.0 is off to an excellent start. We’ll keep making it better.</p>
<p>I was a little anxious about the release, though. It was a challenging app to build, and it’s different enough from other apps that it’s hard to predict how the market will react. I was also surprised that the same morning we shipped our app, <a href="https://www.storehouse.co/">Storehouse</a> was released. This is a beautiful iPad app from Mark Kawano and his new team. The interactions are extremely polished and it’s getting justifiably good praise and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/16/storehouse-an-apple-vet-tries-to-move-the-needle-on-long-form-visual-communication/">lengthy write-ups from Techcrunch</a> and elsewhere.</p>
<p>(Of course, we think Sunlit is pretty awesome too. I’ll be writing more about what makes it special in future blog posts, especially highlighting how it leverages the App.net API, the <a href="https://github.com/manton/sunlit/blob/master/urls.md">URL schemes support</a>, and why we use <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>.)</p>
<p>At first I was stunned by Storehouse. How could it be that we were both working on a similar idea for the last year, and both apps were finished at the same time? The apps have different UIs, and a different approach, maybe even different goals, but they both create stories, revolve around photos, and publish to the web. I’ve seen a lot of people compare the apps, and I think that’s fair.</p>
<p>To be honest, for a few minutes I was a little bummed out. If I had seen <a href="https://twitter.com/jacksonh/status/423906581516808192">this tweet from Jackson Harper</a> at the time, and not later in the day, I might have been nodding in agreement:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Having a somewhat similar free app from a funded developer launch the same day as you must be a little disappointing.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>That doesn’t really capture it, though, because I’m also really happy for the Storehouse team. I’ve known Mark for years. I’m confident that his app is going to be one of the most impressive apps on so many people’s iPads.</p>
<p>And they have a full-time team. Jon and I are just two guys, working in our spare time to build something — something <a href="../2014/01/why_we_built_sunlit.html">we think is new</a>, something <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/01/16/sunlit-is-for-me/">for us to use</a>, but also something ambitious in how big it could be.</p>
<p>It seems like a big coincidence that both apps shipped with a similar set of features, but now I realize why it happened. Sure, it’s funny that the release days were identical, and not a few days or weeks apart. But the general timing shouldn’t be at all surprising, because <em>this is an idea whose time has come</em>. There are photo “album”-type apps popping up all over the App Store, such as Cluster, Albumatic, and Heyday, all of which Apple has featured. Plus there are web-based apps like Exposure and Medium, which was recently updated with great photo support as well.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence; it’s just a good idea. And it’s a huge market: everyone who loves writing and taking photos. That understanding gives me a lot of confidence to double down on our plans for Sunlit 1.1, 1.2, and after. 2014 is going to be an awesome year for sharing stories.</p>

<p>You have that feeling when hanging out with friends — everyone snapping pictures of their surroundings, of people, events, food, anything — that <em>photo sharing should be better</em>. That years later, you should be able to go back to that time, to see the best photos collected together from several people. And not just photos, but maps of where you were, and text to describe its significance.</p>
<p>One afternoon before Çingleton in 2012, this subject came up as Jonathan Hays and I were taking photos around Montreal. It seemed remarkable and disappointing to us that there was no easy way to put those photos together. And I liked the idea of buildling a new app around photos, with the same themes of curation and preserving past events that are so important to my other Riverfold products.</p>
<p>So we let the idea sit in the back of our minds, and later we wrote a little code as time allowed. At <a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/06/11/app-net-hackathon-recap-2/">the App.net hackathon before WWDC 2013</a> we dove into the project in earnest, figuring out how it would sync, then over the summer took some more time to think through the user experience.</p>
<p>Sharing a single photo has been done a hundred times on iOS. Instagram was an important app to nail the timeline UI, and <a href="http://favd.net/">Favd</a> is currently my favorite way to post and browse new photos (it’s really great). But hardly anyone has even attempted to tackle photo curation, group sharing, and publishing, let alone gotten it right. Sunlit 1.0 is our first pass at this and we couldn’t be more excited about trying to solve a new problem with photos.</p>
<p>They say you should spend money on experiences — on memories, not things. Sunlit helps you put those memories together, share them as a group, and rediscover them when it matters. The first version <a href="http://sunlit.io/">will ship tomorrow</a>. I hope you like it.</p>

			<p><a href="http://successfulsoftware.net/2014/01/10/new-shiny-thing/">Andy Brice had a good post recently</a> about shipping:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Continually abandoning work in progress for a new idea is also a form of cowardice. If I never ship, then I can’t fail. But I can’t succeed either. And I won’t learn anything useful from a string of half-finished products that never shipped.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been reminding myself of this to combat any self-doubt as <a href="https://alpha.app.net/cheesemaker">Jon</a> and I prepare <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> 1.0 for release. There is plenty to worry about: bugs we might have missed, potential confusion about how sync works, whether free with in-app purchase was the right call. But I’m proud that we took an idea from well over a year ago, prototyped it, rewrote it, and refined it, finally building it into an app that will ship.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I’ve been slowly moving photos to Dropbox over the last year, using the Dropbox camera import feature so that all new photos from my phone get synced up automatically. It’s worked out so well that last week I decided to go all in. I moved about 13 years of photos there and upgraded to Dropbox’s 200 GB of storage.</p>
<p>In the process I’ve been poking around at old photos, photos of my kids from 6-7 years ago when we had a basic point-and-shoot camera. There are some great photos in there, but also so many that are blurry or out of focus. We were too cheap to buy a good camera at the time. Now I would pay any amount of money to go back in time and reshoot the photos with a better camera.</p>
<p><a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2013/12/so_i_got_my_first_dslr.html">Gus Mueller learned this lesson</a> more quickly than I did:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It’s quite amazing what a difference a nice lens and a nice camera can do. Kirstin was shocked at the quality. The cameras on iPhones are getting better, but they don’t hold a candle to camera tech today.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>We don’t use our DSLR every day. It’s for big events, birthdays, school performances, and the iPhone suffices for the rest of the time. But it’s worth every penny and more, to look back on these photos years later and know we have captured them at their best.</p>
<p>Photos are also at the heart of my new app, <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a>. We’ll be shipping soon. Enter your email address on the site to be notified when it hits the App Store.</p>

			<p><a href="http://nickbradbury.com/2013/12/20/glassboard-finds-a-home/">Nick Bradbury on selling Glassboard</a> to Second Gear:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “When finding a new owner was first discussed, I was very unsure of the idea. We wouldn’t be just handing over our software to someone else – we’d also be handing over our customers and their data. That was such a concern of mine that I suggested we simply kill the product.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>A few times this year I’ve thought about whether I should sell Tweet Marker, but it usually comes back to a similar concern as what Nick says above. I wouldn’t feel comfortable selling it to most companies that would actually want to acquire it. So I’ve made <a href="../2013/07/announcing_the_tweet.html">a change</a> or <a href="http://manton.org/2013/11/tweet_marker.html">two</a>, and we’ll see how 2014 goes.</p>
<p>As for Glassboard, I’m excited to see <a href="http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/blog/glassboard-acquired-by-second-gear/">what Justin Williams does with it</a>. We use it for Core Intuition questions and feedback (invite code “coreint”), and I’m sure I’ll be using the 3.0 version around conferences next year.</p>

			<p>In the 90s I bought a LaserDisc player because it was the best way to get bonus features like director’s commentary and “making of” shorts on some of my favorite movies, before DVDs took off. But I’ve resisted getting a Blu-ray player, even though studios seem to have completely shut out DVDs from the behind-the-scenes material we’re used to. Luckily artists can still share their work directly via the web.</p>
<p>I love this new site from Pixar artists, just in time for the holidays, on <a href="http://www.theblueumbrellamakingofholidaycalendar.com/">the making of their short film The Blue Umbrella</a>. It’s presented as a holiday calendar with a new page revealed each day. From day 3:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The second test I had made after having just been to a concert of Sarah Jaffe. I fell in love with her music and voice and desperately wanted to pitch her an idea for a music video. But I needed a concept for it. While walking through the city and listing to her songs I suddenly got this idea for a music video where a whole city would sing one of her songs.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s one of those rare sites that is so wonderful that I make an exception to not following it if there’s no RSS feed. Added to my bookmarks.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Apple has produced some amazing ads over the years. 1984, introducing the original Mac; the Think Different campaign; and one of my favorite this year, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoVW62mwSQQ">about photos</a>.</p>
<p>Their new ad “Misunderstood” is also great. <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-airs-iphone-5s-holiday-commercial-featuring-airplay/">Federico Viticci has a rundown</a> of the details and how brilliantly it unfolds. I first noticed the video via Neven Mrgan, who had <a href="https://alpha.app.net/mrgan/post/17528712">this to say on App.net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Apple’s new ad (‘Misunderstood’) is technically perfect: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImlmVqH_5HM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImlmVqH_5HM</a> …but I have to say it doesn’t quite ring true to me. Kids use iPhones to shut out the family and hang out within their own social circle (and that’s ok).”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s right. My daughters will likely escape to Instagram and various chat apps to connect with their friends through the holidays. But also I think ads like this work so well not because they represent reality, not because they’re true, but because we want them to be.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I wrote a draft of this post a couple weeks ago while on the road, then gave a summary on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2013/11/episode-115-all-day-at-the-magic-kingdom/">Core Intuition 115</a>. But I still wanted to publish it and give a little more detail about my experience with cellular on the iPad.</p>
<p>I ordered my retina iPad Mini with T-Mobile, hoping to take advantage of their free 200 MB of data per month. Since most of the time I’m at home on wi-fi, I figured the savings for all the months that I don’t need even 200 MB would more than offset the extra $130 cost of buying the cellular version of iPad.</p>
<p>I had three primary use cases in mind: the occasional commute on the train to work at coffee shops downtown, when it’s nice to be connected but the train wi-fi doesn’t cut it; swim meets and other kid activities with very long downtime, again without need for a laptop but it might be nice to catch up on some writing or RSS feeds; and road trips, lonely stretches of the highway where I’m technically on vacation but still need to check in on email, chat, or App.net.</p>
<p>I got home from the Apple Store, excitedly opened the box, restored my iPad from iCloud, tapped to set up a new T-Mobile plan, and&#8230; immediately wished I had chosen Verizon instead. Because the first thing I saw was an error that the web site wasn’t working. T-Mobile is smallest of the big carriers, and the error made me doubt that T-Mobile had the coverage or competence to make this work.</p>
<p>I followed up the poor first impression by searching the internet for similar problems that other T-Mobile customers might have run into. Sure enough, it was common weeks earlier during the iPad Air rollout, and T-Mobile still hadn’t fixed it. The workaround was simply to disable wi-fi during setup, forcing the connection to go through T-Mobile’s network.</p>
<p>A week later I gave the network its first real test on the road. Checking email, looking up maps and directions, writing, even a little streaming video for the kids.</p>
<p>The coverage between major cities wasn’t good. The iPad Mini was often on Edge where my iPhone 4S on AT&amp;T had 4G. It worked, but would frequently drop and reconnect. Sometimes I’d get lucky and find a spot of LTE for a little while, and it was a beautiful thing, while it lasted. Other times it was all but unusable.</p>
<p>The good news is that “200 MB free” is not a marketing gimmick. No strings attached, no credit card required, and no phone plan needed; it really is free cell data. The cost is dealing with a company that wants desperately to “get” iOS but isn’t quite there, and poor connectivity between cities compared to AT&amp;T. But after a rough start, I have no regrets. I’m typing this on my iPad along I-10 somewhere between Austin and Orlando, and that’s priceless indeed.</p>
