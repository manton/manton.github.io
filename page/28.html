			<p>With every day since <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api">Twitter’s new rules</a> were announced, my opinion grows stronger that this is the end of the platform as we’ve known it for the last few years. It hurts that <a href="http://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/">so much of what was pioneered by the developer community</a> has been co-opted and trademarked and turned against developers. Nothing will change tomorrow; we can expect new versions of Tweetbot, Twitterrific, and my own app Tweet Library. But in the long run it’s a dead-end.</p>
<p>Lex Friedman, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1168222/twitter_app_makers_trying_to_figure_out_the_future.html">writing for Macworld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Some developers are notably hesitant to speak on the record, lest they incur Twitter’s wrath; the fear seems to be that since Twitter is now exerting more control than ever over access to its API—which developers leverage to make their Twitter apps work—that irking Twitter too much might result in a developer’s API access getting revoked.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I have less at stake than developers with popular mainstream apps, so in a way I feel it’s my duty to speak out when it’s warranted, where others can’t. I’m quoted in <a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/08/21/twitter-secured/">Matthew Panzarino’s article</a> on the Twitter API change, and I was <a href="http://www.kqed.org/news/story/2012/08/20/105989/new_twitter_rules_restrict_app_development_sales?category=bay+area">interviewed for a radio spot on San Francisco’s KQED</a>.</p>
<p>I could live with some of the API changes. I could live with the display requirements, even the user caps. Maybe I could live in a developer-hostile environment, finding a market niche far below Twitter’s radar. Except for two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Timeline integrity”</strong>: The display guidelines say you can’t mix other content in a timeline of tweets. You can’t easily have a multi-platform app that shows both App.net posts and Twitter tweets in the same view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trademarks</strong>: You are allowed to use “Tweet” in the name of your app, but only if Twitter is the only service you support. You can’t add Facebook or App.net or Heello support alongside Twitter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are anti-competitive and unworkable. So I’ve decided to spin off Tweet Marker Plus, my paid web-based app that builds on top of the Tweet Marker sync engine. I’ll relaunch it with a new name, slowly introducing new features that aren’t tied exclusively to Twitter. For a hint of where it’s going, you can <a href="https://alpha.app.net/manton">follow me on App.net</a>.</p>

			<p>Dave Winer reiterates that <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/08/16/privatizingAndSocializing.html">we must plan now to preserve our online writing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “There were far fewer bloggers. Maybe thousands. Today there are millions. None of them are thinking about what happens when Tumblr or Blogger or WordPress or Facebook disappear. But come on — we almost know for certain that one of them will. Given enough time they will all disappear.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>These companies are only as strong and permanent as their leaders, and leadership doesn’t last. If you think it can’t happen soon, look at the new Digg. Although <a href="http://digg.com/archive">they want to export the previous content</a>, currently nothing from Digg’s 7-year history is accessible. Not by accident, not by catastrophic failure, but because no one at the new company cared to keep it around.</p>

			<p>Amy Hoy writes about master craftsmen and <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2012/why-blacksmiths-are-better-at-startups-than-you/">being accountable to your real customers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “When you live and work in an insulated life — divorced from the end result of your work — <strong>you are spoiled</strong>. You’re graded more on your ability to please and manage gatekeepers than your work product. Gatekeepers are human; humans can be persuaded to accept excuses.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Just enough separation from customers is healthy — email and tweets, instead of phone calls. But put up too many walls, too much bureaucracy, and you might no longer care who you’re building the software for. You might forget why it has to be great.</p>

			<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> turns 10 years old today. I love <a href="http://distantshape.com/df10/">this visualization of the posts</a> from those years. You can view by article length and highlight posts for certain topics.</p>
<p>There’s a rich history of posts in the archive. Like the best blogs, there’s consistency in design, tone, and format. None of the URLs have ever changed.</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorite essays.</p>
<p>June 4, 2004, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/broken_windows">Broken Windows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Arguing that it’s technically possible that the Mac could suffer just as many security exploits as Windows is like arguing that a good neighborhood could suddenly find itself strewn with garbage and plagued by vandalism and serious crime. Possible, yes, but not likely.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>April 20, 2006, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/04/initiative">Initiative</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “What I’ve concluded, though, is that if I want to make a full-time income from Daring Fireball, I need to just do it full-time. I.e. that it’s not going to work the other way around — to wait for the revenue to burgeon and <em>then</em> start putting full-time effort into it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>August 4, 2006, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/08/highly_selective">Highly Selective</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I’m sure there are other examples of Mac apps that offer anchored list selection, but the point remains that the vast majority of software now follows Apple’s lead and uses the unanchored model for list item selection. If ‘Mac-like’ means ‘what most other Mac software does’, then in this case the Mac-like behavior is wrong, or at the very least, worse.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>October 2, 2008, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/10/the_fear">The Fear</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “But this pitch also worked because it was true. All three of those products sound good on their own. All three in one device sounds insanely great. Jobs was introducing the iPhone simply by describing precisely what it was.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>April 24, 2009, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/04/twitter_clients_playground">Twitter Clients Are a UI Design Playground</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I read web sites and email and RSS feeds on my iPhone, but Twitter is the one service where reading on my iPhone doesn’t feel constrained compared to reading on my Mac.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>June 26, 2009, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/06/copy_and_paste">Copy and Paste</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “That we had to wait two years for the iPhone’s text selection and pasteboard is a good example of one aspect of the Apple way: better nothing at all than something less than great.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>January 27, 2010, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/ipad_big_picture">The iPad Big Picture</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Software aside (which is a huge thing to put aside), it may well be that no other company could make a device today matching the price, size, and performance of the iPad. They’re not getting into the CPU business for kicks, they’re getting into it to kick ass.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>August 24, 2011, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/08/resigned">Resigned</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The same thought, care, and painstaking attention to detail that Steve Jobs brought to questions like ‘How should a computer work?’, ‘How should a phone work?’, ‘How should we buy music and apps in the digital age?’ he also brought to the most important question: ‘How should a company that creates such things function?’”
</p></blockquote>
<p>December 25, 2011, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/12/merry">Merry</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “— how much will I be willing to pay then to be able to go back in time, for one day, to now, when he’s eight years old, he wants to go to movies and play games and build Lego kits with me, and he believes in magic?”
</p></blockquote>
<p>February 16, 2012, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/02/mountain_lion">Mountain Lion</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “This is an awful lot of effort and attention in order to brief what I’m guessing is a list of a dozen or two writers and journalists. It’s Phil Schiller, spending an entire week on the East Coast, repeating this presentation over and over to a series of audiences of one.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Congrats John. Here’s to the next 10 years.</p>

				<a href="../2012/08/appnets_great_start.html" rel="bookmark">App.net&#8217;s great start</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Today, <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/we-did-it">App.net passed its $500,000 funding goal</a>. A few weeks ago when I signed up with my $50, I didn&#8217;t think they could do it. And Daniel and I were both pessimistic about their chances when we talked about it on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2012/07/episode-50-dont-get-too-attached/">Core Intuition 50</a>.</p>
<p>In less than a month, they went from a mission statement video that seemed just a step away from vaporware, to following through on an API spec and then alpha version web site. They delivered. The momentum of <em>shipping something real</em> brought in new users and drove them to the finish.</p>
<p>What I love most about App.net is the transparency. Founder Dalton Caldwell is a blogger, like one of us. Where we only hear from Twitter&#8217;s CEO, Dick Costolo, through big news publications or at conference keynotes, for Dalton we hear it directly from his own blog posts, the way a small company should communicate. Being on the ground in posts and tweets is a perfect complement to his goal of treating users and developers as real customers.</p>
<p>App.net will never overtake Twitter. Look no further than hashtags all over the Olympics as proof of that. But App.net can put pressure on Twitter to respect third-party developers, and with thousands of paying customers, all with a vested interest in making App.net something worthwhile, App.net has already surpassed every other Twitter clone that has tried and failed to build a community.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html">Paul Graham&#8217;s essay on ambitious startup ideas</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers use. A search engine whose users consisted of the top 10,000 hackers and no one else would be in a very powerful position despite its small size, just as Google was when it was that search engine. […]</p>
<p>  &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry if something you want to do will constrain you in the long term, because if you don&#8217;t get that initial core of users, there won&#8217;t be a long term. If you can just build something that you and your friends genuinely prefer to Google, you&#8217;re already about 10% of the way to an IPO, just as Facebook was (though they probably didn&#8217;t realize it) when they got all the Harvard undergrads.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s talking about search engines, but it could be anything. Get those 10,000 passionate users and you have a chance to take on the giants in the industry. As of this writing, App.net has 8000 paying customers. And 25% of them signed up at the developer tier. I&#8217;m sure every developer with a popular Twitter app has already looked at the App.net API documentation.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/234709098124414976">John Siracusa tweeted</a> after App.net successfully funded: &#8220;Now comes the hard part.&#8221; Totally true, but just reaching this point was difficult — a perfect mix of great timing and even better execution. In the first 30 days, we saw a team that knows how to win. Let&#8217;s see what they can do next.</p>

			<p><a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/08/day-one-review/">Shawn Blanc reviews the latest version of Day One</a>, which now supports photos:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Over the years, most of the major, monumental milestones of life were documented in my Moleskine. But not all. And that’s why I’m glad to have an app that let’s me easily and joyfully add a snapshot or a quick note about an important or memorable event. These are the things my family and I will look back on 20 and 30 years from now with great fondness.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>While <a href="../2012/07/journals.html">I keep the important stuff in my journals</a>, I also use a protected Twitter account for the everyday notes and photos while away from the house. It has no followers; it&#8217;s just to have a date-stamped entry with a photo that&#8217;s easy to sync. Now that I&#8217;ve read how people are using Day One for this, I&#8217;m going to switch away from my private Twitter account to use Day One on the iPhone instead.</p>
<p>I like having one place for this kind of stuff. If the same type of content is scattered across multiple services, it makes it less likely that everything will be together in the future when I finally want it.</p>
<p>Especially interesting to me from Shawn&#8217;s review is that he also keeps a hand-written journal, even after using Day One for a similar purpose. I&#8217;ll keep using real-world pen and paper too, and everything I write there I will also transcribe into Day One. But I&#8217;ll write new things in Day One that will stay exclusively digital.</p>
<p>Federico Viticci <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/review-the-new-day-one/">also has a great review</a>. He starts with the big picture, the why of writing it all down:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I don’t even know if I’ll be around in twenty years. But I do know that I want to do everything I can to make sure I can get there with my own memories. We are what we know. And I want to remember.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the best writers know that it matters what their work looks like in a decade, or two decades, whether the writing is private or public. You can see it in everything from permanent URLs to blog topics to what software they use — a conscious effort to create content that lasts.</p>

			<p>Steve Corona <a href="http://stevecorona.com/on-keeping-a-journal">on keeping a journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “And for the past 1091 days, I’ve been journaling every single day — that’s about 3 years or 12% of my entire life. My only regret? I wish I started sooner.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>When I was younger, I had tried off and on to keep a sketchbook or journal, but it never quite stuck. Like blogging, or writing, or drawing, or anything you aren&#8217;t paid to do, it takes setting a routine. There&#8217;s always something more important to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://instagr.am/p/Kf0zpaCbwH/"><img src="http://distilleryimage7.s3.amazonaws.com/5931b2b29b9b11e1abb012313813106f_7.jpg" width="150" height="150" align="right" style="border: 1px solid darkgray; margin: 8px;" alt="journals" /></a> Then in 1998, I started a journal again with a renewed commitment. I filled a book from that day up until I got married. Then another book through when my daughters were born. Another for the first 10 years of their life, and my son&#8217;s. The travel, the big life moments, the election, the work. It&#8217;s not everything — sometimes the entries are every day and sometimes months go by with nothing — but it&#8217;s the stuff that matters, and the snapshots in time of little everyday things too.</p>
<p>I would be devastated to lose these books. Open the pages and it rolls back the years like a time machine, to a previous life full of small details that are priceless today. I&#8217;m writing the books half for my terrible fading memory, and half for my children, who will only care what these years have been like when it&#8217;s too late to ask me.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve recently started transcribing the handwritten entries into digital form. One page at a time, into <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a>, then exported as plain text. It&#8217;s a long and tedious process, but multiple copies are the only sure way to make something last.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last year I had to migrate the news blog section of the <a href="http://www.staple-austin.org/">Staple! site</a> from an ancient version of Movable Type (version 2.x) to Blogger. Even though Blogger has recently dropped features and seems mostly deprecated in favor of Google+, for this site there were a ton of existing users on Blogger. Upgrading just made sense.</p>
<p>However, what a file format mess. Export in Movable Type&#8217;s custom text format; import in Blogger&#8217;s Atom format. So first step is to find a service that&#8217;ll convert between the two, then manually fix up usernames so it imports properly. I exported, tweaked, and imported this file at least a dozen times before getting it right.</p>
<p>I was so frustrated because this wasn&#8217;t just accidental bugs. Developers made conscious choices that led us to this compatibility dead-end. They <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kellan/7354863752/in/photostream">bet against Dave Winer and lost</a> at a pivotal time in the development of blogging.</p>
<p>We had a format that was perfect for both blog syndication and as an interchange format between systems: RSS. Instead, some developers criticized RSS, then proceeded to create new products that have not been well cared for.</p>
<p>That is now part of their legacy. 10 years after blogging went mainstream, the end result of reinventing the wheel isn&#8217;t better software, it&#8217;s user frustration trying to get anything to work together.</p>
<p>This lesson keeps playing out, as if we&#8217;re doomed to repeat it with each new generation of file formats. Here&#8217;s this week&#8217;s post from Eran Hammer <a href="http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/oauth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/">declaring OAuth 2.0 a failed format</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The web does not need yet another security framework. It needs simple, well-defined, and narrowly suited protocols that will lead to improved security and increased interoperability. OAuth 2.0 fails to accomplish anything meaningful over the protocol it seeks to replace.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have a choice, always pick the old boring format that works above the new hotness that is only theoretically better.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>This is kind of a short, technical footnote to <a href="../2012/07/permanence.html">my last essay</a>. There I linked to an older blog post from Dave Winer, just one of many of his on this subject. Today <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/07/20/moreOnLocAndTwitter.html">he writes how we should archive blogs</a> before we worry about Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With Twitter there’s a rich corporation minding it. They can and imho should be funding their own archive. But with the historic blogosphere, dating back to the early-mid 90s, <em>a lot of it is already gone</em>. The need to preserve it, by independent historians and librarians, is greater than the need for Twitter to be publicly archived.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a lot to say on this, and I can&#8217;t wait to share a new web project that I started recently which could play a small roll in blog backups. When I killed off my little app Wii Transfer, I did so to <a href="../2012/05/saying_goodbye_to.html">refocus Riverfold around preservation</a>. I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It also doesn’t fit into a new theme I have for Riverfold: apps that are all about keeping and remembering what matters. For Clipstart, that’s family videos. For Tweet Library and Tweet Marker Plus, that’s old tweets.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Dave mentions libraries several times in his blog post. It’s no accident that the word “library” is in Tweet Library’s name; my ambition for this app far outpaces my coding speed. But blogs are a different problem, and they need something special — perhaps multiple solutions.</p>

			<p>Nothing lasts on the internet. I could write on my weblog for years and the next day get hit by a bus. The domain expires, the posts are lost, and it doesn&#8217;t matter if I had 10 readers or 10,000; it&#8217;s as if it never happened.</p>
<p>I love real books. I keep flirting with attempts to catalog our bookshelves over the years. My daughter offered to help once, excited through the first hundred books before she realized the rest would take all day and lost interest.</p>
<p>Some people say “good riddance” to the cheap printed book, but I don&#8217;t agree. Recently in our house I found a paperback of an old favorite, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tigana-Guy-Gavriel-Kay/dp/0451457765">Tigana</a>, which I had bought while traveling in Europe. Inside the cover I had written “Oxford, 1999”. I flipped through the pages and out fell a wine label that I hadn&#8217;t seen in 13 years. It was from a bottle of wine my wife and I had in Greece, sitting on the sand of an island beach the night I proposed.</p>
<p>I had kept it back then because I knew years later it would matter — a memory fused into a piece of paper, waiting. That trip was a story told in events like that one, in personal journals, and through email to family. The digital parts of the story didn&#8217;t last; <a href="../2002/07/yahoo_mail.html">the email is gone</a>.</p>
<p>Write on Twitter and it vanishes from the internet after 3200 more such posts, unlinked and unfindable. But write the same on a scrap of paper tucked into a book and it will be rediscovered again years later.</p>
<p>A self-published novel in PDF on your web site is a ticking time bomb, waiting for your hosting bill to go unpaid. But print 10 copies and give it to 10 friends and it lasts forever.</p>
<p>The only way to preserve something is to make multiple copies and distribute them. The problem with digital is that it makes it just as easy to accidentally delete or lose copies as it is to create them. Evolving file formats and storage devices require constant supervision and maintenance, pushing files up each technology bump from floppies to CDs to Zip disks to DVDs to hard drives. It never ends.</p>
<p>We need to solve this. It&#8217;s something <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/01/10/nytOnFuturesafeArchives.html">Dave Winer has written about</a>. It&#8217;s something anyone with a large collection of writing online probably thinks about. How do we preserve the culture and art and stories of our time when the preferred media is so fragile?</p>

			<p>Despite <a href="../2012/05/clipstart_142.html">everything I said</a> about how easy it would be for customers to upgrade from the Mac App Store version of Clipstart to the direct download version, in the real world this doesn&#8217;t appear to be working well for some customers.

<p>After the first few emails came in, I automated this with <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/upgrade/">a simple form</a> that customers can fill out.

			<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/07/18/adobe-sponsorship-and-credibility">Marco Arment has a strong post</a> on how sponsorships won&#8217;t change his writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “If a sponsor ever has a problem with something I write, and that affects pending or future sponsorship buys, <em>that’s fine with me</em>. I can find other sponsors. And if I can’t, I’ll write for free, like I did for years.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>This was part of a theme on <a href="http://coreint.org/49">today&#8217;s Core Intuition episode</a> as well, not just sponsorships but also whether having an audience changes how we write tweets and blog posts. Daniel Jalkut and I have been very lucky with Core Intuition so far to have great sponsors: apps and events we already love like Marco&#8217;s own Instapaper, Smile&#8217;s TextExpander, CocoaConf, iDeveloper TV, NSConference, and Glassboard. Eventually we&#8217;ll be approached by more apps and services that we don&#8217;t have as much experience with, but as long as we keep our voice and honesty, I&#8217;m not too worried.</p>

			<p>Gabe at Macdrifter comments on <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/07/1password-on-the-mac-app-store/">the shift back to direct download for 1Password</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I recall the <a href="http://forum.agilebits.com/index.php?/topic/8048-1password-only-from-app-store/">massive forum discussion</a> about the decision to take 1Password MAS only. I converted to the MAS version in March to get on-board with their product roadmap. Now I see that <a href="https://agilebits.com/store">it is available again as a direct download purchase</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/roustem">@roustem</a> confirms it will <a href="https://twitter.com/roustem/statuses/224965704015810560">receive the next update soon</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve never liked the idea of being exclusive to the Mac App Store. I don&#8217;t think any of those transitions — from 1Password to Pixelmator — were good for users, especially when customers had to re-purchase a product they already owned. I hope sandboxing will at least make more developers think twice about pinning their business to the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>The blog post continues with this point, and all the good and bad that comes with it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;This is the MAS as I see it: It is not for utility apps or power users. Apps like 1Password, TextExpander and Keyboard Maestro should all be purchased directly from the developers site. The MAS is for people afraid of using a computer.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words: it&#8217;s good for some users and some apps, and not others. And that&#8217;s okay. I have no regrets about pulling <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart</a> from the Mac App Store. I think of my app as pretty easy to use, but it&#8217;s for people who get file systems and tagging and uploads. Most definitely <em>not</em> for people afraid of using a computer.</p>

Tweet Marker Plus now grabs your favorites from Twitter so that they&#8217;re included in the searchable archive. The UI is better too, so you can tell at a glance what tweets have been favorited, and a new sidebar link can show just your recent favorites.</p>
<p>A few days ago was the 3-month anniversary of Tweet Marker Plus&#8217;s launch. This is a significant milestone for me because all the early subscriptions were only billed once every 3 months. For most subscribers, this week is the first time recurring billing will have kicked in. (New subscribers are on monthly billing, which is a lot simpler for customers to understand and for me to predict.)</p>
<p>I also rolled out some other fixes tonight, and improved performance for how background tasks run. <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/plus">Enjoy</a>.</p>

			<p>It usually takes a couple problems hitting at once to cause a major server outage. This happened last week when Tweet Marker&#8217;s SSL certificate expired. I have the SSL set to auto-renew, but it still requires manually installing the new certificate, and other problems happened along the way.</p>
<p>First mistake: I didn&#8217;t realize it was expiring. Those emails go to an account I don&#8217;t check very often, littered with spam. And the email to confirm the renewal went to yet another email address that no longer worked. When I had moved the DNS hosting to Amazon&#8217;s Route 53, I had neglected to move over the MX records.</p>
<p>After fixing all of that, I tried updating the app on Heroku to use the new cert, only to get stalled as Heroku&#8217;s new SSL add-on rejected it. Certain I had done something wrong, I fumbled through a dozen Heroku SSL how-to posts before finally reverting to their old SSL add-on. It&#8217;s no longer documented and is in fact actively discouraged by Heroku, but it also has the lucky trait of <em>actually working</em> with my certificate. Updating DNS caused another hour-long delay because of the high TTL.</p>
<p>I sent two support requests during this process, so I thought I&#8217;d rate how each company did:</p>
<ul>
<li>DreamHost: Before I figured out the bad email address, I sent DreamHost a question about why the SSL certificate hadn&#8217;t showed up yet. They responded very quickly, and even included a &#8220;P.S.&#8221; that they were fans of Tweet Marker. Basically they provided excellent support, the best you could ask for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heroku: When the new SSL add-on wasn&#8217;t accepting my certificate, I filed a support request with Heroku as well. The response was an automated reply that they don&#8217;t do support past 6pm. For a hosting company that charges a premium, this was a disappointing response. (They responded first thing the next morning, though.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This SSL glitch was the only significant outage Tweet Marker has had in its first year. I learned a few lessons, took the opportunity to check backups and EC2 servers, and now I&#8217;m ready to move on. Hoping for an even better year 2.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Excellent piece from Joel Spolsky yesterday on <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/07/09.html">software inventory and bug databases</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The trouble is that 90% of the things in the feature backlog will never get implemented, ever. So every minute you spent writing down, designing, thinking about, or discussing features that are never going to get implemented is just time wasted. When I hear about product teams that regularly have ‘backlog grooming’ sessions, in which they carefully waste a tiny amount of time and mental energy every day or every week thinking about every single feature which will never be implemented, I want to poke my eyes out.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of the original Getting Real from 37signals. <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Forget_Feature_Requests.php">Back in 2006</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “So what do you do with all these requests that pour in? Where do you store them? <strong>How do you manage them? You don’t. Just read them and then throw them away.</strong>”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It sounds blasphemous but the ones that are important will keep bubbling up anyway. Those are the only ones you need to remember. Those are the truly essential ones. Don’t worry about tracking and saving each request that comes in. Let your customers be your memory. If it’s really worth remembering, they’ll remind you until you can’t forget.”
</p></blockquote>

			<p>When I launched Tweet Marker Plus, I documented that it would store &#8220;about a month&#8221; of tweets. I didn&#8217;t want to promise too much before I fully understood the storage requirements. After a few weeks, I officially bumped it up to &#8220;at least 2 months&#8221;. I also added a full archive of your own tweets, which are never deleted.</p>
<p>The truth is I&#8217;ve yet to write the code that actually deletes any tweets from the database and search index. Eventually I&#8217;ll have to, but not yet. So I&#8217;ll continue to evolve the service in a way that makes it more useful and sustainable.</p>
<p>Recently I increased the $2/month price to $5/month, with the search index expanded to 3 months of tweets. Today I&#8217;m officially bumping the storage again, to 6 months of tweets. I&#8217;ve also changed to monthly billing instead of once every 3 months. Everyone who already has the $2/month plan will get to keep it. No price increase for you, and you still get the new 6-month storage and new features, as a thank-you for being an early subscriber.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve added a major new feature. You can now create custom collections of tweets and publish them to share with others. This is a feature from my iOS app Tweet Library, and in fact any published collection from Tweet Library will also show up in Tweet Marker Plus. New in Tweet Marker, you have the option of keeping a collection private or making it linkable, without it showing up when someone browses the list of collections.</p>
<p><a href="http://tweetmarker.net/plus/account">The screenshots linked on the account page</a> include an example of how collections work.</p>
<p>As a bonus for Mac users, there&#8217;s also a new menubar search app. This little Mac app hides in the menubar and gives quick access to searching your Tweet Marker Plus timeline and archive. <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetmarker/screenshots/menu_search.png">Here&#8217;s a screenshot</a> of what version 1.0 looks like.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Today I released <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart 1.5</a> for direct download customers and removed the previous version of Clipstart from the Mac App Store. Even though I&#8217;ve written about leaving the Mac App Store several times, actually pulling the trigger was difficult. But I believe it&#8217;s the right thing for my app, right now.</p>
<p>Clipstart 1.5 is still $29. Changes for this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now requires Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. Please do not upgrade to this version if you are running 10.5 or 10.6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added &#8220;Consolidate&#8221; command for finding videos that have not been imported or duplicates outside the library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added AppleScript support for uploading videos. See the help menu for scripting examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved performance throughout the app, especially with importing and refreshing video thumbnails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved error message when failing to import all videos from a camera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed tags field on Add Folder dialog not resetting tags value after an import.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion&#8217;s Gatekeeper security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been thinking about buying Clipstart but were on the fence before, I&#8217;ll throw in a discount for you. Use coupon code MANTONBLOG to save 20%.</p>

			<p>Since I follow <a href="http://twitter.com/sketchcrawl">Enrico Casarosa on Twitter</a>, I&#8217;ve been hearing about La Luna for what seems like a year. I was so happy to finally see the film run in front of Brave last weekend. Beautifully done and possibly my favorite Pixar short, perfect for a short film. (As an added bonus for seeing it at Alamo Drafthouse, they ran 7 other Pixar shorts before the feature started.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s so much interesting work possible with short films. Disney apparently has another great one up their sleeves in Paperman. <a href="http://billdesowitz.com/disney-delivers-game-changing-paperman-short/">Some of the early hype</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;From what they told me and from what I&#8217;ve glimpsed in these concept drawings and videos below, it could be a game-changer for hand-drawn animation. In fact, it&#8217;s a new holistic hybrid of 2D and 3D, thanks to an interface called Meander that they &#8216;hijacked&#8217; for the project from a young Disney programmer named Brian Whited, which was then refined by animator Eric Daniels and others. It&#8217;s a vector-based tool that empowers the animator with digital in-betweening and puts the drawings back on the screen.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Also check out the series of YouTube teasers from the director: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Mdhv0A07YA">the idea</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhGzKHXhbKs">the look</a>. And <a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/">the first still shots from the film</a>.</p>
<p>This kind of has <a href="../2008/04/ollie_johnston.html">why am I still programming</a> written all over it for me.</p>

			<p>Podcasts are more popular than ever. We&#8217;re lucky right now to have a bunch of podcast networks and great iOS clients, including the newly-released <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029?mt=8">official Podcasts app from Apple</a>. My favorite remains <a href="http://vemedio.com/instacast">Instacast on iPhone</a>, but there are other good choices like <a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/">Downcast</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never easy for developers when Apple arrives into your market with free competition, especially if it might one day be bundled on the OS alongside the Music and Videos apps. I wish the third-party guys the best of luck.</p>
<p>But for podcast creators, the extra exposure can only be a good thing. I hope we can welcome even more listeners to our Core Intuition podcast. We just opened a new way to send in feedback and questions, too: <a href="http://glassboard.com/">Glassboard</a>. Use invite code COREINT on the web or iPhone app to join the board and get a little behind-the-scenes look into the podcast.</p>
