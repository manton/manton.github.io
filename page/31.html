			<p>Now that I&#8217;m done &#8220;giving away a free iPhone&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/status/3370506213, I can move on to the next phase of my marketing plan: release new and better software! Crazy, huh? Clipstart 1.2 is nearly ready and I&#8217;m very proud of this release. There&#8217;s so much new stuff I could have called it 2.0.</p>
<p><em>Batch export.</em> Select multiple videos and convert them to H.264, or optimized for iPod, iPhone, and Apple TV, and optionally run a script on the results. It can even create an HTML 5 web site and export in Ogg Theora format for Firefox and Opera users.</p>
<p><em>Twitter upload.</em> Works with Yfrog to upload a video and post to Twitter. To include a custom tweet, use the &#8220;Upload with Options&#8221; command, just as you would add a description to a Flickr, Vimeo, or YouTube upload.</p>
<p><em>New tagging interface.</em> Easy way to tag multiple videos from the keyboard. You can also now drag videos to an existing tag to apply that tag to the selection.</p>
<p><em>iSight capture.</em> I wasn&#8217;t planning on adding this until later, but I think it complements the Twitter support well. Capture from the iSight and it records as H.264 and adds the video to your Clipstart library.</p>
<p><em>New toolbar and button style.</em> I shouldn&#8217;t have used the round rectangle scope button style in Clipstart 1.0, so I decided to roll my own that fit well with the toolbar. It&#8217;s still not a standard toolbar but I hope to transition to one in a future version of Clipstart.</p>
<p><em>Change date for multiple videos.</em> You can update the date for multiple videos at once, with the flexibility of changing specific portions of the date, such as just the year or month. Great for correcting dates from cameras.</p>
<p><em>AppleScript support.</em> Just the basics for now, but you can get a list of videos, with tags and other metadata for each.</p>
<p>Plus some other fixes and Snow Leopard compatibility. I plan to release it in the next couple days, just in case Snow Leopard is released on the 28th as rumored. If you are interested in trying a beta and submitting some last-minute feedback, drop me an email at &#8220;support@riverfold.com&#8221;:support@riverfold.com.</p>

			<p>Yesterday I sent out a newsletter to all my &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ customers. You can see the &#8220;text of the newsletter here&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/newsletter/2009/07.html. I wasn&#8217;t sure how effective this would be, but I immediately got a bunch of responses to the survey, and hopefully more interest in Clipstart too.</p>
<p>I decided against doing any specific tracking for number of views and links clicked, but there was an obvious spike in traffic for a couple hours as people clicked on the links in the email.</p>
<p>The survey results are about what I expected. Most people are buying Wii Transfer to watch movies and listen to music on their TV. I&#8217;ll use this feedback to simplify the user interface around these features, and prune back a feature set that had grown a little too fast for its own good.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a chart of the results so far:</p>
<p><img src="../images/2009/wt3survey.png" alt="Survey chart" border="0" width="524" height="270" /></p>
<p>I used &#8220;Campaign Monitor&#8221;:http://www.campaignmonitor.com/ for sending the newsletter, and as usual I&#8217;m very pleased with how simple they make this. I did a full customer export from my registration database and Campaign Monitor merged it with the existing list from my newsletter last year, weeding out duplicates and removing anyone who had already unsubscribed.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I get a lot of funny looks when I tell people I host everything on Dreamhost. It&#8217;s not a great fit for everything &mdash; I have some ideas for projects that would be better suited to Amazon EC2, and who knows, maybe I&#8217;ve just been on a lucky server &mdash; but it has generally been more reliable than any previous hosting company I&#8217;ve used, including when I used to run my own server.</p>
<p>Dreamhost succeeds because of scale. They have so many servers, and such low prices, that they are forced to automate everything. This means they can more quickly deploy new software, rebuild servers, or restore a broken installation, and that their panel interface has to provide access to every feature a customer might want.</p>
<p>&#8220;This post from their status blog&#8221;:http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/2009/07/18/network-problems-due-to-distribution-switch/ is revealing. There are over 600 machines on that list, but it must be only some fraction of their customer base, because my server name isn&#8217;t on there. &#8220;According to WebHosting.Info&#8221;:http://www.webhosting.info/webhosts/reports/total_domains/DREAMHOST.COM, Dreamhost hosts about 875,000 domains.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that &#8220;being small is a competitive advantage&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/customer.html, but anyone who&#8217;s played the role of sys admin knows that automation means everything, and that&#8217;s what Dreamhost seems to get right.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Sometimes it seems like every app is trying to be &#8220;the iTunes for &lt;insert subject here&gt;&#8221;. I&#8217;ve worked on &#8220;an app that fits into this category&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/software/bookshelf/, and there are countless more. iTunes 1.0 represents one of the biggest shifts in Mac user interface design we&#8217;ve seen &mdash; single window, source list, and smart groups.</p>
<p>While the iTunes UI is great for music, I&#8217;m not convinced it&#8217;s automatically great for all workflows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ goes out of its way to do something different, by twisting the traditional source list a little to promote tags as the most important part of the UI. At first I feared that some customers would find it worse, that the UI would fail and I would be forced to become more iTunes-ish for the next version. But I think only by trying something different can you hope to be better. I&#8217;ve been using Clipstart to manage my movies all year and the tag-focused UI really works, especially when you start building up your library and can search and find related tags across all your videos.</p>
<p>I released Clipstart 1.1.1 a few days ago with a bunch of bug fixes, and an &#8220;iPhone 3GS giveaway&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/press/3gs.html too.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>This month I&#8217;ve been lucky to have &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ featured in both the US and UK print editions of Macworld. It&#8217;s great to see the product in print.</p>
<p>Around 1996 to 1998 I worked for a small Mac software company called Purity Software. When &#8220;Ned Holbrook tweeted&#8221;:http://twitter.com/nedley/status/2639266306 that he had a collection of old Macworld print magazines, combined with having Clipstart&#8217;s review fresh in my mind, it jogged a memory that one of my products from Purity was reviewed in Macworld and I had always wished I had kept a copy. WebSentinel was a C++ PowerPlant app with a great UI for server products of that era (&#8220;screenshots here&#8221;:http://www.purity.com/websentinel.ws?page=exp &mdash; warning, Mac OS 8), though in hindsight it suffered from some annoying bugs and had trouble scaling. It turns out that 10 years later the review is nearly impossible to find online, but by following a series of broken links I eventually got a copy from the Internet Archive&#8217;s Wayback Machine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m archiving it below. It ran in the December 1998 issue.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><em>WebSentinel 2.0</em></p>
<p><em>Master of the Realms</em></p>
<p><em>By Jeff Davis</em></p>
<p>For Macintosh Webmasters who find their server&#8217;s built-in security limited and tedious, Purity Software&#8217;s WebSentinel 2.0 promises relief. This WebStar API (W*API) plug-in provides support for multiple database mechanisms and an attractive interface for an array of security services, including new features such as support for workstation restrictions, HTML log-in forms, and account expiration.</p>
<p>WebSentinel 2.0 extends the realms model of Web security common on Macintosh Web servers. Rather than applying permissions to a folder (such as the Logs folder), you set permissions for a group of URLs (the realm) that share some specific text (any URL that contains .log, for example). This method can be very powerful, allowing administrators to secure like files regardless of their location on the server.</p>
<p>In addition to standard HTTP authentication for realms, WebSentinel 2.0 supports HTML-forms-based authentication, allowing you to present personalized log-in screens. Webmasters can designate customized forms and no-access files for each realm. WebSentinel 2.0 even offers Redirection realms, so requests for certain URLs can be automatically sent to another page.</p>
<p>Once realms are defined, you grant access to users, groups, and workstations. In addition to simple user names and passwords, administrators can define expiration criteria for each user, consisting of a date, a number of days, or even a number of accesses.</p>
<p>WebSentinel 2.0 supports multiple &#8220;data targets&#8221; (back-end databases); you can save your information to more than one type of outside database, including those in Purity&#8217;s own Verona format and those in FileMaker Pro.</p>
<p>It took me about 60 seconds to install WebSentinel 2.0 on a Mac server running StarNine&#8217;s WebStar 3.01. After another five minutes, I had my users, groups, and realms up and running. Both the administrative application and Web-browser interface are attractive and usable, but a few very minor interface glitches exist. Although assigning access to users and groups is quite simple, WebSentinel 2.0 needs to offer an easier way to display all users and groups assigned to a given realm within a single window.</p>
<p>The security options all worked nicely, and there was no noticeable performance hit with ten users and realms. I did encounter problems when trying to use the plug-in with WebTen, due to an inconsistency with Tenon&#8217;s W*API implementation. Tenon has a patch that addresses these problems.</p>
<p><em>Macworld&#8217;s Buying Advice</em></p>
<p>Macintosh Webmasters will definitely find that WebSentinel 2.0 offers an elegant extension of WebStar&#8217;s realms-based security. But those dissatisfied with the whole realms concept should look to other options, such as Tenon&#8217;s WebTen, which offers built-in file and folder security.</p>
<p><em>RATING</em>: 3 1/2 mice <em>PROS</em>: Elegant interface; authentication forms; multiple data targets. <em>CONS</em>: Lack of file and folder security; no easy way to view access by realm. <em>COMPANY</em>: Purity Software (512/328-2288, www.purity.com). $199 (upgrade from 1.0, $79).</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;Huge post from Craig Hockenberry&#8221;:http://furbo.org/2009/07/10/year-two/ on the App Store. Lots of good points. I especially like the insight comparing it to the music store, the need for upgrade revenue, and ideas for improving discoverability.</p>
<p>Where I have a problem is at the $999.</p>
<p>Not for support or early access to new versions of the iPhone OS, that&#8217;s fine. ADC Select and Premier members are used to paying for non-essential bonuses. The issue is whether we should pay extra to work around a problem that Apple has created for themselves and developers.</p>
<p>And I totally respect that Craig is just throwing out a bunch of possible solutions, hoping that something will stick, that Apple will start to pay attention and draw inspiration from the community. &#8220;As he said on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/chockenberry/status/2577781479: &#8220;I just want to put money where my mouth is.&#8221; I think the $999 figure speaks to just how painful this process has become. Luckily developers are also natural problem-solvers, forever hopeful even when desperate.</p>
<p>But just as the $99 fee to become an iPhone developer didn&#8217;t filter out the junk apps and unserious developers new to the platform, neither will throwing more money at the problem make it go away. The gold rush is still on, and we should expect app submissions to only accelerate.</p>
<p>Most importantly, let&#8217;s take a step back and remember: <em>it was Apple&#8217;s choice to build a closed system, one in which they alone could approve and deny apps</em>. The idea that we should pay extra because they underestimated how much work it would be to approve thousands of apps really bothers me. It would be punishing developers for Apple&#8217;s own failure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Colin Barrett pointed out&#8221;:http://twitter.com/cbarrett/status/2576856894 that Apple loses money on free apps, when you consider server overhead and review staff. I find it difficult to believe that Apple is doing anything except raking in the cash from the App Store. After all, they are used to giving away bandwidth for a number of products: Safari and QuickTime downloads, iLife and iWork software updates, not to mention updates to Mac OS X itself.</p>
<p>From an article back in May, &#8220;Techcrunch also assumes&#8221;:http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/14/about-those-iphone-app-store-numbers/ that Apple is doing quite well off the App Store:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;$1 million a day means that Apple would be making $300,000 a day (its 30% cut). Extrapolated out over 10 months (the approximate age of the App Store), that would be about $90 million.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to believe that there is a solution to this. A quick reading of &#8220;AppShopper.com&#8221;:http://www.appshopper.com/ shows that on some days up to 100-200 apps go live on the store. That&#8217;s a lot of apps. But Apple is a large company, and they&#8217;ve surely dealt with more difficult staffing problems than <em>hiring some people who know how to use an iPhone</em>.</p>
<p>Other than a handful of exceptions in the jailbreak community, iPhone developers are playing by the rules Apple created. The burden is on Apple to deliver fast reviews, and it&#8217;s something that all developers deserve, not just a select few with extra cash to burn.</p>

			<p>Every product needs a believer. Not on the product team, but outside. A champion beta tester. Someone who sees the potential and will offer such constructive criticism and feedback early on that if you don&#8217;t make the app perfect you will be personally letting them down.</p>
<p>This is so critical, that many products succeed or fail to reach 1.0 on this point alone. Without inspiration from your peers, it becomes difficult to push through &#8220;the dip&#8221;:http://sethgodin.typepad.com/the_dip/, the rough times in development when everything goes wrong and you can&#8217;t imagine how your app will ever see the light of day. Seek out that one person &mdash; friend, spouse, blogger, anyone &mdash; who will light a fire under you to ship a quality product.</p>
<p>Yes, I want to hear how much you like my app, but I also want to hear where it fails and frustrates you.</p>
<p>The feedback I&#8217;ve received for &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ is astonishingly well thought out and helpful. I like to think the app is attracting the best kind of customers: articulate and experienced enough to know what they want. If I could only implement half the suggestions to improve the app it will evolve into something great.</p>
<p>Of course, great beta testers only go so far. We still have to work really hard. &#8220;Merlin Mann said it best&#8221;:http://www.43folders.com/2009/03/11/kutiman: &#8220;The only person who can sit on your ass is you.&#8221;</p>

			<p>&#8220;Clipstart 1.1&#8243;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ is out, with support for the iPhone 3GS, YouTube, and more. I&#8217;m really happy with the response I&#8217;ve received so far. The 3GS is such a convenient device for video that even people who weren&#8217;t taking lots of clips before now find themselves with a bunch of videos. That deserves a dedicated management app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ryan Irelan&#8221;:http://ryanirelan.com/ asked me the other day if Clipstart would support a simple email option, for quickly sharing a video with family without uploading to a web site. This is a pretty good candidate for using Clipstart&#8217;s file actions, which allow you to process the selected video files with a script.</p>
<p>I liked how &#8220;Acorn handled this kind of thing&#8221;:http://flyingmeat.com/wikka/AcornExtraScripts, so I essentially lifted its file actions feature directly and put it into Clipstart, even down to the ACShortcutKey shortcut comments. Even though Acorn is for still images and Clipstart for videos, it seemed similar enough that you could conceivably take lightly-modified scripts from one app and use it the other, if they did not deal with the file&#8217;s contents.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the email script that will be included in Clipstart 1.1.1:</p>
<p><tt><font color="gray">#!/usr/bin/osascript</font></p>
<p>on run <font color="green">argv</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; set <font color="green">filepath</font> to item 1 of <font color="green">argv</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; set <font color="green">old_delims</font> to AppleScript's text item delimiters</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; set AppleScript's text item delimiters to {"/"}</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; set <font color="green">path_items</font> to text items of (<font color="green">filepath</font> as text)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; set AppleScript's text item delimiters to <font color="green">old_delims</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; set <font color="green">filename</font> to last item of <font color="green">path_items</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; tell application "Mail"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; set <font color="green">new_msg</font> to make new outgoing message with properties {subject:<font color="green">filename</font>, content:"" &amp; return &amp; return}</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; tell <font color="green">new_msg</font></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; set visible to true</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; tell content</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; make new attachment with properties {file name:<font color="green">filepath</font>} at after the last paragraph</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; end tell</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; end tell</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp; activate</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; end tell</p>
<p>end</tt></p>
<p>Running scripts has been in Clipstart since 1.0. The implementation is pretty simple. I parse the available file action files to extract the executable path and any shortcut keys and modifiers, then dynamically create the menu items. When it&#8217;s time to run an action I use NSTask and friends to execute the program and pass the script file and selected movie path to it.</p>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<p><tt>/path/to/myscript.sh /path/to/movie.avi</tt></p>
<p>Clipstart does it like one of these:</p>
<p><tt>/usr/bin/bash /path/to/myscript.sh /path/to/movie.avi</tt></p>
<p><tt>/usr/bin/osascript /path/to/myscript.sh /path/to/movie.avi</tt></p>
<p>I did this to not require setting +x on the file, but it also seems to be a more convenient way of processing command line arguments when run from osascript.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>You know it has been a good conference when you come back inspired, with ideas and tools to build new things. No surprise that WWDC was like that for me, as it is pretty much every year.</p>
<p>Even before the keynote was over I was getting questions &mdash; which continued all week &mdash; about whether I had iPhone plans. At the very least, Clipstart 1.1 needs to be able to import videos off of the 3GS. &#8220;That&#8217;s in beta now&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/forums/topic.php?id=26. But what about a native phone app?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve convinced myself over the last couple weeks, after listening to what people are doing with their phones and evaluating the existing applications in the App Store, that Clipstart for iPhone would be a very useful app. Video on the 3GS is a big deal. Eventually I can see a new top-level Video category in the App Store, and whoever is in that list is going to do very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neven Mrgan&#8221;:http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/124025728/wwdc-2009 sums up the urgency:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure Phil Schiller&#8217;s prediction of iPhone 3GS quickly becoming the most popular video-capable phone &mdash; if not the most popular consumer video device period &mdash; is right on the money. A message for those working on apps that help us shoot, edit, organize, and share quick, casual video clips: get ready to get busy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit that after WWDC I panicked, thinking for a moment that I had to deliver Clipstart for iPhone immediately, and drop everything I&#8217;m doing to make that happen. I no longer believe that. The Mac version of Clipstart has a lot of potential and I can&#8217;t get too distracted from following up on that. But at the same time I will be expanding what I do on the phone, so we&#8217;ll see where that goes.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>What I like most about the &#8220;FastScripts 2.4 release&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/823/fastscripts-2-4 is that Daniel was willing to completely change the product evaluation terms to give new life to the product and get it out to more users.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have been thinking for some time of eliminating FastScripts Lite. Customers found it confusing to differentiate between the versions, and I found it tedious to artificially maintain two versions. With the new, liberal evaluation terms in FastScripts 2.4, all of the old Lite functionality and much more is now included for free in the full version.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s always a risk to make a pricing or demo limit change. Whether accurate or not, I imagine the financial side of product development as a delicate tower of blocks, where the slightest change could cause your whole sales structure to come crashing down. For that reason I tend to not touch anything if it is working, but I recognize that I am probably holding my business back at the same time by not being more flexible.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Paul Kafasis of Rogue Amoeba&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2009/06/04/the-future-of-macworld/ on exhibiting at Macworld 2010:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to be able to plant a flag and say that in 2010, Rogue Amoeba will again be exhibiting at Macworld. We still believe in Macworld and all that it provides. We believe it&#8217;s relevant, useful, and worth having. We believe that meeting new customers, talking to existing ones, and sharing a great time with all manner of Mac friends, is still worth doing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I like companies that make decisions based not just on spreadsheet numbers, but on belief and instinct too. It&#8217;s a shame Apple didn&#8217;t show more of that when weighing whether to continue exhibiting at Macworld. Because Rogue Amoeba doesn&#8217;t sell on the show floor, the conference has to be less about directly recouping costs and more about connecting with customers and building goodwill and name recognition. See also &#8220;Should I Exhibit At Macworld&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2007/01/16/should-i-exhibit-at-macworld-part-1-costs/, from Paul Kafasis in 2007.</p>

			<p>Last week I looked at the SVN log for my application in development and realized that I had started it exactly 1 year ago. While I wasn&#8217;t actively working on it every day or week during that time, that&#8217;s still a very long time for me to work on an application before shipping it. I knew I had to call the 1.0 done and push it out.</p>
<p>I was falling into that infinite 1.0 cycle where I could continue to improve the application forever without releasing it. The sooner I noticed that trap, the sooner I was able to correct course and get the app into the hands of real users.</p>
<p>The app is called &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/. It&#8217;s for importing, tagging, and uploading home movies. I have high hopes for the app and a lot of fun stuff planned for the future.</p>
<p>As usual, a lot of people talked about the product even before I did. My thanks to Dan Moren of Macworld for &#8220;covering the launch&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/140376/2009/05/clipstart.html before I even had a chance to spam him with a press release; to John Gruber for &#8220;posting about how he uses it&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/05/04/clipstart; and to &#8220;Duncan Davidson&#8221;:http://journal.duncandavidson.com/post/102477678/clipstart and &#8220;Mike Zornek&#8221;:http://blog.clickablebliss.com/2009/05/04/clipstart-10/ for their write-ups. I also very much appreciate &#8220;all the retweets&#8221;:http://search.twitter.com/search?q=clipstart and goodwill from my friends on Twitter. Those meant a lot.</p>

			<p>There&#8217;s always the risk when developing for Mac OS X that Apple will compete directly with your product. iTunes, Mail, and Safari are high-profile examples, as well as the &#8220;lightning strikes twice&#8221; hit of Watson/Sherlock and Sandvox/iWeb. That history is &#8220;well documented&#8221;:http://www.karelia.com/news/small_and_nimble_the_long_s.html so I won&#8217;t repeat it here.</p>
<p>But when listening to the &#8220;Macworld podcast&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/mwpodcast.html a week ago (the episode with Dan Moren and Jason Snell back from the iPhone 3.0 announcement) it struck me that iPhone software is a little unique. They made the point, which I think is true for most software, that Apple&#8217;s offering is usually simple, full of holes that could be filled with new features from third-party developers. There is usually room for a developer with a unique twist on an idea to market and sell his solution to like-minded users, even if Apple ships a default good-enough app for most people.</p>
<p>Except there&#8217;s one pretty significant problem, especially on the iPhone. Apple cheats.</p>
<p>Third-party apps cannot run in the background. So it doesn&#8217;t matter how many features a recording app has that Apple won&#8217;t bother to implement, background recording is the killer feature that will always remain out of reach for developers.</p>
<p>Put another way, if the Apple app didn&#8217;t record in the background and a third-party app could, that third-party app would likely be worth $5-10 to many people for that one feature alone. But give Apple background recording and it doesn&#8217;t matter how many features another app adds &mdash; syncing music, FTPing to a server, multiple tracks, sound effects, more file formats &mdash; it&#8217;s going to be a challenge to convince users they need two recording apps. I expect some audio developers to overcompensate by adding every feature listed above and more to make up for the one feature they can&#8217;t have.</p>

			<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to write about MacHeist this year, but after a hail storm damaged nearly every roof in our neighborhood, I noticed something kind of obvious: there are a lot of business that <em>make it up on volume</em>.</p>
<p>This is the new MacHeist promise, right? Not just exposure, although that&#8217;s part of it, but selling so many tens of thousands of copies that the developers do very well regardless of their tiny underpriced cut of the profits per sale.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t get hail in Austin very often. I took the Flip out and &#8220;filmed a little bit of it&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/3443213704, as golf-ball sized balls of ice blanketed the yard. Afterwards every roofing company in Texas descended on Austin offering steep discounts, in some cases even covering an insurance deductable of $2000 or more. Depending on who you ask, such practices may or may not be considered insurance fraud, but like MacHeist it does come with ethical considerations. The roofing companies knew that they could do so much business in the next 2 weeks that they will easily make up for reduced profits by the sheer volume of work.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another kind of discount shared between roofing companies and MacHeist. Users promote the package they just purchased in exchange for further discounts. For MacHeist it&#8217;s spamming your Twitter followers (I get a free Delicious Library!). For roofers it&#8217;s spamming your neighbors with a yard sign (I get $250 off!).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned a few things from all of this that I think will help me make &#8220;my own indie business&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ stronger, or at least more consistent. I gladly give free licenses to reviewers, bloggers, and small Mac user groups. I also routinely do 10-20% off discounts that anyone who knows how to search Twitter or &#8220;RetailMeNot.com&#8221;:http://www.retailmenot.com/ can use.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m just going to have a default &#8220;no thanks&#8221; answer for big promotions and mass giveaways. It&#8217;s consistent with what I believe about keeping prices fair to sustain a Mac business, and it takes the guess work out of which promotions harm the Mac ecosystem and which are a great deal for everyone.</p>

			<p>Last week my &#8220;@wii&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii account on Twitter passed 3000 followers and seems to finally be growing strong after a year of neglect. I now try to post once every couple days with Nintendo news, and I&#8217;ll eventually throw in a tweet on new Wii Transfer updates. That was my evil plan from the beginning: have some fun with the account but also use it to build an audience and promote my own projects.</p>
<p>I view @wii as a gift. I don&#8217;t know how long it will be under my control. As Twitter continues to go mainstream, eventually I expect Nintendo will want my little 3-character Twitter name for themselves, and I might just be glad to hand it off. Twitter works best with a personal voice, and I&#8217;ve already all but closed some of my secondary accounts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m more conflicted about what to do with the &#8220;Wii Friend Codes site&#8221;:http://wiitransfer.com/codes/. At one time I imagined it as a full Riverfold product, with integrated Mac and iPhone apps, but now I find that I lack the passion to really take it to new places. And to be honest, it works as is.</p>

			<p>On a previous episode of &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/, number 14, Daniel and I talked about open source. One LGPL tool I use in Wii Transfer is called FFmpeg, a very popular video conversion project that forms the base of many video web sites, as well as the Mac QuickTime component, Perian.</p>
<p>In the latest Wii Transfer I updated to a new version of FFmpeg, which it turns out had a major bug: &#8220;broken audio for 8-bit input sources&#8221;:https://roundup.mplayerhq.hu/roundup/ffmpeg/issue582. Of course I am including the fix in a bug fix update to Wii Transfer (still &#8220;beta in the forums&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/forums/), but not before many customers were hit by the problem.</p>
<p>Not to look a gift horse in the mouth, but it reminds me of one annoyance with FFmpeg: no releases. You basically just follow trunk, and if there&#8217;s a bug, sorry. This is understandable. It&#8217;s open source, after all, and the developers don&#8217;t owe you anything. But at the same time, it&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;ve moved to Perian-only in my new app, and left the FFmpeg trunk and other similar open source command line tool projects behind. With Perian I can track specific major releases and know that someone has tested them. QTKit is good enough now on Leopard that I feel comfortable basing on app on it.</p>
<p>Daniel also mentioned in passing that violators of open source licenses are likely to get away with it. I think that&#8217;s largely true, but I found that the FFmpeg developer base has a pretty keen eye to this issue. If they notice that commercial software is using FFmpeg or MEncoder or other portions inappropriately, they will list the software in their &#8220;hall of shame&#8221;:http://www.ffmpeg.org/shame.html.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s often true that the further away you get from an event, like the release day for the Safari 4 beta, the closer you get to a fair analysis. Initial Twitter reaction was gut level and some not even based on anything but screen shots. &#8220;My own post&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/02/defending.html was admittedly slightly half baked, but I think it stands up fine.</p>
<p>Now we are seeing some more thoughtful analysis, including from &#8220;Dan Frakes of Macworld&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/139026/2009/02/safari4tabs.html, and &#8220;Lukas Mathis&#8221;:http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2009/02/26/on-tabs-and-docking-and-title-bars/, and of course the thorough &#8220;John Gruber of Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2009/03/safari_4_public_beta.</p>
<p>I wanted to revisit one thing with click-through. If you eliminate the mouse rollovers and click-through for inactive tabs, you end up with surprisingly few places to accidentally click. Here are two screenshots illustrating the difference between Safari 4 and BBEdit.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="../images/2009/title_bars.png"><img src="../images/2009/title_bars_small.png" alt="Safari 4 tab example" border="0" width="550" height="65" /></a></div>
<p>It&#8217;s true that the file icon needs a hold-and-drag, so it&#8217;s harder to click, and the hide toolbar button is off to the side and less dangerous than closing a tab. Nevertheless, viewed by pixels alone there isn&#8217;t a significant difference between the safely clickable area of these two window title bars if Apple makes this small change.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: If I left too much to the imagination, here are examples of the real Safari 4 clickable areas, not the way I wish it would be above.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="../images/2009/title_bars2.png" alt="Safari 4 tab current "><img src="../images/2009/title_bars2_small.png" alt="title_bars2_small.png" border="0" width="550" height="24" /></a></div>
<p>And the extreme example with even more tabs:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><a href="../images/2009/title_bars3.png"><img src="../images/2009/title_bars3_small.png" alt="Safari 4 tab extreme" border="0" width="550" height="27" /></a></div>
<p>The important point is that if you disable click-through for inactive tabs, the safe area does not change even with dozens of tabs, and in my opinion it is only marginally worse than other standard Mac applications, as shown in the first two screenshots. The current Safari 4 behavior, on the other hand, continues to degrade until the window title bar is nearly useless.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Brent Simmons is still looking&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2009/03/07/still_looking_for_a_version_control_syst for the perfect version control system:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People talk about how wonderful are features like re-writing history &mdash; and I read that stuff and think, &#8216;Wow, Git&#8217;s really cool and powerful.&#8217; But then I know it could suck me in and take away time from _real_ work. It&#8217;s _already_ more work &mdash; _for me_ &mdash; than when using Subversion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used Git much since Daniel and I discussed it on an early &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ episode. Like Brent I just don&#8217;t see a big win for single-person projects, although it&#8217;s fascinating to watch how open source projects are using &#8220;Github&#8221;:http://github.com/.</p>
<p>I like what Brent did a few months ago with his blog redesign, how both inessential.com and ranchero.com complement each other. He also wrote &#8220;more about his publishing system&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head, including a bit in passing about the tool I used to start my blog, Radio Userland.</p>
<p>I mention it because this blog is 7 years old today. Happy birthday to manton.org.</p>

			<p>In my &#8220;last post about family pricing&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2008/10/family_packs.html, I mentioned that I modified my PayPal scripts for backend order processing to support family packs, but I left out that the whole system is a hack. A hack that processes a nice chunk of money, but a hack nonetheless. Hard-coded PayPal buttons and coupons, PHP that would make even newbie web developers cringe, too few lines of code to really be taken seriously.</p>
<p>I refactored it a few months ago, but kept some ugliness in there to remind myself that I should move to a &#8220;mature store solution&#8221;:http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore. Sometimes we build systems that are flawed from the start, and it&#8217;s wasted effort to invest time into something that will be replaced. Instead, let the thing stand out like a sore thumb.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a complement to doing things simply and taking shortcuts even when it&#8217;s tempting to overengineer and build the perfect system.</p>
<p>This ugliness trick works for other things too. For example, the Wii Transfer product page is /software/wiitransfer/ instead of just /wiitransfer. I gave this URL more thought and second-guessing than it deserved, and every time I type /software/ or see the link I cringe a little. But I did it for a purpose: one day I hope to sell or promote things other than software. For example, when I registered riverfold.com I was working on an independent animated film which I planned to sell on DVD direct to customers. (I&#8217;ve had that shelved for years now, though, as I&#8217;ve recently discovered there are only 24 hours in a day.)</p>
<p>Others will say that you shouldn&#8217;t mix such different projects under the same brand, and that makes a lot of sense. But I also know it to be true that if you want to build a strong blog following, you should stick to one subject and become a respected voice in that field, and I didn&#8217;t do that either. I made a conscious decision with my personal blog to keep it loose and cover several different things that I am passionate about, and because of that I&#8217;ll likely never have tens of thousands of readers as other popular Mac development blogs have.</p>
<p>So maybe one day Riverfold will sell something other than Mac software. When that time comes, it won&#8217;t matter what the URLs are, but until then, the /software/ URL won&#8217;t let me ever forget that I have other things in mind.</p>
