			<p>If you are wondering why I haven&#8217;t posted here in over a month, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been getting my writing fix &#8220;over on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton, in 140 characters or less a couple times a day. Still trying to figure out the best way to integrate that experience into this site. I also have the usual queue of blog post drafts that will roll out here when I have time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile&#8230;</p>
<p>A bunch of really interesting things hit today. Microsoft Surface (can&#8217;t wait for the multi-touch iPhone); iTunes Plus (already upgraded my songs); and YouTube on the Apple TV (welcome if unexpected).</p>
<p>I have actually been dreading the iTunes Plus announcement because I am behind in &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ development, and I had hoped to coincide version 2.3 with the DRM-free AAC files on iTunes. It should be ready for a private beta in a few days. (Want in on the beta? Just email <a href="mailto:support@riverfold.com">support@riverfold.com</a>.)</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the YouTube feature that is really fascinating to me. I&#8217;ve long thought that Apple has all but given up on web video, somehow content to let Flash dominate. The Apple movie trailers site as the last pocket of QuickTime content isn&#8217;t quite good enough. Apple could have created something on the scale of YouTube but hooked into the iApps, .Mac, and built on QuickTime. Maybe even as an extension of the iTunes Store around video podcasts.</p>
<p>(The great thing about podcasts is that they are decentralized, but it makes it a little more difficult when you are trying to build a community. The iTunes Store also does a great job for discovery but nothing to help content creators. There is no one-step upload.)</p>
<p>The Apple TV announcement is weird because while on the surface it looks like a confirmation that Flash video wins, it might just be the first sign of Apple fighting back. Every video on YouTube will get the H.264 treatment. The web video revolution (of sorts) has been great, but the pieces are coming together for truly useful broadband video. Perhaps YouTube sees that they could be a major player not just for silly webcam videos but as an infrastructure for high quality distribution, with content in some categories that will rival the networks.</p>
<p>That future is especially believable the first time you sync up near-HD video podcasts to the Apple TV. It&#8217;s a great experience and definitely exceeded my expectations.</p>

			<p>Paul Graham thinks &#8220;Microsoft and desktop apps are dead&#8221;:http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gmail also showed how much you could do with web-based software, if you took advantage of what later came to be called &#8216;Ajax.&#8217; And that was the second cause of Microsoft&#8217;s death: everyone can see the desktop is over. It now seems inevitable that applications will live on the web &#8212; not just email, but everything, right up to Photoshop. Even Microsoft sees that now.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s definitely off the mark with that statement. Luckily &#8220;Martin Pilkington has a counter-rant&#8221;:http://pilky.mcubedsw.com/index.php?/site/the_desktop_is_here_to_stay/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There seems to be a slightly delusional section of web developers who seem to believe that in a few years time all of our applications and data will be online, while our computers run little more than a browser. Of course this is complete bull.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As someone who builds both desktop software and web apps, I&#8217;m very much interested in what happens in the middle. Next generation Mac software in particular can mix local HTML interfaces, web services, and syncing with a traditional rich UI to build something that is the best of both offline and online worlds.</p>
<p>I had an interesting conversation with &#8220;Willie Abrams&#8221;:http://willie.tumblr.com/ the other day about why the Flickr UI is better than iPhoto, even if you take away all the social parts of Flickr. The reason is that Flickr introduces extra layouts specific to certain types of activities, such as the excellent calendar view for archives. Another example of a web app UI innovation is the Backpack reminder UI that &#8220;John Gruber recently wrote about&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2007/03/deal_with_it.</p>
<p>Web apps are usually able to iterate on features and interfaces much quicker than desktop software, but that doesn&#8217;t make web apps inherently better. Put another way, iCal sucks because it hasn&#8217;t been seriously updated in 5 years.</p>
<p>I have other thoughts on this topic, but already I&#8217;ve extended this blog post 3 paragraphs more than intended.</p>

			<p>After I &#8220;blogged last month&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/i_hate_domains.html about the very small number of domain names I own, I got some good feedback from people I respect. They basically said: &#8220;You&#8217;re an idiot. Domain names are cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the more I thought about it, the more they were right. So last week I made an offer to buy the wiitransfer.com domain from its current owner, and after just about 48 hours I had the domain and was updating Wii Transfer to use it. Now all registered users can use the simpler bookmark URL wiitransfer.com/username to point to their shared music.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also finally rolling out a bug fix update tonight (version 2.2.1, &#8220;available here&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/). The most important change is that some MP3s that would not play will now work. Some customers never saw this, but for some people a large percentage of their music library was unusable. It turned out to be that certain kinds of embedded cover album artwork in the MP3 would break the Flash player on the Wii. The work-around I used is to load the MP3 into memory and clear all its ID3 tags before sending it over the wire.</p>
<p>It feels good to be working on Wii Transfer again. The next version is already underway and should make a lot of people happy.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s been over a week since SXSW Interactive wrapped up, and I can&#8217;t bring myself to post anything interesting about it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I had a great time. But I missed more sessions than usual this year (I&#8217;m trying to ship software here!), skipped half the parties (Traci was sick all weekend), and I didn&#8217;t notice any big themes that unified the conference.</p>
<p>Except Twitter. Which just underscores that it is about the people, and what they are doing, and being inspired.</p>
<p>I had a great time meeting new folks and catching up with old acquaintances: talking independent Mac development with Buzz Andersen and Justin Miller; software pricing with John Gruber; Rails and cities with Jamie Stephens and Sergio Rabiela; bumping into old school Mac web guys Carl de Cordova, Raines Cohen, Bill Christensen, and Wes Felter; co-workers and former co-workers Damon Clinkscales and Ryan Irelan respectively; lunch in a pub as a storm came down with Austinites Ben and Sara Brumfield; seeing my old friend John Brauer from high school who needs to email me (hint!); and finally meeting Shaun Inman and a bunch of other people whose names I can&#8217;t recall at the moment and whose business cards are buried somewhere, but no one is quite sure where.</p>
<p>My only regret is that there were a few people I wanted to say hi to that I literally saw from a distance on the first day of the conference and then <em>never saw again</em>. Maybe they took the wrong escalator and are still trapped in the void of that 3rd floor.</p>
<p>Of all the kajillion SXSW posts that have come through my fresh not-even-a-beta copy of NetNewsWire, I liked &#8220;Peter Merholtz&#8217;s write-up&#8221;:http://www.peterme.com/?p=533 the best:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What I realized, and what I need to do if I return to SXSW, is that in order to enjoy what SXSW Interactive has become (and boy, has it changed since 1999) I have to take a more Zen-like approach, ignoring all the Things I Could Be Doing, and focus on simply getting the most out of whatever I Am Doing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Seeya next year.</p>

			<p>Ten minutes until midnight as I type this. I started this blog 5 years ago. There have been just 329 posts in those 5 years, but there are some good ones in there. One thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that over the years I&#8217;ve switched from collecting links and providing short commentary, to more thoughtful longer posts. I&#8217;m hoping in this next year to go back to more of the earlier style.</p>
<p>My weblog anniversary also means that &#8220;SXSW&#8221;:http://www.sxsw.com/ is starting. I don&#8217;t plan to blog this weekend, but will instead be updating through &#8220;my Twitter account&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton. To be honest I&#8217;m not sure what to expect from this year&#8217;s conference. I&#8217;m looking forward to a few sessions, but with RailsConf and WWDC and another work trip all lined up for the coming few months, I&#8217;m feeling a little conferenced-out before I&#8217;ve even begun.</p>
<p>Here are the previous anniversary posts: &#8220;2006&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2006/03/mediocrity_is_the.html, &#8220;2005&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2005/03/year_three.html, &#8220;2004&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2004/03/two_years.html, &#8220;2003&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2003/03/at_sxsw.html, and &#8220;2002&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2002/03/sxsw.html.</p>
<p>Also checked out the new Apple Store at The Domain today, which is a couple miles from my house. Was 250th in line without really trying, and the weather was nice enough to work under the oak trees outside Starbucks. Took pictures with my camera phone which I don&#8217;t have the energy to post right now. Tonight I headed back downtown for the opening of &#8220;Jason Chalker&#8217;s&#8221;:http://manlyart.blogspot.com/ art show.</p>

			<p>&#8220;STAPLE! The Independent Media Expo&#8221;:http://www.staple-austin.org/ was last Saturday and it turned out great. The &#8220;animation panel I wrote about last week&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/animation_panel.html was a lot of fun and didn&#8217;t seem to suffer too much from my amateur moderating abilities. The projector worked, the films were great, and we filled an hour and a half with questions from the audience. Special thanks to &#8220;Damon&#8221;:http://www.damonclinkscales.com/ for working the lights and providing feedback afterwards.</p>
<p>My only regret is that I didn&#8217;t take a few minutes to snap photos or set up a video camera in the back to capture it. I left my camera in the car the whole day. Luckily other attendees took pictures of the rest of the show. Here are Flickr sets from &#8220;Freddie Avalos&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/freddieavalos/sets/72157594570835464/, &#8220;Toby Craig&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/ithinkican/sets/72157594574373510/, and &#8220;Marianne Ways&#8221;:http://flickr.com/photos/mways/sets/72157594569262131/. <b>Update</b>: Damon &#8220;snapped a picture&#8221;:http://flickr.com/photos/digitalnomad/413875252/in/photostream/ after all!</p>
<p>Sunday night was the &#8220;Animation Show&#8221;:http://www.animationshow.com/ at the Paramount and Don Hertzfeldt answered questions afterwards. His latest film may be my favorite of his yet. I worked with Robert at the Animation Show on cross-promotion between their show and STAPLE!, and they were so great to work with I hope we can join forces again next time.</p>
<p>I came away from the whole weekend inspired. Monday a new idea for an animated short film hit me. I think it&#8217;s time to dust off the animation table again.</p>

			<p>In the tradition of other independent Mac developers such as &#8220;Mike Zornek&#8221;:http://clickablebliss.com/blog/2007/01/08/billable_the_first_100_days/, &#8220;Daniel Jalkut&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/191/lawful-prey, and &#8220;Gus Mueller&#8221;:http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/25.html, I&#8217;m going to share some sales information from the first 75 days of Wii Transfer.</p>
<p>The following chart shows daily sales (in units sold) for each day. I&#8217;ve also highlighted important milestones so you can see what affect they had on sales, such as shipping 2.0 (which brought many links) and increasing the price (from $9 to $14, which brought my first 2.0 day of no sales at all). Finally, there are a few spots where I show the average number of visitors.</p>
<p><img src="../images/2007/sales_75_days.png" width="600" height="220" alt="Sales chart" /></p>
<p>(As an aside, I created this chart in Keynote. I love software that is simple and flexible enough to be used for purposes outside its original developer&#8217;s intentions. I wrote &#8220;more on this subject back in early 2006&#8243;:http://www.manton.org/2006/01/limitations_in_toys.html.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to tell, but the numbers on the right side are on average a little bit higher than the left. Not by much though. Sales just trickle in again right now (a few a day).</p>
<p>So what does it all mean? Here is the basic take-away: Sales are much better than I thought they would be, but not nearly enough to live off of. That&#8217;s okay, because I happen to love &#8220;my day job&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ (also writing Mac software). However, I can definitely see how it would be possible to do this full time, with some real marketing and a collection of several additional applications. I have done zero marketing for Wii Transfer except listing it on MacUpdate, VersionTracker, and Apple&#8217;s download site (where it was featured in the video section).</p>
<p>As you can see, there was a big spike in sales when 2.0 was released. This is a direct result of links from Mac sites like The Unofficial Apple Weblog and Daring Fireball, and gaming sites like Jostiq and others. When traffic goes up, sales go up. This opened my eyes because it really is all about getting your app in front of other users. &#8220;As I blogged about previously&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/wii_transfer_takes.html, I think I also missed some sales opportunities during this period because 2.0 was not very stable.</p>
<p>Other interesting stats: The conversion rate is between 2% and 5%. For every 100 downloads, a few people decide to purchase it. I think many active users probably end up paying for it. Instead of a trial demo period, some features are just crippled, and it isn&#8217;t very usable day-to-day without unlocking the full feature set (for example, with music sharing to the Wii, you can only play one song at a time &#8212; no iTunes playlists or shuffle).</p>
<p>There are at least a few pirates too. I&#8217;m not too worried about them because &#8220;you can&#8217;t stop pirating&#8221;:http://wilshipley.com/blog/2007/02/piracy-reduction-can-be-source-of.html, and most people are honest. One customer was even nice enough to tell me about a pirated serial number he found.</p>
<p>To everyone who purchased Wii Transfer, thanks! When I built 1.0, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I would work on it again. Now, several versions later at 2.2, I have a clear roadmap of features (and bugs!) to keep me busy.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Chris&#8221;:http://ycrtft.rethunkmedia.com/ and I headed over to Northcross Mall yesterday to take a final look at the conference center rooms before next week&#8217;s STAPLE! Expo. Although I&#8217;ve been on the planning committee since the very beginning of the conference over 3 years ago and actively involved for each of the previous 2 shows, this year is a little special because I&#8217;ve been organizing a panel on animation to complement the mostly comic book focused show. We have three great local animators this year: Aaron Romo, Evan Cagle, and Lance Myers. See the &#8220;STAPLE! guests page&#8221;:http://www.staple-austin.org/guests/ for more information on their work and our other featured speakers.</p>
<p>I also redesigned the web site last week, late Thursday night. In order to accommodate some CSS improvements and images from our new program, I had to abandon a few things from last year&#8217;s excellent design by &#8220;John Rubio&#8221;:http://www.johnrubio.com/ (who also did the logo). I hope to bring back elements of the old design for next year, though. There&#8217;s just not enough time in the day, and March is days away. I hate you February, for being so short.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>One of the most interesting (and difficult) parts of running an independent software business is responding to support email. It is very time-consuming and often more frustrating than writing code because the solutions can be illusive. You want to help the customer, but it&#8217;s not always obvious how.</p>
<p>Two blog posts in the last week take entirely different approaches to customer support. &#8220;The first is from Ryan Carson&#8221;:http://www.carsonified.com/web-apps/how-to-deal-with-abusive-customers, who is well known for DropSend and The Future of Web Apps conference. Here&#8217;s a snippet from his response to a customer:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am now marking your email address as spam and your communication will no longer get through. If you don&#8217;t want to use our service any more, please cancel your account.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I was relieved to read the comments, which are more sane. I think Ryan made a mistake in how he dealt with the customer, and wasted a bunch of time in the process. Adding a customer to your spam filter? Yikes. I would have refunded the customer their $5 immediately.</p>
<p>(I actually like a lot of what Ryan writes and the events he puts on, but lately I find myself noticing the differences. As another example, his post about &#8220;outsourcing programming work to Russia&#8221;:http://www.carsonified.com/misc/why-you-need-to-get-rid-of-your-freelance-developer-asap left me puzzled.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Joel Spolsky also wrote an essay&#8221;:http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html on support, and it&#8217;s just about perfect. I especially like his section on <em>memorizing awkward phrases</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s completely natural to have trouble saying &#8216;It&#8217;s my fault.&#8221; That&#8217;s human. But those three words are going to make your angry customers much happier. So you&#8217;re going to have to say them. And you&#8217;re going to have to sound like you mean it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For almost every support email I get, I start by responding like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hi Bob, Thanks for purchasing Wii Transfer. I&#8217;m sorry to hear it was not working correctly for you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This does three things right away that I think are important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greet the person by their name. Kind of like making eye contact. And it&#8217;s respectful without being overly formal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank them for using the product. If they haven&#8217;t bought it yet, replace &#8220;purchasing&#8221; with &#8220;trying.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apologize that the software gave them trouble. This is mostly equivalent to Joel&#8217;s &#8220;it&#8217;s my fault&#8221; phrase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I could probably respond faster by using some macro shortcuts that do this for me, I actually type this out every time, varying it slightly as is appropriate for the question. I then move on to the actual solution or follow-up question about their issue.</p>
<p>This is more than just trying to be nice to people. As someone in the comments to Ryan Carson&#8217;s post said: you need to show the customer that you are on their side. Going negative demonstrates that you care about receiving their money but not actually building something useful that makes their life easier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a portion of 37signals take on being on the customers side, from &#8220;Getting Real&#8221;:http://gettingreal.37signals.com/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At 37signals, all of our support emails are answered personally by the people who actually build the product. Why? First off, it provides better support for customers. They&#8217;re getting a response straight from the brain of someone who built the app. Also, it keeps us in touch with the people who use our products and the problems they&#8217;re encountering. When they&#8217;re frustrated, we&#8217;re frustrated. We can say, &#8216;I feel your pain&#8217; and actually mean it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Most people who buy Mac software from independent developers know that it&#8217;s only 1-5 people behind the company. We can&#8217;t compete with the Microsofts and Adobes of the world on application size, but we can compete on quality customer service. <em>Being small is a competitive advantage.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve exchanged at least a couple hundred emails in the last few months with customers or potential customers. (I don&#8217;t actually distinguish between users who have bought the product or who are just trying it out. They all get the same level of support.) Have I handled each one perfectly? Probably not. There are a few people who are still experiencing problems. But my hope is that just writing this blog post will serve as a guide and reminder of why taking support seriously is worth it.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Wii Transfer 2.2 is taking longer to get ready than I had planned, so I&#8217;ve decided to post a public beta while the last pieces are polished up. You can &#8220;grab it from the news section&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ of the Riverfold site (lower right). It is very close to being done, but giant chunks of code have been completely rewritten. I hope the extra testing will help make 2.2 an extremely solid release, and get some of the new features in the hands of users as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new in 2.2? iTunes playlists and several new preferences to control picture sharing top the list, but there are at least a dozen changes underneath the hood.</p>
<p>The web server built into Wii Transfer has seen some work in particular. Music browsing now uses the iTunes Music Library.xml file for everything rather than look at directory contents, and you can change the port number on the fly without restarting Wii Transfer if there is a conflict with any other applications.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also added reflections to the album cover art! You can see a &#8220;screenshot here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/wii_transfer_cover.jpg and another one of &#8220;the collage for playlists here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/wii_transfer_collage.jpg (these are from Safari, but it looks mostly the same on the Wii). This was really fun to do, but unfortunately it somehow introduced a subtle double-release bug that I spent hours fixing. It would only happen if the album art could not be found in iTunes and while multiple connections were hitting the server (i.e. it was ultimately a threading issue), and maybe only every dozen requests.</p>
<p>I tracked it down by using ab (Apache Bench), pointed at Wii Transfer. I had a shell script with a bunch of lines that looked like:</p>
<p><code>ab -n 200 -c 4 "http://localhost:9000/m/Beatles.cover</code></p>
<p>This URL asks Wii Transfer to grab any album art from iTunes for The Beatles, apply the reflection and return the JPEG data. It is flexible because you can send it any search strings. Other examples might be: <code>Evanescence%20Door.cover</code> or <code>Zoo%20Station.cover</code>. I was a little surprised that my little server was actually pumping out pages fairly quickly considering all the AppleScript and Quartz stuff going on. 10-20 requests per second isn&#8217;t much for a real web application, but for an app that is by definition single-user, it&#8217;s perfect.</p>
<p>The reflection code was made even easier by &#8220;BHReflectedImage&#8221;:http://bithaus.com/2006/11/05/nsimage-reflection/, which I modified to work with black backgrounds and then wrapped up in other helper methods to composite the cover and reflection together. When I first ran across this code I didn&#8217;t even notice it was written by Jeff Ganyard, who I&#8217;ve known for years and still run into at WWDC. Thanks Jeff! This goes in the about box credits with a bunch of other mentions. There is a really active Mac developer community that contributes source pretty freely, and I hope to add a few things to that collection one of these day as well.</p>

			<p>I have been &#8220;iTunes-free for four weeks now&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/goodbye_itms.html, and I hate it. It must be like quitting smoking, except without the fear of dying always at your back. I stopped by a Best Buy the other day and <em>couldn&#8217;t find any CDs to buy</em>. How do you shop for music without listening to it first? How do you find new artists without &#8220;customers also bought&#8230;&#8221; sidebars? Years ago I might listen to the radio to discover new music, but that was before the dial was permanently stuck on NPR.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve Jobs dropped the bomb&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/ while I was at lunch yesterday, and I furiously read and re-read it and watched the fallout. Blog entries in NetNewsWire lit up like clockwork. As &#8220;I posted to Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton, when the balance tips again to user control we&#8217;ll look back at this as a real shift in thinking. And the reason you know it&#8217;s true is because it sounds redundant to say the words.</p>
<p>But today&#8230; I browsed for music on iTunes and then ordered CDs from Amazon.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>There is a story behind the name &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/, but it&#8217;s probably not a very good one and I won&#8217;t go on a tangent by telling it here. What I will say is that I hate domain names.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I remember when domain names used to be free (I do), or maybe it&#8217;s because I get some thrill out of typing in IP addresses (I don&#8217;t), or maybe it&#8217;s because I think domains should last forever, like a printed book in wide circulation. But in any case I decided not to register WiiTransfer.com when I first named the product. Five days after announcing and shipping 1.0, someone else registered the domain, for their own presumably evil purposes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned just a handful of domains over the years. During the dot-com days I registered MyEdit.com and started building a web-based note filing system (sort of like &#8220;Stikkit&#8221;:http://stikkit.com/, but not as good). Then there were the family web site and related domains.</p>
<p>I let all of them expire, except manton.org. I kept riverfold.com for &#8220;everything else&#8221;, and I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with the simplicity of that decision right now. It was probably foolish to pass up the domain for my own product. But how many people type in photoshop.com to go anywhere? No one who matters.</p>
<p>There is a thread on the MacSB mailing list about the rise of product-oriented web sites (the &#8220;DiscoApp.com&#8221;:http://www.discoapp.com/&#8217;s of this new era of glitzy Mac shareware), and it really made me second-guess my decision to not <em>register everything</em>. But at the end of the day, it&#8217;s one less thing I have to worry about, and I can focus on stuff that is more interesting.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve blogged a lot about my side project &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ lately, but it&#8217;s time to show my &#8220;real&#8221; job some love as well. Internally at &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ last week we rolled over to beta status for the upcoming Bookshelf 4.5, and I&#8217;m really excited about what is coming. I&#8217;ve been working on the note sharing and syncing feature off and on for over a year now.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s it all mean? In a nutshell, create highlights and notes in your digital textbooks and have them flow to other users or to any of your computers. As Steve Jobs said with a totally straight face at the iPhone introduction: <em>It works like magic.</em></p>
<p>(That was one of my personal favorites from Macworld. Rewatch the keynote and see the expression on his face. This magic is serious stuff.)</p>
<p>At least, magic is the goal. If it was that easy we would have shipped by now. Behind the scenes it gets a little tricky, and the cross-platform C++ code that powers the client (the server piece is written in Ruby on Rails) is in its third major rewrite. Which like all good refactoring, is simpler and probably uses fewer lines of code than the previous two attempts.</p>
<p>But first, some screenshots: &#8220;Subscribed highlights&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/bookshelf_subscribed.png and &#8220;Sharing&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/bookshelf_sharing.png.</p>
<p>The architecture is based on the &#8220;Simple Sharing Extensions&#8221;:http://msdn.microsoft.com/xml/rss/sse/ (SSE) for RSS and OPML. On top of that we have added a VitalSource namespace and a few extra XML elements and attributes to keep track of Bookshelf-specific data, such as highlighter color and selected text within a book. The goal is to keep it as open as possible, so that in the future we can both consume other sources of user notes, and allow third-parties to also hook into the data in interesting ways.</p>
<p>We (computer users in general) are all writing bits of notes and data in various applications and for the most part, it&#8217;s a mess. We switch applications frequently, databases and file formats change, and there&#8217;s no good way to move data between applications. Imagine instead that you could have bookmarks and short snippets of text easily sync between apps like Del.icio.us, NetNewsWire, Yojimbo, Flickr, and Bookshelf. Ultimately the only requirement is that each item is RSS-like (it has a URI, some text, and maybe another piece of specialized data just for that app). Anyone who has been programming for the web for a few years knows that after a while, <em>everything starts to look like RSS</em>.</p>
<p>The key is simple, flexible standards. &#8220;Less Software&#8221;:http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch10_Less_Software.php, if you will. Mac OS X&#8217;s Sync Services by comparison is too complicated, too closed, and too narrowly tied to specific applications.</p>
<p>What I like best about SSE is that it provides a roadmap of sorts. It makes some assumptions about how you want to sync data and that frees you to work on more important things. Wondering how to deal with GUIDs, versioning, and deletions? Don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel, that&#8217;s in the spec.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post again when we actually ship the software, of course. Anyone else using SSE yet? If so, drop me an email. I&#8217;d love to hear how people are using this stuff.</p>

			<p>Okay, not really. But this has been a crazy and surprising week for my &#8220;little&#8221; application, Wii Transfer. Putting 8 hours each day into &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ (I have a post coming about that tomorrow, by the way) and then juggling home responsibilities, putting out various other fires, and sitting down to work on Wii Transfer until 3am is just not healthy.</p>
<p>Luckily I slept great last night and took a 3-hour nap today. So time to blog again. :-)</p>
<p>Over a week ago I released Wii Transfer 2.0 and made a big mistake, and since I&#8217;ve been programming for the Mac for over a dozen years now, I really should know better. It was buggy. And not just a few minor cosmetic problems, but at least two serious crashers. I simply had not tested enough. It&#8217;s difficult (sometimes impossible) to regain a user&#8217;s trust after their first experience with an application is a bad one, so I got to work that weekend fixing problems and releasing beta builds to customers to get a few extra eyes on the software.</p>
<p>Then Monday came, and <em>all hell broke loose</em>.</p>
<p>Links from &#8220;Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/january#mon-22-wii_transfer, &#8220;Ranchero&#8221;:http://www.ranchero.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=1523, and &#8220;The Unofficial Apple Weblog&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/01/22/wii-transfer-2-0/ were followed by &#8220;Jostiq&#8221;:http://joystiq.com/2007/01/25/wii-transfer-for-mac-os-turns-your-wii-into-a-media-center-but/, &#8220;Infendo&#8221;:http://infendo.com/2007/01/wii-media-center-software.html, &#8220;4 Color Rebellion&#8221;:http://4colorrebellion.com/archives/2007/01/22/wii-transfer-for-mac-reaches-20/, and a bunch of others. Ironically one of the only gaming sites I read that never linked to Wii Transfer was the only one I had actually sent an announcement to (&#8220;GoNintendo&#8221;:http://www.gonintendo.com/). Traffic and sales were way up (&#8220;here&#8217;s a Mint screenshot&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/riverfold_mint.png from one day last week).</p>
<p>But meanwhile, the application was just not that stable. I started rewriting most of the web server inside Wii Transfer and fixing lots of issues with iTunes and iPhoto libraries stored on external drives. Then I made my second mistake: I added a feature (album cover artwork!). Obviously, adding a feature in the middle of bug fixes just delays the original fixes and introduces new problems.</p>
<p>I also quickly realized how many things could go wrong with how music and picture sharing works. It relies on the Nintendo Wii and your Mac being on the same local network. Because Wii Transfer pings a bookmark server to register your IP address, you also have to make sure the app picks the right IP if your Mac is on both ethernet and wireless networks. Worse, many people have the Mac OS X built-in firewall enabled, so users are required to manually open up port 9000.</p>
<p>At one point on Tuesday when sales were coming in, every time I received a PayPal notification email I literally groaned. &#8220;Stop buying this software until I can make it work reliably,&#8221; I would say to the computer. The thing that got me through was that all customers who sent in support email were extremely helpful and patient. The other good news is that with version 2.1.1, it&#8217;s looking pretty solid, and the next update should wrap up any remaining fringe issues.</p>
<p>To everyone who gave Wii Transfer a try, thanks! I think you&#8217;ll like what comes next.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I finished &#8220;Wii Transfer 2.0&#8243;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ late Thursday night. This version is an interesting milestone for the application because it goes beyond just using the SD card to shuttle data back and forth between your Mac and Wii. There is a small Cocoa web server embedded inside Wii Transfer that can serve up MP3s and JPEGs directly to the Wii using the Internet Channel. I think this could be the basis for some really fun stuff in the future.</p>
<p>One of the things I added at the last minute is to try to simplify how you connect to your Mac from the Wii. IP addresses are difficult to memorize for most people and may change depending on how your home network is setup. To solve this, Wii Transfer will optionally create a permanent URL for you on bookmark.riverfold.com. You can then add that URL as a favorite for your Wii and it will always redirect to your local machine. Wii Transfer will ping the Riverfold server on startup and update the bookmark database with your current IP address. You can think of it as a simplified version of &#8220;Dynamic DNS&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS.</p>
<p>I just noticed that Wii Transfer is the featured download and staff pick in the &#8220;video section of Apple&#8217;s download site&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/video/. That is a nice surprise. It will be interesting to see what that does to download stats.</p>
<p>One last thing. Starting next month the price will go up to $14 for version 2.0 (free upgrade for all existing users). I usually work on Wii Transfer at night, so the increase will help offset all the sleep I lost. :-) Even at $14 it may be underpriced. Remember the &#8220;Brent Simmons rule&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/168/the-price-is-wrong: anything less than $20 won&#8217;t be taken seriously. In this case though I think it&#8217;s just about right. I&#8217;m also finding a large percentage of purchases from Europe, despite no localization, probably because the US dollar is so weak now. Enjoy!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Last week I said&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/macworld_2007_predictions.html I wasn&#8217;t interested in an iPod phone, unless it was something no one had even thought to expect. Well, it is. I am blown away by the iPhone. <i>The thing runs <strike>Mac</strike> OS X.</i></p>
<p>The iPhone is really inspirational in terms of UI design polish. You can tell they put some years into it. I was playing with Tiger&#8217;s NSAnimation the other night (sort of a poor man&#8217;s &#8220;Core Animation&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/coreanimation.html), and it reinforced for me the fact that UI effects are no longer optional pieces of software design. They can both visually supplement the user interaction and just make the application experience more enjoyable. &#8220;Disco&#8221;:http://www.discoapp.com/, for all the criticism as a glorified Disk Recording framework wrapper, is fun to use. Same goes for the just-released &#8220;Snapshot 2.0&#8243;:http://www.stuntsoftware.com/Snapshot/, which has a really thoughtful single-window UI.</p>
<p>This is going to be another great year to be a Mac developer. And we haven&#8217;t even seen the rest of Leopard yet. Only bump in the road will be if iPhone is a closed platform. The &#8220;comments over at Theocacao&#8221;:http://theocacao.com/document.page/404 provide some interesting commentary on that question.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>A few years ago I used &#8220;VoodooPad Lite&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/ extensively. Every note, to-do list, and feature description went into it. At some point I migrated away from VoodooPad to a combination of text files and &#8220;Ta-da list&#8221;:http://www.tadalist.com/, perhaps fearing I would have too much data in a weird format that would be difficult to get at later.</p>
<p>But I was always on the lookout for a problem that would best be solved with VoodooPad again. With our localized help files for &#8220;Bookshelf 4.1&#8243;:http://www.vitalsource.com/, I tried for most of a day to use VoodooPad to manage the help. I even experimented with Gus&#8217;s dead &#8220;project for remote wiki editing&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi?space=3ec82d22-c72a-01d9-1639-c0cbe4c4c32b, thinking I would write my own web-based help-specific wiki system and plug &#8220;Boomerang&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi/348c223e-0512-01da-1c41-c0cbe4c4fc75 into it. In the end it was too difficult to force the existing static help files into VoodooPad.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to a few nights ago. &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ 1.5 has no Apple Help at all, and it needs some. A perfect opportunity for VoodooPad, and I&#8217;m happy to report that the solution works beautifully. I knew I could make it work because clearly VoodooPad&#8217;s own help files are managed with VoodooPad. After a bit of experimentation I bought a new VoodooPad license and all was well in the world.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>I manage the help content in VoodooPad, creating pages for different help sections and generally just typing away and getting stuff done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HTML export template lives inside the VoodooPad document itself, so everything is in one place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also inside the VoodooPad document is a post-processing script (written in Ruby) that looks for a comment in index.html and inserts the appropriate AppleTitle and AppleIcon meta tags that Apple Help needs to get its work done.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The only part I haven&#8217;t finished yet is that the script should also send the files off to Help Indexer to update the search index. I coded that part but it doesn&#8217;t work yet &#8212; there is something different about how VoodooPad executes these scripts that prevents other applications from launching. (Maybe. I&#8217;ll sort it out eventually.)</p>
<p>You can &#8220;watch a screencast of the process here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/screencasts/2007/voodoopad.mov. I add a new page, enter some filler text, export the VoodooPad document, then re-run the Xcode project and view the changes in Apple Help. Fun!</p>

			<p>Watching from the sidelines as Dan Benjamin prepared his first podcast really made me want to get out &#8220;the microphone&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/194992192/ again. Creating a podcast is a great experience, and I always tell myself I&#8217;ll do them more frequently. There have been a few recent events that I&#8217;ve wanted to capture as podcast episodes, including the experience waiting in line for the Wii, but it just hasn&#8217;t come together.</p>
<p>Enough about me. Go listen to &#8220;The Hivelogic Podcast with Dan Benjamin&#8221;:http://www.hivelogic.com/articles/2007/01/06/podcast_is_here, interviewing &#8220;John Gruber&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/ about the upcoming Macworld announcements.

			<p>&#8220;Dan covers his Macworld predictions&#8221;:http://hivelogic.com/articles/2007/01/04/macworld_2007 in great detail. Instead of predictions, since mine will probably be wrong, I&#8217;m going to list what I <em>want</em> to see:</p>
<p><em>Tablet.</em> I tend to agree with &#8220;Steven Frank&#8217;s analysis&#8221;:http://stevenf.com/2007/01/wherein_i_predict_the_future.php more than &#8220;this former Apple exec&#8221;:http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1981815,00.html, but either way it remains pretty unlikely that a tablet is going to happen under Steve Job&#8217;s watch. At WWDC once Steve Jobs called the Newton a &#8220;little scribbly thing&#8221; or something similar, and it wasn&#8217;t long before he officially gave that division the axe.</p>
<p><em>Numbers.</em> Some people still insist on sending me Excel documents. We need a simple application in the iWork suite that can natively read/write Excel documents and handle the basics.</p>
<p><em>Finder.</em> I&#8217;m pretty sure Leopard will sport a new Finder, as well as user interface candy paint applied across the operating system. The only question is whether they&#8217;ve rewritten it from scratch and in the process introduced even more problems. I&#8217;m optimistic on this one, though, and expect an elegant UI evolution from the Finder team.</p>
<p>What I don&#8217;t care about:</p>
<p><em>iTV.</em> See &#8220;previous post about DRM&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/goodbye_itms.html. If I want to watch a movie, I&#8217;ll put in a DVD. However, I do hope to draw some inspiration from whatever they do and apply it to &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ development.</p>
<p><em>iPod Phone.</em> I have no doubt it will be well designed, but it will also be at least $299 (guess). I have only owned a couple mobile phones in my life, and they were free or nearly free. The iPod Phone will have to be something no one&#8217;s even thought of yet for me to consider it. It&#8217;s kind of like &#8220;Nike + iPod&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/ipod/nike/, a luxury that I don&#8217;t really need.</p>
<p>Anyway, should be a fun Macworld. I haven&#8217;t been in years and I&#8217;m a little jealous of those who are attending this year. (But not jealous enough to want to get on a plane next week.) Part of me misses the old days, having a booth and talking with users or seeing what was new on the show floor. I was at the first Macworld keynote after Steve Jobs came back to Apple, while Gil Amelio was still in charge, and I&#8217;ll always remember it as something pretty special.</p>

			<p>When I started on the &#8220;music sharing feature&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/holiday_hacking.html in the upcoming 2.0 release of Wii Transfer, I knew it couldn&#8217;t support protected songs from the iTunes Music Store. Still, it was disappointing when I started using it and such a big chunk of my favorite music was inaccessible. The only DRM problem I&#8217;ve ever run into before now is forgetting to deactivate old machines and hitting the 5-machine limit, but that&#8217;s easily solved, and I have been quick to defend iTMS and promote its convenience to others.</p>
<p>No longer. Overnight my music library has become much less valuable, just because I chose to use it in a different way. Almost all the music I&#8217;ve bought in the last couple of years is from iTunes. I created two smart playlists, one to show protected and one not. Apparently of the 5000 songs on this computer, 500 of them are from iTunes. <em>10%.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what is going to replace my use of iTunes yet, but for now I think I&#8217;ll lean on Amazon Prime&#8217;s free 2-day shipping and just order and rip CDs to good old fashioned high-bitrate MP3s. Too bad, because I do love the iTunes experience. Just gotta keep repeating to myself: text files, JPEGs, and MP3s are forever. Everything else is suspect.</p>
