			<p>&#8220;NetNewsWire is free&#8221;:http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3461 (congrats again Brent!) and reaction is coming in from other indie developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rory Prior&#8221;:http://www.thinkmac.co.uk/blog/2008/01/scorched-earth.html: &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to compete with a product that&#8217;s as well known and frankly as good as NNW, it&#8217;s damn near impossible to compete with it when it&#8217;s free.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Paul Kafasis&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Article/NNWFree-2008-01-09-19-00.html: &#8220;When something is given away for free, its perceived value is lowered. If software is treated as valueless, it becomes much, much harder to sell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to have a significant negative impact as far as devaluating other software (except of course other news readers) because most people paying attention should connect that it supports Newsgator&#8217;s core business model. But rather than debate the issue I searched my archives to see what else I had said about the product. It must be one of the most-blogged-about apps ever, right? I&#8217;m limiting it to 1 post per year.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I received a lot of feedback after &#8220;I first wrote about the Kindle&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/11/kindle.html, so here&#8217;s an update. I admit I&#8217;m still trying to understand the device; it has not immediately fallen into a spot in my routine the way the iPod and iPhone did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan Benjamin&#8221;:http://www.hivelogic.com/ pointed out that it&#8217;s wrong to compare the Kindle and iPhone because they are two completely separate kinds of devices, and that&#8217;s true. But the fact remains that Amazon could have partnered with AT&amp;T and required a monthly fee for connectivity. Instead they chose to eat that cost to provide a seamless user experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Willie Abrams&#8221;:http://willie.tumblr.com/ bought a Kindle and then returned it, unhappy with both the contrast on the device and the slow page turns. As I pointed out in my original post, the page turns are annoying, but they won&#8217;t ruin the device for most people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andy Ihnatko&#8221;:http://ihnatko.com/ wrote glowingly about the Kindle and spoke at length on MacBreak Weekly about the free wireless and adequate web browser. Personally I have found the web browser to be extremely poor and the slow refresh inappropriate for modern, interactive sites. I didn&#8217;t even realize it came with a browser when I ordered it, though, so I consider it a nice bonus.</p>
<p>When I left town to take a week and a half holiday road trip with my family, I decided to leave the Kindle at home. After all, I already had my MacBook, iPhone, Nintendo DS, and a hardback book that would easily fill the week. The Kindle is small but it would just be wasted clutter in my backpack.</p>
<p>This turned out to be a mistake. For one, I had spotty Edge coverage in middle-of-nowhere West Texas, and it would have been an interesting experiment to see how the Kindle&#8217;s EVDO faired in other cities. But more importantly, while checking blogs someone recommended a book that I was interested in. I clicked through to Amazon and noticed that it was available in Kindle format. It would have been the perfect opportunity to buy it and start reading right away.</p>
<p>That is what the Kindle brings to the table. The hardware design is not an improvement over the Sony Reader (the Kindle&#8217;s keyboard remains a definite mistake), but the integration with Amazon and the convenient downloads from anywhere are both well implemented. I think Amazon has a history of tinkering in public view (home page design, shipping experiments), and the Kindle is no exception. They&#8217;re no doubt already working on version 2.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;David Heinemeier Hansson writes in detail&#8221;:http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/21-the-deal-with-shared-hosts on the problems with Rails in shared hosts:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most Rails contributors are not big users of shared hosting and they tend to work on problems or enhancements that&#8217;ll benefit their own usage of the framework. You don&#8217;t have to have a degree in formal logic to deduce that work to improve life on shared hosting is not exactly a top priority for these people, myself included.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve been building Rails apps for a couple years, and will continue to do so, I made the choice with &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ to go PHP-only so that I could deploy on inexpensive shared hosts and easily move my sites. Fact is, you need to dedicate a significant portion of your time to being a system administrator if you run a Rails site.</p>
<p>I find the general &#8220;we don&#8217;t owe you anything&#8221; attitude in the Rails community off-putting. What it means is quite simple: Rails is not a product, despite what it might look like when you &#8220;visit the web site&#8221;:http://www.rubyonrails.com/. This is fine and consistent with the opinionated nature of Rails (which from a design perspective is what makes Rails excellent), but it also means that features like backwards compatibility are not just ignored but actively discouraged. The message this sends is that the core team values their own personal productivity over the productivity of the general Rails userbase.</p>
<p>Also, make no mistake, the performance questions surrounding Rails are directly related to the web shared host issue. Rails can&#8217;t be hosted in the same way that PHP is hosted because it takes so long for a Rails application to be initialized, requiring dedicated long-running app instances and an ever-changing array of &#8220;best practice&#8221; solutions starting with mod_ruby to FCGI to Mongrel to &#8220;Thin&#8221;:http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/.</p>
<p>My friends and &#8220;co-workers&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ are no doubt sick of me bashing Rails (see &#8220;this post on the priorities of the community&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/09/rails_and_mac_dev.html), but I still admire Rails and do want to see these problems solved. I would love to use &#8220;PotionStore&#8221;:http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore to power the Riverfold site, or to base my registration database and sales tracking in Rails.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Obama is passionate, thoughtful, centrist enough for broad appeal, and a brilliant speaker. If he&#8217;s the nominee I&#8217;ll support him fully with every bit of strength I have. There is something special about him, and it comes around rarely in a candidate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave Winer wrote&#8221;:http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/01/08/gluedToTheTv.html: &#8220;Obama, like Carter in 1976, may be our pennance for having re-elected Bush in 2004. We&#8217;re taking the medicine we deserve for having been crazy enough to re-elect someone who was so bad for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what about Hillary? She&#8217;s part of the establishment, and I volunteered heavily for the Howard Dean campaign. Could I support someone as traditional as Hillary? As &#8220;Mike Cohen said&#8221;:http://mcdevzone.com/2008/01/08/bad-news-from-new-hampshire: &#8220;I oppose her very strongly, not only because of all the baggage she brings, but for her anti-progressive record.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I posted to Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/578006692 on election night that something had changed between the Iowa vote and New Hampshire: Hillary had found her voice, and it surprised me. Turns out she knows what is at stake. I always knew she was a fighter; after 2000 and 2004, we need the Democrats to show some backbone again. But I think she&#8217;s been underestimated even more deeply than that, in her ability to speak to the core Democratic base while drawing upon her new experience and record in the Senate that most people aren&#8217;t familiar with yet.</p>
<p>And then there is the woman factor. Some people will say this matters but they don&#8217;t really understand unless they have daughters of their own, daughters who will grow up and become teenagers, the defining moment of their lives, during a woman presidency. This is both personal and huge and it could spread like wildfire. For me, it tips the balance.</p>
<p>My family is throwing its support &mdash; our money for donations, our phones for getting out the vote, and our voice &mdash; behind Hillary. Thank you New Hampshire for making this a real primary election again.</p>

			<p>Wii Transfer&#8217;s featured day for &#8220;MacSanta&#8221;:http://www.macsantadeals.com/ starts at midnight tonight, but I&#8217;ve already rolled out the coupon code. Because I&#8217;m still using simple PayPal &#8220;Buy Now&#8221; buttons, I hacked together a little custom coupon field just for MacSanta (based on a simple JavaScript trick posted to the MacSB list). I tried to come up with a clear interface even though there isn&#8217;t a traditional online store, because it just doesn&#8217;t make sense to spend time on a full store for only one product. (Plus, look at that cute MacSanta logo! Aww.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot &#8220;from the web site&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ after you&#8217;ve redeemed a code:</p>

I was initially worried because he didn&#8217;t respond until well into the second day after I notified him, but he was pretty excited (&#8220;You&#8217;ve made my holiday&#8221;) and I&#8217;m glad it could ship out before Christmas. The picture here is in the car before I went into the UPS store to fill the box with peanuts.</p>
<p>The promotion took a surprising amount of effort, but it was fun and definitely worthwhile. There were a total of 2447 unique submissions (1925 for the email form, and 522 from Twitter). Of those, over 1/3 agreed to sign up for my annual Riverfold Software newsletter. I consider that alone a success, although until I look at the stats more closely it&#8217;s not clear what percentage of potential-customers are actually using Macs. My &#8220;Wii Twitter account&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii also doubled to about 300 followers.</p>
<p>Although sales were initially flat, both &#8220;TUAW&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/12/05/wii-transfer-maker-giving-away-a-wii/ and &#8220;Ars Technica&#8221;:http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/12/06/win-a-wii-to-go-with-your-wii-transfer-for-mac ran nice stories on the promotion. I also &#8220;wrote a press release&#8221;:http://riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/press/giveaway.html, with the idea of hitting some of the bigger gaming sites for the second week of the contest. In the end I decided not to, because I wanted to focus on Mac users, and because frankly there were plenty of submissions and I was burned out on the process.</p>
<p>The contest easily paid for itself, but the extra sales really weren&#8217;t that significant. I have a database that tracks referrers through to the actual purchase, so I noticed an increase of only about 10-20 copies out of the 100 sales for the month so far. Part of that is no doubt the catch-22 of giving away hardware that is required for your software product, but I know that long-term there will be a benefit to the wider exposure.</p>
<p>Mistakes? I should have made the whole promotion last just a day or two, and hyped it before launching instead. I also should have required that Twitter users follow Wii before entering, which would have boosted those followers and also greatly simplified tracking submissions (replies were spread over 3 RSS feeds and 33 iChat log transcripts). Relatively minor complaints, though, overall.</p>
<p>To everyone who provided feedback on the idea, thanks. Maybe next year I&#8217;ll implement some of the more interesting promotion ideas I heard.</p>

			<p>A few months ago I was in Target and they had some Wiis in stock, so on an impulse I bought one. I&#8217;ve owned a Wii since launch day, but I had this idea to give one away for Christmas as an experiment to help promote Wii Transfer. I sat on the idea for a while, listened to feedback from others, and finally &#8220;rolled it out this morning&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/giveaway/ with two methods to enter: web form (with field to notify a friend about the giveaway) and via Twitter (by sending a reply to @wii).</p>
<p>Unfortunately there was a major snag with the Twitter idea. It turns out that @wii replies won&#8217;t show up in my Replies tab (or RSS feed) in Twitter unless the user posting the tweet is already following &#8220;twitter.com/wii&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii. I now regret not making that a requirement, but I also know that it would have hurt the simplicity of entering via Twitter.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the solution? For now, a combination of things. I am now tracking every tweet that contains &#8220;wii&#8221; (try it, there are some fun ones), which I will aggregate with the standard replies as well as results from a search on &#8220;Terraminds&#8221;:http://terraminds.com/twitter/ to fill in any of the tweets I missed. It&#8217;s all a bit cumbersome because the tracking results come through IM (luckily iChat transcripts are XML now).</p>
<p>It feels very fragile, but hopefully I won&#8217;t miss any entries. There&#8217;s no cost to submitting multiple times, so consider sending another @wii tweet next week or entering with the web form to guarantee you&#8217;re in the drawing. If in doubt, re-read the &#8220;last line on the fine print&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/giveaway/.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>All we do at &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ is e-books, from working with publishers on converting their content to our format, to managing the delivery of digital files and building the web-based infrastructure to support it, and finally to designing and coding the Mac and Windows applications for reading and annotating books. My &#8220;Kindle&#8221;:http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Device/dp/B000FI73MA arrived on Tuesday, the day after it was released, and here are my initial thoughts after using it over the Thanksgiving weekend.</p>
<p><em>Out-of-box experience.</em> Amazon really nailed the first-use experience. The Kindle came in a nice box and was pre-configured with my Amazon account. No syncing or setup necessary; you can start reading books immediately.</p>
<p><em>Screen.</em> If you haven&#8217;t seen an e-ink device &mdash; actually held one in your hands, like the Sony Reader &mdash; don&#8217;t bother &#8220;reviewing&#8221; it. The iPhone screen is beautiful and I would love to have a small Mac tablet, something even a little bigger than the Kindle, but for reading books, nothing beats e-ink. It&#8217;s in a whole different class, and this is one of the areas where the Kindle shines. (It says a lot that the first FAQ item in the Kindle manual is about how the screen &#8220;flicker&#8221; when flipping pages is normal, though. It&#8217;s a little distracting but not a show-stopper.)</p>
<p><em>Connectivity.</em> Amazon has been innovating with free shipping for years, so in a way it&#8217;s perfectly consistent to also offer free wireless connectivity. As a long-time Apple fan, I&#8217;m a little disappointed that Amazon is the one innovating with service plans, while Apple is stuck in the past with service contracts and high monthly fees with silly text message caps. I pay about $80/month for the privilege of using my iPhone; with the Kindle, I pay only for purchased content.</p>
<p><em>Purchasing.</em> You can buy books from Amazon on your computer or from the Kindle itself, and I&#8217;ve tried both. My first purchase was using Safari on my Mac, and less than a minute later the book &#8220;magically&#8221; appeared on my Kindle. Again, no cables or sync necessary; the Kindle notices a book purchase and downloads it wirelessly.</p>
<p><em>Hardware.</em> It couldn&#8217;t all be good news, could it? The button design is where the Kindle just falls on its face, and it&#8217;s bad news for both major areas of the device: the keyboard and the page navigation buttons. I just don&#8217;t see how they justified taking up so much room for the keyboard, because in truth you almost never need to use it. For the page buttons, try handing someone a Kindle for the first time and the first thing they do is accidentally hit next or previous page. It takes a while to train yourself on the best way to hold the Kindle.</p>
<p>There are other things I could say &mdash; about DRM (unavoidable) or emailing documents to the device (clever) or the book cover (clunky) &mdash; but I want to keep this short. Despite it&#8217;s flaws, the Kindle is a good device, and it goes beyond being the first usable e-book reader to offer seamless purchasing and book delivery from Amazon&#8217;s large selection. It&#8217;s not as polished a 1.0 as the iPhone release was, but it&#8217;s a solid offering and more innovative in some ways. I&#8217;m looking forward to both reading books on it as a user and experimenting with ways to get other content on the device as a developer.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Steven Frank&#8221;:http://stevenf.com/2007/11/try_again.php on Google&#8217;s phone announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Find someone, ONE person, with a unique vision. Lock them in a room with some programmers and a graphic designer. Twenty people, tops. Change the world. Quit re-hashing the same old bullshit and telling me it&#8217;s new, exciting, or in any way innovative. Be ready to fail, many times, but for love of all that is holy take a stand on something.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I heard about the Google phone consortium pretty much exclusively through Twitter, and the reaction seems about universal from the folks I follow (admittedly, half of them are total Mac geeks). I&#8217;m honestly not sure how the Google phone is relevant to me, but then again, I don&#8217;t like Gmail.</p>
<p>Although this week&#8217;s &#8220;37signals post on personas&#8221;:http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/690-ask-37signals-personas isn&#8217;t about Android, some of the points are relevant to committee-led design:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can build a great product for a person that doesn&#8217;t exist. And I definitely don&#8217;t think you can build a great product based on a composite sketch of 10 different people all rolled into one (or two or three).&#8221; [&#8230;] &#8220;Every product we build is a product we build for ourselves to solve our own problems.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Not using your own product can turn into a real problem, and I realized after I bought an Apple TV that &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ suffered from it. So I forced myself to use my own product instead, and that made all the difference. Plus, it was easy to unplug the Apple TV because the thing got so hot I was worried it would burn the house down while I slept.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>So I am 5 days or 700 characters in to my <a href="http://www.story140.com/">Story 140 experiment</a>. Even though separation between each tweet is only implied, this is the end of the first paragraph, and on the web site I will be formatting it that way.</p>
<p>If you were to put the ideas you have in life into two buckets &#8212; and I don&#8217;t meant the little one-off ideas, I mean the big ones you care about and could passionately defend &#8212; you might divide them into ideas which are truly great, and ideas which sound great. The key here is to avoid the ideas which are neither great nor which sound particularly good at all. It&#8217;s too early to know which one of these idea types Story 140 is, but at this point I&#8217;m leaning toward the &#8220;sounds great&#8221; side.</p>
<p>Put simply, writing something 140 characters at a time is <em>exactly opposite</em> to the way I normally write. It is much more challenging than I thought, and after 2 days I immediately wanted to start cheating and writing a bunch ahead, so that the story flowed properly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep at it, but I did realize that I have to at least partially plan what the story is about. I have only a vague idea in my head, but as I give it some more thought I will probably jot down notes so that when it comes time to write the tweet each day I know a little bit about where it is going. Even so, please don&#8217;t expect greatness from this work of fiction. You will be disappointed.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I have received feedback (see &#8220;Ryan Irelan&#8217;s post&#8221;:http://www.ryanirelan.com/past/2007/11/03/story-140/) that it would be great for multiple people to contribute. As I said about NaNoWriMo, what makes some of these projects work is the community. I&#8217;d love to open up this concept, and I can turn the web site into more of an aggregator of sorts. If anyone has suggestions, please email me.</p>

			<p>November is National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo), but I&#8217;m way too busy to participate this year. (See &#8220;my wrap-up post from 2005&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2005/12/50136_words.html for the last time I did it.) I would love to write <em>something</em>, though. Maybe I should consider &#8220;Ficlets&#8221;:http://ficlets.com/ or a similar site, but I&#8217;ve had Twitter on the brain lately. Why not take the embracing constraints approach and write a story through Twitter?</p>
<p>Introducing &#8220;Story 140&#8221;:http://www.story140.com/, a new web site and &#8220;Twitter account&#8221;:http://twitter.com/story140 where I will be writing a short story in 140 characters a day for 140 days. To make things interesting I set a few rules for myself (listed on the site), including that every tweet must be written the day it is posted and be reasonably grammatically correct while still exactly 140 characters. (I say &#8220;reasonably&#8221; because there will be the occasional use of incomplete sentences, and some people may question my spelling of dialog without the ending &#8220;ue&#8221;. That must be influenced by years of programming the old Mac toolbox.)</p>
<p>Even though it is extremely serialized, my hope is that the resulting story will actually be readable. We&#8217;ll have to see how successful I end up being at that goal. It&#8217;s already more challenging than I expected; the first tweet took me about 10 minutes to write, and the second one even longer.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Twiterrific 3.0&#8221;:http://iconfactory.com/home/permalink/1887 is out, with a new price of $15 or free to use with ads. The ads are very effective and difficult to ignore, but really they don&#8217;t take anything away from the Twitter experience. The new version is great, though, and I&#8217;ll be sending my $15 to Icon Factory sometime in the next few days. &#8220;As Fraser Speirs said&#8221;:http://speirs.org/2007/11/02/twitterrific-3/, it&#8217;s a small price to pay to be connected to friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>I post to Twitter much more often than I blog now, and I think I owe some of my followers an explanation. I made a rule for myself early on to <em>only follow people who I have met in real life</em>. I&#8217;ve only made a couple exceptions to this, and none recently. It keeps the flow of tweets easier to manage and relevant.</p>
<p>So if you follow me on Twitter and wonder why I don&#8217;t return the favor, that is why. You probably have interesting things to say, so say hi to me at some future conference so I can add you to my list. I&#8217;ve actually been thinking about taking it one step further and protecting updates, because I tend to post about what (to this blog) have been traditionally private matters. Jury is still out on that decision.</p>
<p>The following numbers are interesting, though. I only do very basic Mint stats for this blog (I just care about referrers, not number of readers), but it does make me wonder how many people read this blog. If you&#8217;re reading this, add a comment to this post. (Haha, gotcha! I don&#8217;t have comments.)</p>

			<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a politically-themed post. Probably the only one before 2008, so don&#8217;t run away just yet.</p>
<p>The Bush veto of the bipartisan children&#8217;s health care plan a few weeks ago really made me angry, but it wasn&#8217;t until &#8220;Justin Miller responded&#8221;:http://twitter.com/incanus77/statuses/310113392 to &#8220;my tweet&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/310110182 that I started to think about why. Here&#8217;s the reason.</p>
<p>When Bush was elected in 2000, I expected this kind of stuff from him. Vetoing stem cell research? Killing children&#8217;s health care funding? Sure, par for the course for this Republican. But then 9-11 happened and everything changed. The war. Our president&#8217;s priorities changed.</p>
<p>Bush got a free ride from the media during the 2000 election, and again after 9-11. He would make the most incompetent and clumsy mistakes and yet be cut slack because, frankly, expectations are just so much lower for him than any other president in recent history.</p>
<p>At some point in 2004, opinion started to shift, led by folks like Howard Dean (who I&#8217;ve &#8220;written about before&#8221;:http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amanton.org+howard+dean). Eventually, after Bush won re-election, there would be enough anti-war momentum to matter. And that brings us up to now and this veto.</p>
<p>Everyone is focused on the war. Everyone understands the significance, the mistakes. Most of the country wants it over but we know that it&#8217;s complex, and the consequences for any given action will be felt for a decade. Compared to the lives lost in Iraq and the harm done to the stability of the Middle East, the rise of a new generation of terrorists &#8212; what does a health care bill matter? Is it worth fighting for?</p>
<p>Democrats in power by a slim majority probably think they have to choose their battles, have to give in on some issues so they can hold on to the important ones, like the war. But I say no. The only thing that works against this stubborn ass in the White House is to take the fight to him. Cut him off at every turn. Don&#8217;t give him a freakin&#8217; inch. Call for an override vote again and again.</p>
<p>Every. Single. Day.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how you win. You put people on the ground in every state &#8212; organizing, protesting, getting out the vote. You put letters in the hands of our representatives &#8212; email, blogs, editorial, flyers. You put a loud voice to what you feel and never, ever back down.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Happy Halloween! &#8220;Wii Transfer 2.5.2&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ is now available. This is probably one of the most difficult bug fix releases I&#8217;ve done. Full changes are in &#8220;the release notes&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/releasenotes/, but the biggest stuff includes fixed Leopard UI glitches and a new 2-pass encoding that should result in much more consistent movie streaming quality. Along the way I touched most of the corners of the product, including many hours of trial-and-error debugging the Flash FLV player component.</p>
<p>While testing Wii Transfer on my TV the other day I had a moment to reflect on how this product has evolved. What started as a one-weekend hack has grown into something quite a bit more complex. It has a few rough edges, sure, but I&#8217;m proud of this little app and how I&#8217;ve been able to put a simple UI on all these different technologies (embedded web server, HTML/JavaScript/Flash UI, MP3 and FLV conversion, iLife integration, etc). I have a few new features planned and in various stages of development, but I think the just-released 2.5.2 is going to start a trend of refinement; there&#8217;s a lot I could do to improve the movie conversion and streaming experience before introducing anything radically new.</p>
<p>So, Leopard. I had originally planned to just wipe my old Leopard seed partition on the MacBook and test the GM, but at the last minute I dove full in and did an upgrade install on my primary machine, the Mac Pro. I have nightly SuperDuper clones just in case, but the upgrade was completely smooth. It&#8217;s a great OS foundation and I can&#8217;t wait to see what other developers have been working on.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>After I shipped Wii Transfer 2.5 I decided to start spending a little time promoting the product. Every month or so I&#8217;ll do some small thing to improve sales. Last month that was a &#8220;press release&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/press/2.5.html, followed by the &#8220;ad on The Talk Show&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/10/the_talk_show.html, and next month I&#8217;ll be giving away a brand new Nintendo Wii as a holiday promotion.</p>
<p>Today Wii Transfer is on sale at &#8220;macZOT&#8221;:http://www.maczot.com/ for the incredibly low price of just $9 (half off!). To be honest I have mixed feelings about these kind of promotions, and the first time macZOT approached me about it I declined. I worry that it can reinforce a message that all software should be cheap &#8212; that even $19 is too expensive &#8212; but on the other hand it&#8217;s great exposure to an audience that might not otherwise hear about Wii Transfer.</p>
<p>Lisa at macZOT has been great to work with, letting me set the price (even though I get a small fraction of what a normal sale would be, I felt it was important to do the promotion to its fullest and go below $10), and making sure macZOT pings my backend script so that serial numbers go out to customers right away. I know people can be frustrated if they have to wait to receive the product, and I also have a new serial number lookup form on the site that ties into all of this quite nicely.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fun experiment. If you&#8217;ve been thinking about purchasing Wii Transfer but thought it was too expensive, head over to macZOT to pick up your copy. The &#8220;discussion page&#8221;:http://maczot.com/discuss/?p=563 will probably have some comments too.</p>

			<p>Late notice, but I&#8217;ll have a watercolor piece in tonight&#8217;s Monster Mash art show at the Lowbrow Emporium on South Lamar. If you&#8217;re in Austin, drop by between 7 and 11pm and say hi. (Address and other details on &#8220;the poster by Jason Chalker&#8221;:http://austinsketchsquad.blogspot.com/2007/09/they-did-mashit-was-monster-mash.html.) The art is from participants and friends of the Austin Sketch Squad, some of whom will be doing live art at the show. There will also be free beer and candy!</p>
<p>I snapped a &#8220;photo of my desk with art stuff&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/1558857105/ while I was preparing for the show. I forgot to scan the final art, which sadly didn&#8217;t come out nearly as nice as my first sketch, but I&#8217;ll get a picture of that tonight. It was fun to work on and a nice break from late-night programming this week.</p>

			<p>Ambrosia Software&#8217;s &#8220;Andrew Welch in a TUAW interview&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/10/03/tuaw-interview-ambrosias-andrew-welch-on-the-iphone-update-and/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The tack they are taking with the ringtones, though, is not &#8216;We&#8217;ll provide such great ringtones that you&#8217;ll want to buy from us&#8217; but rather &#8216;This is all you&#8217;re ever going to be able to use, too bad if you want to use something else.&#8217; I think they took a winning formula, and got it entirely backwards.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the most disappointing part of what Apple is doing. Even with the iTunes Store, when they had to lock down the songs to appease the music industry, they still thought about the user: songs on 5 machines, unlimited iPods, multiple iTunes accounts on the same machine, great selection, and effortless buying experience. I can wait for a real iPhone SDK (WWDC 2008 please Apple kthxbye), but Apple of all companies should not let corporate deals needlessly cripple the ringtone user experience.</p>
