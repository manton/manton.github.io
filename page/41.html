			<p>So I finished rereading Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire in anticipation of the 4th film, which we just saw last night. (Thanks <a href="http://www.damonclinkscales.com/">Damon</a> for remembering to buy tickets a month early.) The film did a great job of capturing the important points of the book, while pushing the plot along at a very quick pace. The first half dozen chapters seemed to slip by in only five minutes of screen time. I was wondering how they were going to squeeze 800 pages into two and a half hours, but they did it.</p>
<p>Overhead while Traci was reading the book: &#8220;It&#8217;s weird&#8230; Hermione seems so much more like a Hufflepuff.&#8221;</p>

The Nintendo WiFi network was a little flaky last night, but things are running smoothly today.

			<p>A few weeks ago I heard about <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, a month-long &#8220;contest&#8221; to write a novel. You start November 1st, end at midnight November 30th, and if you&#8217;ve amassed 50,000 words, you win. Of course there are a lot of winners, and no prizes, but it&#8217;s a great idea and I think really helps push people in ways they didn&#8217;t think possible.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t planning on entering, even though I&#8217;ve tinkered with trying to write a novel before now. It&#8217;s hard work, and it&#8217;s easy to get stuck up on plot problems or run out of ideas and abandon the whole thing. That&#8217;s the last thing I have time for. I brought up NaNoWriMo in discussion a few days ago and I talked about it as something that other people were doing, not something I was crazy enough to try.</p>
<p>But three days into the month, I added it to <a href="http://www.43things.com/person/manton">my 43things</a> and started writing. I&#8217;m way behind the recommended quota already, but I&#8217;ve just crossed the 10,000 word mark so I wanted to mark the milestone.</p>
<p>Most of the novels, especially mine, won&#8217;t be very good. They have plot problems, weak characters, and half of them are made up as they go along. I&#8217;m 8 chapters into it and only have a vague idea of what will happen from one chapter to the next. I did absolutely no planning upfront.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s like a marathon. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you look good when you cross the finish line.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about <i>setting unreasonable deadlines</i>. They force you to stop procrastinating and work your heart out to finish something.</p>

			<p>Steve Jobs in yesterday&#8217;s special event, discussing the white iPods:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a huge success for us, and therefore it&#8217;s time to replace it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The new iPods look great. At first I was disappointed by the $1.99 price for music videos and TV shows, but when you do the math it is only a little more than buying DVDs. And what about the small quality, only 320&#215;240? In the name of science I dropped $2 to test it.</p>
<p>Last week, thanks to eBay, I became the proud owner of 2 tickets to see U2 in Houston at the end of the month. I&#8217;ve seen every U2 tour since ZooTV over a decade ago, so I wasn&#8217;t about to let little things like &#8220;too busy&#8221; and &#8220;money&#8221; stand in the way this time. Our seats are fairly horrible, but the price was right and all that matters is that we are there.</p>
<p>So buying a U2 music video was a natural choice. The download time was reasonable. I clicked it to full-screen on my Cinema Display and sat down 6 feet away. It actually looked good. 30 frames per second doesn&#8217;t hurt either. I could definitely watch TV shows this way.</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit from the Apple event. Disney&#8217;s new CEO Bob Iger was introduced quite warmly by Steve Jobs, and Iger even joked that he still hoped an agreement could be reached between Disney and Pixar for continuing distribution of their films. Sounds like that could happen after all.</p>

To prepare I dusted off my old Laserdisc with the three original Wallace and Gromit short films, but the feature equals and surpasses those films in every way. Thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
<p>Aardman Animations fans should also seek out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0810919966/mantonorg">Creating 3d Animation</a>, a combination behind-the-scenes and how-to book out a few years ago with great stuff on model construction and movement. In the age of computer animation it takes some passion to break the mold and work hand-drawn, but even more rare is the artist who wants to follow in Nick Park&#8217;s footsteps. It&#8217;s great to see the art-form of stop-motion come alive again to hopefully inspire a new set of filmmakers.</p>
<p>Speaking of old school, just today I saw that <a href="http://mad-t-party.blogspot.com/">Hans Bacher has a weblog</a>. I&#8217;ll never forget seeing his art from the Mulan book years ago. The man is a master at composition and effortless landscapes.</p>
<p>And like a lot of animators new to blogging, he uses Blogger. If you look at my NetNewsWire subscriptions (right), you&#8217;ll see an interesting trend of Blogger and LiveJournal icons. I&#8217;m not sure what that means, if anything.</p>

			<p><i>Finally</i> I had a chance to see <a href="http://corpsebridemovie.warnerbros.com/">Corpse Bride</a> last night. Caught it at the Alamo Drafthouse, which is the only theater smart enough to show short films and other theme-appropriate clips before shows. Last night they played Vincent (Tim Burton&rsquo;s stop-motion film before he left Disney), and Devil Went Down to Georgia, among others we probably missed.</p>
<p>Corpse Bride is thoroughly Tim Burton. And while it may not become a classic like The Nightmare Before Christmas, it is still an enjoyable film and contains some really great moments. Interestingly the Corpse Bride herself probably has the most depth of any of the characters.</p>
<p>Next up to see is Wallace and Gromit, which was number one at the box office this weekend. I bet the execs in Hollywood are wondering how there could be <i>two</i> back-to-back stop-motion successes when everyone else &ldquo;knows&rdquo; computer animation is the future. (Yawn.) In related news, the Aardman Animations studio <a href="http://haraldsiepermann.blogspot.com/2005/10/sad-news-i-just-heard-that-aardman.html">appears to have burned down</a>! Tragic. Not sure what the extent of damage really was yet, but it doesn&rsquo;t sound good. <b>Update</b>: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4326286.stm">BBC has the story</a> now.</p>

The organizers of Austin City Limits Music Festival were so proud of themselves for waiting to cancel the weekend concert series, but the evacuees were less pleased &#8212; stuck in Austin at shelters because the hotels were booked for an ACL in limbo.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, people panic and grocery store shelves are almost out of canned food and bottled water. The less than 3-hour trip from Houston becomes a long full day of gas shortages and frustrated evacuees.</p>
<p>Cars are not an efficient way to transport large numbers of people, but the rail and public transportation infrastructure in this oil state is pathetic. Nightline&#8217;s Ted Koppel asked the obvious question to someone from Homeland Security, but they acted as if they didn&#8217;t even understand there was a problem. If you can&#8217;t get out of a major city with a week&#8217;s notice, how can you get out in a real emergency?</p>

			<p>Last Wednesday I wrote a rant destined for this space, I was so saddened and then upset by what was happening in Louisiana. But I let the post sit unpublished, and by the end of the week others were voicing my frustrating much better than I could have. <a href="http://home.grandecom.net/~rlander/2005_09_01_archive#112562532064206016">Randy Lander used profanity</a>, <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?messageDate=2005-09-02">Michael Moore raised the National Guard question</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/01/opinion/01thu1.html?ex=1283227200&amp;en=abe5e2ccb6821298&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss">New York Times criticized the lack of leadership from our President</a>.</p>
<p>It was particularly refreshing to read some of my everyday weblogs and see personal stories. Keith Lango, an animator from Dallas, broke from his usual animation topics to <a href="http://keithlango.blogspot.com/2005/09/who-is-my-neighbor.html">describe what his church was doing</a> to help evacuees.</p>
<p>Last week you could feel the frustration as people wanted to reach out but didn&#8217;t know how. Some of Traci&#8217;s family in southwestern Louisiana took their boats to New Orleans to help in the rescue effort, but were turned away, despite the call going out earlier for exactly that kind of help.</p>
<p>While leaders were still making promises of troops or doctors or buses two days into the aftermath, MoveOn.org had built a brand new web application for helping shelters and people now homeless to connect with others who are offering spare bedrooms: <a href="http://www.hurricanehousing.org/">HurricaneHousing.org</a>. It&#8217;s working.</p>
<p>We sent baby stuff to family in Louisiana, gave to the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/">Red Cross</a>, and then yesterday loaded up a bunch of clothes and bedding to take to the central drop-off location here in Austin. Driving down the highway today my eyes searched for the location. We needn&#8217;t have worried about missing it. There was a huge line of cars entering to donate, with several police cars and many volunteers directing traffic. Just about every level of the several-story parking garage was loaded with items &#8212; bags of clothing, beds, and baby toys stacked high and stretching across the whole area of the garage. It was being sorted pretty well, and it was heart-warming to see that it wasn&#8217;t just going to sit there for weeks &#8212; some of the most important items, like diapers, bottled water, and suitcases, were already piled up on slats and wrapped up, ready to be picked up by trucks and taken to shelters. A daunting task was slowly being whittled away and you could feel that efforts were paying off.</p>
<p>This disaster will likely rival the World Trade Center in terms of lives lost and damage done. And yet television stations didn&#8217;t suspend normal coverage as they did on September 11, nor did advertisers pull ads (unbelievably, we saw several for cruise ships and gas generators). I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a conspiracy, just that the shock took a couple of days to build up rather than the immediacy of an airplane crash. And I&#8217;m glad photographers and television crews got in, since this was very hard to visualize otherwise.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s going to be a lot of blame thrown around in the coming weeks and months. Some of it justified and some just politics. Personally, I see this as a national security failure. Just a week after the storm hit, protests are already being organized. People are angry.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to end on an uplifting note, with some message of hope and perseverance, but really, that seems a little naive. Still, great work is being done, and it&#8217;s inspiring to see it.</p>

			<p>There is a place for text, and a place for sound. If you are like me, you read and write text all day. Whether it&rsquo;s email, chat, html, code. For those times, music is all the sound you can take &mdash; it fits your mood and fades into the background. You don&rsquo;t want to necessarily listen to someone speaking &mdash; it&rsquo;s hard to concentrate on reading text and listening to someone else read text at the same time, and most people can read faster than they can listen anyway.</p>
<p>But for the times when we are away from our desk, sound can play a different role. Taking a walk or in the car your mind is free to either wander, or pay attention. I believe podcasts are for those times.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will post my first podcast. If it is well received (or even if it&rsquo;s not &mdash; this is blogging after all) I hope to create a podcast every few months. Because it will be so infrequent, there probably won&rsquo;t be a separate RSS feed for podcasts. The MP3 files will be included directly in the main feed for this weblog. Feedback of course is welcome at <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">manton@manton.org</a>. Thanks!</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I don&#8217;t consider myself a perfectionist. In fact, I can often be downright lazy. I write sloppy code sometimes. I am hasty with my artwork instead of thorough. I am always impatient to see the end result, regardless of what I am doing. (Oh, and my office is usually a mess.)</p>
<p>But when it comes to things that really matter, I have pretty high standards. When focused I can solve problems well and my attention to detail usually pays off. I am self-critical, which means I can improve.</p>
<p>I attended a Tufte talk earlier this year, and one thing that struck me was how dedicated he is to perfection. He phrases it in a different way, though, less assuming. &#8220;Do no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>When creating something &#8212; art, code, prose &#8212; there is an immediate personal attachment to that thing. Not only is it difficult to see mistakes in it, it seems almost impossible to throw it out and start again. But you have to. The trick is to see the investment in time not as wasted, but as a necessary first step in getting to the final place.</p>
<p>Write half the novel and then rip it apart, let go of the parts that you know aren&#8217;t working and try again. Refactor, redesign, redraw.</p>
<p>One of the revolutions at Disney in the 30s and 40s wasn&#8217;t just incredible talent, it was things like paying the extra money to film pencil tests, so that animators could see their work as it would appear on screen and fix mistakes instead of shipping it off blindly to the distributor. No one else was doing that because it didn&#8217;t seem to make business sense. That is, until you saw the improved results. (Software usability testing is a lot like that, too.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.animated-news.com/archives/00003772.html">recent interview with Animated News</a>, Andreas Deja talks about Walt and his high standards:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to inspired by Walt and what he did, and his standards. He just had these high standards, he would just give the audience something that they didn&#8217;t expect, that was beyond what they thought they would get, always aiming higher. And that&#8217;s one of his traits, that&#8217;s something to really shoot for, to go the extra mile, do even better than people would expect of you. I think it goes along with being a good artist, you&#8217;re never satisfied. It&#8217;s never good enough. That&#8217;s just the way it is. I think with that attitude you learn.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And with that, I&#8217;m off to create something instead of sleeping.</p>

			<p>One of our big projects at work just launched: the <a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/betterbooks/">VitalSource Store</a>. James Duncan Davidson and Mike Clark have posted about what it was like working on this project. My favorite posts include <a href="http://blog.x180.net/2005/07/rails_sandbox_d.html">this one about the Rails development sandbox</a>, and <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2005/07/12#ProduceConsumeXML">this one about RESTful web services</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irelan.net/becoming/past/2005/08/16/this-is-the-part-where-i-get-to-talk-about-my-job/">Ryan also chimed in</a> earlier this week about the project. It feels good to write about work in this space for me too, something I have rarely done but will likely do more as our company becomes well known.</p>
<p>Although the software is now freely available like iTunes, we&rsquo;ve all been hard at work on this stuff for a while now. In fact the current Mac and Windows clients started life over 4 years ago, and there is a bunch of shared code in there from our internal tools that is older still. We&rsquo;ve been shipping product to customers the whole time, but it feels good to now open things up to anyone.</p>
<p>If you look below the surface, there is a pretty incredible foundation that we can build good stuff on top of. Comments like <a href="http://www.anarchogeek.com/articles/2005/08/18/vitalsource-bookshelf-itunes-for-ebooks">this one from Anarchogeek</a> hit on exactly what we are trying to do:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s amazing to me is how the vital bookshelf is a slick mix of a web / desktop application. It uses html, javascript, and css, but it also uses native windows and interface elements. It&rsquo;s very nicely done.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

			<p>Friday night we saw Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station at <a href="http://www.thebackyard.net/">The Backyard</a>. At one time far outside Austin, suburbia has now claimed most of the land around this uniquely Austin venue. We parked outside what will shortly be a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, or maybe a Barnes &amp; Noble, or another of the too familiar cookie cutter retail shops that spring up around new neighborhoods. Walking over the dust, wire, and new concrete of the construction site, we were thankful for a chance to see a show at The Backyard before the landscape changes entirely, invaded by 24-hour parking lot lights and noisy cars.</p>
<p>Inside none of that could be seen or mattered, though, and the stars came out midway through the set on a clear sky above the open-air venue. Alison&#8217;s voice was beautiful and effortless. Songs from the O Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack, other great tracks like The Lucky One and Restless, and a bunch of incredible songs that were new to me. For the encore, her voice soared as if she hasn&#8217;t even really been trying before. The audience was moved and in the span of an hour I went from being a little familiar with a few songs, to a life-long fan.</p>
<p>Need some music? The <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewMix?id=40809933&amp;wm=1">Alison Krauss iTunes Essentials</a> is a good place to start.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I saw Howl&rsquo;s Moving Castle last night. When we showed up at the theater, I was surprised that they accidentally had the subtitled version, not the dub. It was great to see the original Japanese, and I look forward to comparing it to the English on subsequent viewings or when it hits DVD. The subtitles were very good &mdash; not the broken English you&rsquo;d expect from a cheap dub, so I expect the dialog is from the translation handled by Disney.</p>
<p>I should describe my first Hayao Miyazaki experience. I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about the history of animation, of a range of genres, styles, and studios, but my first exposure to Miyazaki actually came late, with the Disney dub of Kiki&rsquo;s Delivery Service. I knew there was something special about this film before I saw it, but finding a copy proved difficult due to lackluster marketing and poor distribution. I went to a few video stores in search of a rental before I finally found a VHS copy for sale and bought it.</p>
<p>Now, many of Miyazaki&rsquo;s earlier films are definitely geared more toward children, and this is especially true with Kiki. But I was completely blown away by the innocence and total sincerity in this film, and at the climax I was near tears. It is a masterpiece that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed watching over and over again now that I have my own children. Every second of film is there for a reason, with perfect pacing, dialogue, and emotion. From then I&rsquo;ve enjoyed his other films over the years, including a side trip while passing through Houston to see Princess Mononoke in the theater, since it was in very limited release, and of course Spirited Away, last year&rsquo;s <a href="../2003/10/porco_rosso.html">Porco Rosso premiere in Austin</a>, Totoro, and most of the rest.</p>
<p>So Howl&rsquo;s Moving Castle. I&rsquo;m not sure it was my favorite of his films, but it was very enjoyable, full of both originality and familiar Miyazaki themes. When it wants to be, the animation is beautiful, and the visuals stunning throughout. The acting of the lead character Sophie as a young and old woman is very believable, the movement and walk obviously well studied. Good work all around.</p>
<p>Watching a film like this, with at times such power and intensity, you&rsquo;d never believe that 2d animation has been written off by most decision-makers in this country. It&rsquo;s simply impossible to make a film like this in 3d, either now or 5 years from now, which means that the kinds of stories that can be told in U.S. feature animation are limited right now. As long as audiences are being entertained, few people will complain about this unnoticed drought, but the risk is that over time animation will be even more pigeon-holed than it already is.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Alright I gave in and bought a DS. The newly bundled Mario 64 was too much for me to resist. I justified it as an early father&#8217;s day present to myself.</p>
<p>It became increasingly obvious after E3 that Nintendo does not have a plan for a next-generation Game Boy, and instead they are putting most of their resources into the DS. The Game Boy Micro is a sweet little device, though.</p>
<p>What can I say about the DS after a few days use? It is at the same time flawed and brilliant. So much more bulky than the GBA SP, and a single screen alone is no bigger. The huge win is in the touch screen, which encourages innovative games that let you tinker, explore, or control your character in a new way. This system is just fun to use.</p>
<p>I picked up <a href="http://modojo.com/articles/reviews/ds/kirby_canvas_curse/">Kirby Canvas Curse</a> today and I&#8217;m loving it. As Nick from <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2005/06/14/impressions-kirby-canvas-curse/">4 color rebellion said</a>: &#8220;I here and now declare KCC the first true DS killer app. Combining elements of some of the best games of all time, Hal has created something totally fresh that sets the example of how to make a DS game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed. This looks like the first in a string of nice DS titles. Before now, I thought the PSP could actually do the impossible: beat Nintendo&#8217;s decade-long dominance of handhelds. But by the end of this year I think we will see quite a different story, with both DS and PSP clearly co-existing for some time to come.</p>
<p>And of course it comes down to the types of games that are being developed. The audience for Halo is not necessarily the same as for <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ds/strategy/nintendogschihuahuaandfriends/preview_6122817.html">Nintendogs</a>. But if you are trying to create for the hardcore and casual gamers, you need something from both on your platform.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,67854,00.html">Wired interview with Shigeru Miyamoto</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happening with video games is the same thing that happens with anything new and interesting. At the beginning, everybody wants to see what it is. They gather around and check it out. But gradually, people start to lose interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people who don&#8217;t lose interest become more and more involved. And the medium starts to be influenced by only those people. It becomes something exclusive to the people who&#8217;ve stuck with it for a long time. And when the people who were interested in it at first look back at it, it&#8217;s no longer the thing that interested them.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found this very insightful &#8212; just that a game company is thinking about these things at that level &#8212; and it brings into focus my own &#8220;return&#8221; to gaming.</p>

The first two from high school &#8212; Heather, at Magnolia Cafe in Austin before leaving, then Joel randomly on Market Street in San Francisco. I wondered who I&#8217;d run into next, and the answer came a few days into WWDC when I spotted Bob Pudell, who hired me for an internship at Apple my second semester at UT, and from which I can trace just about every job I&#8217;ve landed since.</p>

			<p>The .Mac SDK session here at WWDC was interesting. First, it was forward-looking, not something we&#8217;ve seen much this year with the exception of Intel. Also, it wasn&#8217;t covered under NDA (hence this blog post).</p>
<p>The 2.0 kit will be Tiger-only when it ships next month, but it will provide some really powerful features such as publish-and-subscribe and secondary user accounts that live off a paid .Mac account. Lots of fun applications surely to come. Apple wants to enable deep collaboration across applications.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it&#8217;s been a few days and many developers have already brought their apps up on Intel. The general consensus now seems to be that this will be a smooth and very fast transition. If there are new Intel-based PowerBooks ready in January, there will be a wide-variety of popular apps ready for it.</p>
<p>I use CodeWarrior for most projects, but I was still surprised to hear Apple say that almost half of Mac developers have also yet to switch to Xcode. That will be the biggest chore for most people.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the good times Metrowerks. CodeWarrior was a great development environment, and in its time PowerPlant was a great framework. The Mac OS X transition has always been a mix of steps forward and back, and Xcode will be no different.</p>

			<p>Even before I arrived in San Francisco, and even before the rumors surfaced of Apple switching to Intel, this WWDC looked to be a unique one. For the first time since I can remember, the conference was mostly going to cover a shipping OS. Steve Jobs mentioned Leopard only in that we would hear about it more next year.</p>
<p>On the BART from the airport I met some fellow WWDC attendees (the Apple and Mac-hack 1995 t-shirts were an easy giveaway). We discussed the ramifications of Intel, what else might be in store. I still hoped for a new product line, maybe a tablet or something interesting and different as the first step to Intel.</p>
<p>And then everything changed, the rumors were true. It was a bold move, but as Steve Jobs said, Apple is strong right now. They know what they have to do to pull this transition off.</p>
