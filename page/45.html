Founders <a href="http://www.damonclinkscales.com/">Damon</a>, Robert Rasmussen, and <a href="http://www.nonewmessages.com/">Rob Jones</a> have done a great job getting the group off the ground and lining up interesting topics.</p>
<p>Last night was our fourth meeting. <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/batate/">Bruce Tate</a> gave a talk on his experience ramping up a Rails team and comparisons to the Java world. As a new experiment on the agenda, afterwards some of us stuck around to hack together a member directory for the web site. I didn&#8217;t actively participate in the coding efforts, but I had a good time meeting new people. As usual, it was all followed by drinks at Hickory Street Bar &amp; Grill, where topics of discussion ranged from refactoring to Perl to C++ windowing toolkits to AppleGuide. You know there&#8217;s some real substance to Rails when it brings together such a diverse group.</p>
<p>Also just announced: the <a href="http://www.austinonrails.org/articles/2006/02/21/austin-on-rails-happy-hour-at-sxsw">Rails Happy Hour at SXSW</a>. Should be fun.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Everyone complains about software bloat. And it&rsquo;s easy to see why &mdash; applications are bigger and slower than they&rsquo;ve ever been, and users think the dozen features they will never use are to blame.</p>
<p>On the Mac we are lucky to have a large number of great, small, focused tools that solve a few problems well. The best of these become successful, but what then? You have to keep adding features. How do you control the software so that it becomes even more useful without feeling too packed?</p>
<p>One way is to differenciate between visible and hidden bloat. For example, Microsoft products used to have a tendency to take every major bullet point on the side of the box and make a toolbar icon for it. Even if the user only uses 5% of those features, they have easy access to far too many of them, and they needlessly have access to them all at once.</p>
<p><img src="../images/2006/keynote_sides.gif" border="0" height="147" width="215" alt="Keynote slider" align="right" /> Instead, adding features <i>in context</i> allows the application to grow without feeling too busy, and without distracting the user from the core set of features they are familiar with. The new user interface is discovered by using a new feature, and otherwise remains out of sight.</p>
<p>This point was really emphasized for me while using Keynote 3 the other day. I love the contextual floating slider when editing a shape (see image). They could have put this slider in the inspector window, but it is so infrequently used it would have remained disabled most of the time, and cluttered those panes with little benefit.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;ve been living in <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">Campfire</a> quite a bit over the last few days. It&rsquo;s a great app, well designed and very fast. But it suffers from a problem that iChat and other AIM clients do not have: it&rsquo;s easy to forget about a chat room while working on something else because there&rsquo;s no audio or visual notification that you missed a message.</p>
<p>I whipped up a tiny AppleScript that monitors the chat and beeps if there have been any changes. It&rsquo;s simple but it works fine for me, and should make do until someone writes a full WebKit-based Campfire client app with more options, or until 37signals releases a supported public web services API.</p>
<p>Requirements and how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requires Safari. Does not work with Firefox or Camino.</li>
<li>Campfire must be in its own web browser window, or the front tab in any window.</li>
<li>Every 2 seconds, it grabs the HTML from the &lt;div&gt; that Campfire uses for the chat messages. If it has changed since the last time, it beeps.</li>
<li>Only beeps if Safari is not the frontmost application.</li>
<li>If you are in multiple chat rooms, only works if they are in their own window and visible on screen.</ul>
<p>Download: <a href="../software/scripts/Campfire_Beep.dmg">Campfire_Beep.dmg</a> (90K)</p>
<p>Just open the application in Script Editor to edit it. Or view the <a href="../software/scripts/Campfire_Beep.html">full source</a>.</p>
<p>Comments? Email <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">manton@manton.org</a>. Enjoy!</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> I updated the script so that it doesn&#8217;t display errors, more correctly identifies URLs, and supports multiple open Campfire chat windows.</p>
<p><b>This just in:</b> 37signals added sound notification to Campfire today! So this little AppleScript is officially obsolete. I&#8217;d like to take credit for convincing them that such a feature was needed, but we all know how they love to build features that won&#8217;t roll-out until the 2nd week after launch. :-)</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-012406pixar_lat,0,67769.story?coll=la-home-headlines">It was made official today</a>. The rumor only surfaced a week ago, but in that time many people have gone from surprise and skepticism to hope that maybe it could be great for both companies. For Pixar, it might mean more creative control over their characters and sequels, plus not having to worry about distribution or settling for a partner without the reach into merchandising and vacation spots that Disney has. Interestingly, John Lasseter will also advise on new theme park attractions.</p>
<p>In the old days under Walt, it was common for artists to move between short films, features, and Disneyland design. Walt had a knack for seeing the best skills in people and using them wherever they could be most effective. He also had an instinct for story, a relentless pursuit of quality, and of what people would want to see, or how to sell it. Steve Jobs shares more than a few of these qualities, even if his management style at Pixar has been to delegate more than micromanage. Could Jobs pull another NeXT and infuse Disney with Pixar management and culture, or will he be content to sit on the board and coordinate deals with Apple for video content? Who knows.</p>
<p>For Disney, the benefits of the deal are pretty obvious, since all of the Pixar films have been huge money-makers. What&#8217;s less clear is what will happen to all the films currently in production at Disney. We have to assume they will continue mostly unchanged. Disney had a rough and controversial transition to 3d, with many layoffs and studio closures, but they did make the transition and this deal will probably upset that just a little.</p>
<p>There is also still that dream that with a leader (Lasseter) who appreciates traditional 2d animation, Disney might even buy back some of those old animation desks and give 2d another try. Although some of the great directors of the 2nd golden age at Disney have left (such as Ron Clements and John Musker of The Little Mermaid and Aladdin), Disney still has many 2d-trained directors, and now so does Pixar (Brad Bird), with enough 2d fans throughout both companies to form another studio branch entirely.</p>
<p>I read a bunch of weblogs by artists at Disney and Pixar now, so hopefully their views will start to trickle in too. Good luck to everyone at both studios.</p>

						<h1 class="entry-title">
				<a href="../2006/01/limitations_in_toys.html" rel="bookmark">Limitations in toys and software</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>One of the first things you notice when you have kids is how bad the toys are. Everything is electronic, makes too much noise, and is quickly discarded when the batteries run out or when everything you could possibly do with the toy is exhausted. The great toys are the ones that allow an infinite number of possibilities. Each game experience is different, whether it&#8217;s building something new with blocks, or play-acting a different story with dolls.</p>
<p>How do you tell the difference between a great toy and a bad one? If the toy is made to do a few specific amazing things, with a bunch of bullet points and exclamation marks on the side of the box, be weary of it. For example, modern LEGOs come in all sorts of pre-molded shapes. If you buy the pirate set, it will be great fun for the first few days until you realize that it can only be a pirate ship. But if you buy a bucket of LEGOs (yes, they still sell these), you can build a pirate ship one day and a barn the next. Even better, toys should interoperate with one another, something that feels forced if the types of toys are so specifically designed that they don&#8217;t fit well together.</p>
<p>This is especially true for younger children. Visiting the Waldorf School last year they used the example of a silk scarf. It can be a cloak, hat, river, cloud, hair, bed, rope, or the wind. A scarf seems so limited, but it&#8217;s the extreme simplicity that gives it life through a child&#8217;s creativity.</p>
<p><a href="http://keithlango.blogspot.com/2005/08/shining-thru-clouds.html">Keith Lango discusses limitations</a> in animating a scene: &#8220;The next time you have a scene and you&#8217;re told all the limitations that come with it find the thrill of making it work great anyhow. [&#8230;] Let the limitations be your friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one knew whether the original Star Wars (episode 4) would be a success or not. George Lucas used what cheats he could to make the special effects work, forcing himself to be creative within the confines of the budget and limitations of technology at the time. Instead the focus was on the characters and on the story. Twenty years later, with the huge budget of the prequel films, one could argue that he was so distracted with what he <i>could</i> do that the important lessons of what made the first film a success were forgotten.</p>
<p>37signals talks about <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/less_as_a_competitive_advantage_my_10_minutes_at_web_20.php">constraints and doing more with less</a>. I agree with that, but there&#8217;s something else. Some of the greatest software out there is designed in such a way that it can be used for purposes that the designers and programmers did not intend. The software introduces simple concepts that can be stacked and rearranged not unlike those LEGOs. There may be an implied workflow but it is not enforced. Instead maybe the interface flows around documents, which can be named anything and stored in any structure. Or maybe there is an editer that was written for one general purpose but which is simple enough that it also allows editing of other formats.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been pushing for what they call an inductive user experience. It is task-based, context-specific interfaces that attempt to remove the bloated menu and toolbar clutter that the Office apps are known for. The latest phase of this is the Office 12 user interface, which introduces ribbon controls. Microsoft has been going down this path for years though, trying to expose features to the user that would otherwise be lost and buried. They are learning from what works about the discoverability of web applications.</p>
<p>But you want to be careful to not force a certain workflow on the user in these cases, because by doing so the abstract usefulness of the software could be crippled. You don&#8217;t want to go too modal or too restrictive. That&#8217;s one of the reasons wizard-like interfaces were annoying. It&#8217;s not just the idiot-proofing that bugs people, it&#8217;s that there may be some truly useful features hidden behind those &#8220;easy to use&#8221; screens, waiting for a UI to come along and let users use the features on their own terms.</p>
<p>On the other hand, GarageBand is a good example of a focused app (create or record music) that also had broader uses (edit and mix any audio file), which allowed Apple to go one step further and embrace what the rest of us without guitars and keyboards were using it for (podcasts). Basecamp is another flexible app that works because 37signals made the conscious decision to make communication the center of project management, above timelines and charts. Flickr, Odeo, 43 Things, and other so-called Web 2.0 apps will be successful not because of a string of buzzwords, but because they take a very simple concept (&#8220;upload photos&#8221;, &#8220;write goals&#8221;), mix in some communication and sharing, and build it in a way that encourages many different uses.</p>
<p>Most software is just like poorly designed children&#8217;s toys. It might solve one problem well for a time, but it is eventually discarded when it fails to evolve with the user&#8217;s needs. Simple software that solves broad problems can be used for a variety of tasks, and is small enough that it can continue to be improved or integrated well with other applications.</p>

It is without question the fastest web app I use. Because the application is so focused, even full page reloads are faster in Ta-da than AJAX requests in some other web apps.</p>
<p>These are seemingly simple things, but they add up to an app that rivals any native (Mac or Windows) to-do list software. It makes me wonder how great a native app could be if someone put the same thought into user interface and simple workflow that Ta-da has. The advantage so-called Web 2.0 apps have over native apps is that they are inherently client/server based, but a native application could embrace the network in the same way and (maybe) provide a superior user experience. I&rsquo;ve yet to see any apps that do this effectively, but it will have to happen if the desktop hopes to stay relevant for anything except tasks that benefit from large local storage (e.g. Photoshop and Final Cut Pro).</p>
<p>I use Ta-da List for everything now. Here&rsquo;s a sample of recent lists:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0">
<tr>

			<p>Tonight ABC aired the original Charlie Brown Christmas special yet again. That thing never gets old. The animation is limited and the characters always off model from one scene to the next, but it has great voices and characters and heart.</p>
<p>This seems a perfect opportunity to link to Bring Me the Head of Charlie Brown, a hilarious CalArts student film that I first saw <a href="http://jrhull.typepad.com/seward_street/2005/04/bring_me_the_he.html">linked from Jim Hull&#8217;s excellent blog</a>, Steward Street. Every person who has hosted the movie has been shutdown by their web host due to bandwidth usage. Luckily <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2668909">it&#8217;s now up on ifilm.com</a>. The short is made even more amusing if you contrast it with the animation style of the original Charlie Brown specials: the CalArts film has much fuller animation and better lip-sync. Even so, I wouldn&#8217;t want anything about Charlie Brown Christmas changed.</p>

			<p>Okay, I admit it. I&#8217;ve been watching The Apprentice this year. I hate being addicted to it. It&#8217;s not even entertaining for me because it&#8217;s so stressful just to watch. I&#8217;m probably more nervous sitting on my couch then they are in the boardroom.</p>
<p>(Spoiler warning for those of you who do not watch live television.)</p>
<p>Traci predicted he would hire both of them, and I was leaning toward a Rebecca pick, but either choice would be fine. Then Trump totally sets it up to hire both of them with the two potential jobs, until Randal slaps Rebecca in the face with the &#8220;There can only be one Apprentice&#8221; line. Unbelievable. I&#8217;m still obsessing over how wrong that was.</p>

			<p>We&rsquo;ve heard it countless times: Before you spend any time optimizing, profile your code. And yet we always think we know where the performance problems are without testing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I started some extra work to help a company port their Windows software to the Mac. It turned into a large project, and when the app ships I will write more about it here. But for now let&rsquo;s just say that it involves a lot of Windows bitmaps.</p>
<p>Performance had been a problem almost from the start. It is a very drawing-intensive application, and I spent time optimizing the path to Quartz. Eventually everything goes through a CGImage, but there is some overhead getting there. I knew more could be done.</p>
<p>Eventually I bothered to run Shark on it. Within 30 seconds it revealed that almost 50% of the application time was being spent inside CGContextSelectFont, which was called very frequently for the very basic text drawing that was needed. I had not even suspected that code. I rewrote it to use ATSUI and all the performance problems immediately melted away. And it wasn&rsquo;t even optimized ATSUI &#8212; just brain-dead create a text layout, font size, and draw.</p>
<p>It was not obvious to me that CGContextSelectFont would be so slow, so I&rsquo;m posting this one for Google to pick up. Happy coding!</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.damonclinkscales.com/">Damon</a> and I have been discussing how time constraints can encourage creativity. I hinted at this in <a href="../2005/11/10302_words.html">my first NaNoWriMo post</a>, and it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been trying on other projects at work. Of course the concept is all through <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/constraints_breed_breakthrough_creativity.php">what 37signals is doing</a>.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago there was a web application I wanted to write. I estimated it would take a couple of weeks to knock in the basic functionality. A small project, but big enough that it would have to be juggled with other priorities. And the requirements would need to be discussed with other members of the team, which might mean a quick death at the hands of committee-led design.</p>
<p>Encouraged by <a href="http://del.icio.us/willie">Willie</a> over that weekend, we said let&#8217;s just do it and see what happens. Monday morning I asked myself: could I implement most of the application&#8230; <i>before lunch?</i> Because if I couldn&#8217;t, the project would still probably be sitting at zero lines of code. Luckily the app was a simple discussion system, and Rails was a particularly good fit for it.</p>
<p>In the latest The Writing Show podcast, <a href="http://www.wynia.org/wordpress/2005/12/06/the-writing-show-interviews-me-podcast/">J Wynia</a> talks about why NaNoWriMo works. He said the biggest problem writers are faced with is the blank page. NaNoWriMo forces you to start writing immediately, because otherwise you won&#8217;t have a chance of finishing 50,000 words in a month. And something magic happens when you&#8217;ve written the first sentence: before you know it stories and characters are flowing and you&#8217;ve got a half dozen pages or more. If you waited until the first page of the novel had been fully thought out in your mind, you&#8217;d still be looking at a blank page.</p>
<p><a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/creativity_on_s.html">Kathy Sierra wrote about creativity on speed</a>, but I take issue with part of her post. I see speed in development work (C++, Ruby, whatever) as a good thing when it forces you to do something you would not otherwise be able to do because the task was too daunting. But speed in art is something else entirely. The latter is the whole subject of Betty Edwards&#8217; classic book Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain. The idea is that by working quickly (gesture drawing, for example), you draw on instinct and what you are seeing, and less on what you think you know about how something looks.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to this concept in animation through the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?tag=mantonorg&amp;keyword=Shamus+Culhane&amp;mode=books">books of Shamus Culhane</a>. It resonated with me immediately not just because I knew it was true &#8212; it matched my own experience with life drawing &#8212; but because he first discovered this while working on an old 1930s Mickey and Pluto short (Hawaiian Holiday) that I remember fondly as a kid (I still have the VHS copy). In some ways the high-speed drawing technique works even better in animation because you are already talking about time. The faster you work the closer the process itself resembles the final product on screen.</p>
<p>While building software is definitely an art &#8212; especially the process of crafting the user interface, or just bootstrapping an idea from nothing through brainstorming &#8212; I don&#8217;t think programming benefits from speed in the same way that art does. With software development the main benefit you get from working fast is breaking through roadblocks, simplifying, and getting things done. The creativity is a result of forcing yourself to think of things in a new way.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>So a couple of months ago a 1-year-old who shall remain nameless tossed my cell phone into the toilet. I thought surely I would have to buy a new phone, but after taking it all apart, cleaning it, and letting it dry in the sun &#8212; good as new. (Except for the screen. Wow, that thing has seen better days.)</p>
<p>Then, a few weeks later, the phone disappeared altogether. Again, I&#8217;d probably have to drop some $$$ and buy a new one. But you know what? I stopped looking for it. I could borrow Traci&#8217;s if I really needed one, I haven&#8217;t been traveling recently, and there is something strangely liberating about going to the store or whatnot and being impossible to contact. (Except for pigeons. They will always work in a pinch.)</p>
<p>The phone turned up yesterday. I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about that yet.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.irelan.net/becoming/past/2005/08/29/it-really-doesnt-take-much-money-or-time-to-set-up-a-decent-podcasting-studio-i-did-it/">Ryan described his hardware setup</a> for podcasting a while back. With at least a few dozen podcasts under his belt, he&rsquo;s got his system down.</p>
<p>I wanted to write a little about the process I used to create the <a href="../2005/08/trains_podcast.html">Trains podcast</a>. Not because I think it will be particularly helpful to newcomers, but just because I think it&rsquo;s interesting. (Actually, I&rsquo;m just now getting around to posting this. Months have past since I wrote it, and now Ryan spends his time writing about why none of this matters, and he&rsquo;s right: tools should be <a href="http://podcastfreeamerica.com/past/the-real-beginners-guide-to-podcasting/">accessible to non-technical beginners</a>.)</p>
<p>I started by borrowing a good mic from a friend. Eventually he will want it back, but luckily for me he&rsquo;s a great musician and has a bunch of microphones that he uses regularly. It&rsquo;s from audio-technica.</p>
<p>I had a few choices for recording audio. I own a Griffin iMic, but decided not to record directly into the computer this time, so it went unused. Some of the recordings I planned to do would be away from a computer, so I needed something mobile.</p>
<p>A great choice for this might have been a Rio, or a MiniDisc. I was a MiniDisc fan back during the first-generation of the devices, but sold it years ago. And I&rsquo;m a happy iPod owner, so buying yet another MP3 player didn&rsquo;t make sense. My concern is that the moment I do that, Apple will release a software update to uncripple the voice recording in the iPod.</p>
<p>For the train conductor recording near the beginning of the podcast, I used a Griffin iTalk connected to an iPod. This is all the electronics I took with me on the train to Chicago. I ended up recording a lot with it, without an external mic at all, but not much of the audio was really usable.</p>
<p>The opening train sounds I recorded just a short distance from my house. I biked down to the crossing with my nice microphone and recorded directly into a digital video camera, on to MiniDV tape. This turned out to work so well that I recorded all my voice this way.</p>
<p>Since it was DV, I used iMovie to import clips of all the voice work. I could have exported to AIFF from there (and did try to), but because I was sampling lots of other material, I decided to be consistent and use <a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/audiohijack/">Audio Hijack</a> to grab the audio directly as it played from iMovie. I also used Audio Hijack to rip from a RealAudio source, iTunes music, and from DVD Player.</p>
<p>Once I had all the AIFF files, I simply dragged them onto the timeline in GarageBand to create new tracks. I had planned to use Audacity, but it turns out GarageBand does everything I needed. I was raised on SoundEdit Pro, and the clunkiness of Audacity by comparison is hard to deal with. Controlling the fade in and out of audio for different clips was super easy in Garage Band.</p>
<p><center><img src="../images/2005/garageband.gif" border="0" height="253" width="450" alt="garageband.gif" /></center></p>
<p>And then I exported to iTunes, converted to MP3, and posted to the site. Power to the people!</p>

			<p>The U2 concert in Houston a few weeks ago was great. I drove back late at night, with <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewArtist?id=6483093">The Killers album</a> on repeat to keep me awake. In the era of single-click pop song purchases on iTunes, it&#8217;s not often that I buy a full album. Then again, it&#8217;s not often that a band releases an album that has 10 good songs on it.</p>
<p>The other day I found an old Converse shoe box taped closed, hidden behind some old VHS tapes. Opening it revealed a bunch of CDs I hadn&#8217;t listened to in many, many (many) years. Arrested Development, Pearl Jam, Gals Panic, Rollins Band, The Nixons, Temple of the Dog, Van Halen, Primus, New Order. It&#8217;s fun to think back on what I was doing, how a given song might have effected my mood or my life so long ago. It&#8217;s a lot like video game music: usually catchy, and maybe more importantly, listened to over and over again. I&#8217;m still trying to get a podcast out about that, hopefully before the end of the year.</p>

			<p><img src="../images/2005/nano_2005.gif" border="0" height="99" width="99" alt="Winner" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5" /> As I <a href="../2005/11/10302_words.html">posted about a few weeks ago</a>, I decided to write a novel this month (National Novel Writing Month, or <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.com/">NaNoWriMo</a>). I posted some of my progress on <a href="http://www.43things.com/person/manton">43 Things</a>, and I&rsquo;m going to repost those entries here.</p>
<p>Actually using 43 Things more fully, I am even more impressed. They have done an amazing job of allowing communities to form around goals. The site looks simple on the surface but there is depth to it. There is something about random encouragement from total strangers that works.</p>
<p>Another useful resource was the <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/modules/newbb/">NaNoWriMo forums</a>. I never posted there but people were always quick to help others and offer advice. They also organized many local gatherings at coffee shops or bookstores, so I went one night and met a couple other Austin writers. NaNoWriMo works not just because of the intense deadline, but because of the shared goal as thousands of people are doing the same thing. That&rsquo;s why 43 Things was such a good fit.</p>
<p>Here are the entries.</p>
<p><i>12,002 words (Nov 9th):</i></p>
<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m still behind, but I feel good about my progress because I started a few days late. The last chapter I just finished was one of the first to really work, which seems to be a good sign that I&rsquo;ve found some kind of rhythm to get through the next few weeks. Either that or the plot is building up to something too soon and I&rsquo;m about to run out of ideas. :-)</p></blockquote>
<p><i>25,043 words (Nov 20th):</i></p>
<blockquote><p>I only just now crossed the halfway point. I thought I was on my way to catching up, but there were several days last week where I didn&rsquo;t write at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still determined to finish, but it&rsquo;s going to take some serious writing over the Thanksgiving weekend.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>34,797 words (Nov 28th):</i></p>
<blockquote><p>I didn&rsquo;t write enough over Thanksgiving. I left the PowerBook at home and filled up spiral notebooks instead. Even without an accurate word count I knew I had fallen short of my goal. Last night I typed it all up until my wrists burned.</p>
<p>I will finish but it is going to take a lot: 5000 words a day for the next three days. Until now my top daily word count has been about 3000, and the average somewhat less than that.</p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone else who passed 50,000 over the weekend!</p></blockquote>
<p><i>44,054 words (Nov 29th):</i></p>
<blockquote><p>Looks like I will finish. I made a big push last night and wrote about 6000 words. Less tonight, but I still think I am on track to finish tomorrow. The story should wrap up right at 50,000.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>50,136 words (Nov 30th):</i></p>
<blockquote><p>Yay! I finished.</p>
<p>I spontaneously started this endeavor a few days into the month and I&rsquo;m still a little amazed that I stuck with it. It&rsquo;s a great feeling though, especially as I was nearing the end and the plot was wrapping up. Sure, the story has some problems, and it could have benefited from some research. But actually I&rsquo;m quite happy with the overall flow of the story and some of the characters. There are some good scenes in there that I&rsquo;m proud of.</p></blockquote>

			<p>So I finished rereading Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire in anticipation of the 4th film, which we just saw last night. (Thanks <a href="http://www.damonclinkscales.com/">Damon</a> for remembering to buy tickets a month early.) The film did a great job of capturing the important points of the book, while pushing the plot along at a very quick pace. The first half dozen chapters seemed to slip by in only five minutes of screen time. I was wondering how they were going to squeeze 800 pages into two and a half hours, but they did it.</p>
<p>Overhead while Traci was reading the book: &#8220;It&#8217;s weird&#8230; Hermione seems so much more like a Hufflepuff.&#8221;</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s all about the games. I picked up Mario Kart DS yesterday and it doesn&#8217;t disappoint. The Nintendo WiFi network was a little flaky last night, but things are running smoothly today. And it&#8217;s been fun to watch friend codes start showing up in my news reader, from blog sites that would otherwise restrict their postings to non-game topics.</p>

			<p>A few weeks ago I heard about <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>, a month-long &#8220;contest&#8221; to write a novel. You start November 1st, end at midnight November 30th, and if you&#8217;ve amassed 50,000 words, you win. Of course there are a lot of winners, and no prizes, but it&#8217;s a great idea and I think really helps push people in ways they didn&#8217;t think possible.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t planning on entering, even though I&#8217;ve tinkered with trying to write a novel before now. It&#8217;s hard work, and it&#8217;s easy to get stuck up on plot problems or run out of ideas and abandon the whole thing. That&#8217;s the last thing I have time for. I brought up NaNoWriMo in discussion a few days ago and I talked about it as something that other people were doing, not something I was crazy enough to try.</p>
<p>But three days into the month, I added it to <a href="http://www.43things.com/person/manton">my 43things</a> and started writing. I&#8217;m way behind the recommended quota already, but I&#8217;ve just crossed the 10,000 word mark so I wanted to mark the milestone.</p>
<p>Most of the novels, especially mine, won&#8217;t be very good. They have plot problems, weak characters, and half of them are made up as they go along. I&#8217;m 8 chapters into it and only have a vague idea of what will happen from one chapter to the next. I did absolutely no planning upfront.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s like a marathon. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you look good when you cross the finish line.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about <i>setting unreasonable deadlines</i>. They force you to stop procrastinating and work your heart out to finish something.</p>

			<p>Steve Jobs in yesterday&#8217;s special event, discussing the white iPods:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a huge success for us, and therefore it&#8217;s time to replace it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The new iPods look great. At first I was disappointed by the $1.99 price for music videos and TV shows, but when you do the math it is only a little more than buying DVDs. And what about the small quality, only 320&#215;240? In the name of science I dropped $2 to test it.</p>
<p>Last week, thanks to eBay, I became the proud owner of 2 tickets to see U2 in Houston at the end of the month. I&#8217;ve seen every U2 tour since ZooTV over a decade ago, so I wasn&#8217;t about to let little things like &#8220;too busy&#8221; and &#8220;money&#8221; stand in the way this time. Our seats are fairly horrible, but the price was right and all that matters is that we are there.</p>
<p>So buying a U2 music video was a natural choice. The download time was reasonable. I clicked it to full-screen on my Cinema Display and sat down 6 feet away. It actually looked good. 30 frames per second doesn&#8217;t hurt either. I could definitely watch TV shows this way.</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit from the Apple event. Disney&#8217;s new CEO Bob Iger was introduced quite warmly by Steve Jobs, and Iger even joked that he still hoped an agreement could be reached between Disney and Pixar for continuing distribution of their films. Sounds like that could happen after all.</p>

To prepare I dusted off my old Laserdisc with the three original Wallace and Gromit short films, but the feature equals and surpasses those films in every way. Thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
<p>Aardman Animations fans should also seek out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0810919966/mantonorg">Creating 3d Animation</a>, a combination behind-the-scenes and how-to book out a few years ago with great stuff on model construction and movement. In the age of computer animation it takes some passion to break the mold and work hand-drawn, but even more rare is the artist who wants to follow in Nick Park&#8217;s footsteps. It&#8217;s great to see the art-form of stop-motion come alive again to hopefully inspire a new set of filmmakers.</p>
<p>Speaking of old school, just today I saw that <a href="http://mad-t-party.blogspot.com/">Hans Bacher has a weblog</a>. I&#8217;ll never forget seeing his art from the Mulan book years ago. The man is a master at composition and effortless landscapes.</p>
<p>And like a lot of animators new to blogging, he uses Blogger. If you look at my NetNewsWire subscriptions (right), you&#8217;ll see an interesting trend of Blogger and LiveJournal icons. I&#8217;m not sure what that means, if anything.</p>
