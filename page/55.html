			<p>You may not notice it right away, but Tweet Marker Plus is the start of a big migration for my Twitter projects. The backend infrastructure for <a href="http://tweetlibrary.com/">tweetlibrary.com</a> will be moving there, so that Tweet Marker can have access to published collections. And a major web feature to complement Tweet Library ‚Äî originally written for tweetlibrary.com last year but never released ‚Äî will be launching on Tweet Marker Plus instead.</p>
<p>Essentially, Tweet Marker will be the web app and web services. Tweet Library will be the native iOS client only.</p>
<p>This has a few pretty big advantages for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>One web app to manage instead of two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other Twitter apps can access the collections publishing API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tweet Marker is a better brand than Tweet Library.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More people know about Tweet Marker. It just makes sense to build any new web features on top of that existing name.</p>
<p>The first step in this transition is ready now: published collections can be accessed via tweetmarker.net. For example, see <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/collections/shauninman/millinaut">this collection of tweets from the game Millinaut</a> by Shaun Inman, Neven Mrgan, and Alex Ogle.</p>

			<p><a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">VoodooPad 5</a> is out this weekend, with a new file format that plays nicely with Dropbox. <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/blog/archives/2012/04/voodoopad_5.0_released.html">Gus Mueller says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  ‚ÄúNo more connecting to WebDAV servers and having to deal with authentication issues and strange HTTP errors. Now you can just put your VoodooPad 5 document in a Dropbox folder and VP will detect when pages have been updated.‚Äù
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is another good example of where web APIs like Dropbox can be <a href="../2012/04/icloud_vs_the_web.html">more useful than iCloud</a>. Multiple people can collaborate on a VoodooPad document, and the direct download and Mac App Store copies of VoodooPad can sync together.</p>
<p>Also new in version 5 is native support for Markdown and an ePub export option. <a href="../2007/01/falling_in_love.html">The workflow for help documentation</a> that I posted <em>5 years ago</em> carries over to VoodooPad 5 just fine, too.</p>

			<p>There has been some good commentary on <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/15/web-freedom-threat-google-brin">Sergey Brin&#8217;s interview</a> with the Guardian. It&#8217;s probably best summarized in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/15/google-open-web">John Gruber&#8217;s comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The assumption here is that the only way to search is through Google, and that the &#8216;open Internet&#8217; is only what Google can index and sell ads against.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This resonates with me because I think Google has put enough ads on the internet. It&#8217;s impossible to take anything Google says at face value if they talk of &#8220;open&#8221; but their intentions say &#8220;ads&#8221;. But here&#8217;s the thing: Brin is actually right. There <em>is</em> great data hidden behind apps that should be indexable.</p>
<p>In the race to win the App Store, we forgot about the web. Think about Instagram. Millions of photos are being shared that are inaccessible via a search engine. These photos can&#8217;t be found again and aren&#8217;t discoverable. When you search the web, how does it make sense that public photos on Flickr show up, but public photos on Instagram do not?</p>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t have to choose between Apple&#8217;s closed systems and Google&#8217;s ad-driven business. I want to talk about improving the web without automatically being pro-Google. <a href="https://twitter.com/iconmaster/status/191901693527605248">This tweet from John Marstall</a> made me realize it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I&#8217;d prefer to separate &#8216;indexable&#8217; from &#8216;indexable by Google.&#8217; Yes, they&#8217;re mostly the same for now. Might not always be.&#8221;.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We need competition in web search. More than Bing. A new search engine is the number 1 item from [Paul Graham&#8217;s frighteningly ambitious ideas](http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html(:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The best ideas are just on the right side of impossible. I don&#8217;t know if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be. Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and recently I&#8217;ve noticed some cracks in their fortress.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s crazy, but so was the 1st search breakthrough, lightning-fast AltaVista, and so was the 2nd major innovation, Google itself. It&#8217;s time for a search engine that isn&#8217;t all about ads. It&#8217;s time for search that understands apps and embraces data from web services as much as it does from web sites. It&#8217;s time for the 3rd act in search.</p>

			<p>&#8220;This MacStories article&#8221;:http://www.macstories.net/stories/iclouds-first-six-months-the-developers-weigh-in/ covers the progress that developers have made adopting iCloud over the last 6 months. Over the next 6 months, we should have an even better appreciation for what iCloud is and isn&#8217;t good for.</p>
<p>For iOS backups and iTunes Match, iCloud is fantastic. For private, app-specific data that doesn&#8217;t make any sense away from a single developer&#8217;s native Mac and iOS apps, it&#8217;s also excellent. There&#8217;s no question that using Macs, iPhones, and iPads today is a significantly better experience thanks to iCloud.</p>
<p>But there are two fundamental limitations in iCloud that make it inappropriate for a bunch of syncing uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>No way to access it from other platforms or web apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No way to share data between apps from different developers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect Apple to change this. Again, for what iCloud was made for, these limitations are fine. It simply means that iCloud cannot replace web APIs that <em>do</em> solve these two problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s what I wrote&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/06/faq_for_tweet_marker.html not long after announcing the Tweet Marker API:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The primary goal with Tweet Marker is to enable different Twitter apps to work together. iCloud is designed for storage and syncing only between apps from the same developer, so it&#8217;s not appropriate as a replacement architecture for Tweet Marker.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Think back to the so-called Web 2.0, which gave us web services to access previously closed-off data. This eventually led to truly dominant syncing APIs like Dropbox, Simplenote, and Instapaper. At the same time, we all have more devices than ever before. Syncing exploded on iOS in text editors and note taking apps. Without a proper shared file system between apps, or even an event or scripting system, these iOS apps looked to web APIs as the only way to communicate.</p>
<p>That has turned out wonderfully. With web APIs as the only solution, we see more compatibility between apps and more web services popping up all the time. If you create a new web app, it&#8217;s dead without an API. Every success of the modern web, from Flickr to Twitter, has an API that is available from any platform.</p>
<p>So then what about iCloud? If Web 2.0 made data more accessible, iCloud takes that same data and&#8230; keeps it closed. It&#8217;s a step forward on user convenience and a step back on interoperability.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a developer considering iCloud support, just make sure your data fits there. Ask yourself if your data is all about your app, or <em>if it&#8217;s bigger than your app</em>. Developers who are willing to take a risk on building an open API instead of iCloud could see new opportunities: web-based views of their data, compatibility with other apps, and syncing on the Mac outside of the App Store.</p>
<p>A couple years ago, &#8220;Shawn Blanc said about cloud syncing&#8221;:http://shawnblanc.net/2010/08/sans-cloud/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And my next wish? A cloud-based service like Instapaper, but for to-do items. I want it to be available in apps like Tweetie, Reeder, and more, so when I click on &#8216;Do Later&#8217; it sends the link or item of note into a running to-do list (that syncs with Things, of course).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine if Things or OmniFocus or another tasks app opened up a slice of their private syncing API to make the Instapaper of to-do inboxes. Now take other APIs for all of the useful apps we use. Not just to-do apps as Shawn mentions, but RSS, photos, blog drafts, sketches, and more.</p>
<p>What I wrote above about Tweet Marker is still very much true. Since then, Tweet Marker has become the standard for last-read syncing between Twitter apps, with support for 15 apps and many more in development. I want to see more syncing platforms like this. Let&#8217;s think big and make apps work together.</p>

			<p>When I created &#8220;Tweet Marker Plus&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/plus, I thought I was creating a new way to search Twitter. Limit the search to just people you follow and you can store more tweets, and more relevant ones. But as I&#8217;ve been adding new features to it, I&#8217;m realizing that Tweet Marker Plus is really a new kind of Twitter client &mdash; a client that has search and filters at its core.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the sidebar looks like in my Tweet Marker Plus account:</p>
<p><img src="../images/2012/saved_filters.png" alt="saved filters" border="0" width="267" height="332" /></p>
<p>Seems simple enough. But quickly switching between saved filters is very powerful. Because Tweet Marker is routinely fetching new tweets in the background, even when you haven&#8217;t opened your web browser in days or weeks, <em>there are no gaps in the timeline</em>. When I use a filter, it&#8217;s showing me everything that any of the people I follow have said since I first started using Tweet Marker Plus.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited about this. I&#8217;ll keep adding features and growing the storage, to make Tweet Marker Plus the best value $2/month could possibly get you.</p>

			<p>I love reading about how big sites use Amazon EC2. If &#8220;this post from Instagram&#8221;:http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of is still accurate, they must be at something like $50k/month in hosting costs. Their user base has doubled in the 4 months since they posted that.</p>
<p>My setup for Tweet Marker is trivial by comparison, but to me &mdash; without Instagram&#8217;s $7 million in funding &mdash; it&#8217;s a very big deal. What I wrote &#8220;back in October&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/10/redisonly_migration.html about moving to Redis is still mostly true, although I&#8217;ve added MySQL and Sphinx to the mix. I now run with 3 Amazon EC2 &#8220;medium&#8221; instances and have 5 web dynos (with 3 Unicorn processes each) at Heroku.</p>
<p>I put everything from donations back into the servers. For Tweet Marker to work, it had to be rock solid. It had to scale. It&#8217;s only the first week for &#8220;Tweet Marker Plus&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/plus subscriptions, but already I have a good feeling that it&#8217;ll all pay off.</p>

			<p>Tweet Marker is going really well. It&#8217;s growing fast, users love it, and it has wide support in all of my favorite Twitter apps.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m announcing the next step for the service: Tweet Marker Plus. This is a paid subscription with additional features, such as a brand new search and a web-based timeline that syncs with Tweet Marker. Along with Plus, I&#8217;m rolling out version 2 of the API.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve learned a lot over the last few months. Here are some of the things that I wanted to improve for the next version of Tweet Marker, both for the API and the business.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Consistent behavior across clients.</em> It was fine at first for everyone to experiment with their own way to use the API, but now it&#8217;s time to come up with some best practices to guide developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>More frequent sync.</em> Mac and iPad clients in particular &mdash; where the app may stay in the front for some time &mdash; need to be hitting the server at regular intervals to catch changes from other devices. I believe this is the most common source of problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>JSON-based API.</em> The &#8220;v2&#8221; API should use JSON and carry more metadata, such as timestamps for the tweets and when it synced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Profitable hosting.</em> Although I&#8217;ve accepted donations since nearly the beginning, hosting costs are way up. I didn&#8217;t originally intend to turn this into its own business, but that is the clear way forward. It needs to bring in consistent revenue to cover hosting now and into the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With paid subscriptions, I can tackle the above bullets and also add more features. The first new feature to launch as part of Plus is a new search. Tweet Marker Plus indexes tweets from your friends so that you can find tweets later. It&#8217;s the solution to use when you don&#8217;t want to search all of Twitter, but you also want a large collection of tweets, not just the most recent ones that many clients store and filter.</p>
<p>Tweet Marker Plus is $2/month. You can sign up today at &#8220;tweetmarker.net/plus&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/plus. Also check out &#8220;the screencast&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetmarker/.</p>
<p>The API documentation has moved to Github and is &#8220;also available now&#8221;:https://github.com/manton/tweetmarker/.</p>

			<p>Every year on March 9th, as SXSW is getting started, I like to mark the anniversary of this blog. This time it&#8217;s the 10th year.</p>
<p>&#8220;My second post back in 2002&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2002/03/ernest_kim_and_jason.html was about a panel run by 37signals. I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ernest and Jason really get it &#8212; I hope they inspire some designers to think about web sites in a new way, and finally start focusing on usability and page load time and cut the fancy graphics, roll-overs, and animations.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This was a couple years before they reinvented themselves as a software company with Basecamp. As the &#8220;new Basecamp launches this week&#8221;:http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3129-launch-the-all-new-basecamp, it&#8217;s fascinating to think back on how far 37signals has come. The web is bigger now and more complex. Subscription web apps are everywhere. But I think the focus on performance that drove Jason Fried and his original co-founders to promote simple design in that SXSW panel a decade ago is still very much at the heart of what 37signals does.</p>

			<p>The day after I &#8220;wrote about removing Clipstart from the Mac App Store&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html, Apple announced that the sandboxing requirement would be delayed again. In that announcement was also a new twist: sandboxing would not be required for bug fix updates to existing apps.</p>
<p>This is welcome news, but I stand by my post. I still plan to transition Clipstart away from the MAS. The difference now is that I can do it at my own pace, providing a new version or two to MAS customers that will make the move easier.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already gotten started. Clipstart 1.4 just shipped with a few new features and better support for recognizing MAS receipt files. I&#8217;ve also submitted it to the Mac App Store, where it is waiting for review.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear where we are going to end up with sandboxing. &#8220;Quoted in Macworld&#8217;s coverage&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/165502/2012/02/sandbox_deadline_delayed_yet_again_to_june_1.html, Paul Kafasis suggests that sandboxing is so flawed that Apple should just scrap the whole thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael Tsai talks about&#8221;:http://mjtsai.com/blog/2012/02/20/sandboxing-and-clipstart/ all the work that is required to stay in the store. He closes with something that I&#8217;ve been thinking about:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At each step of the way, it looks like just a little more work to get into the Mac App Store, or to stay there. Until the next issue pops up. And then, if you&#8217;re successful, you&#8217;re sort of locked into it due to the reasonable expectations of your many customers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This lock-in creates two immediate problems with leaving the Mac App Store:</p>
<ul>
<li>What about customers who may have originally bought the app directly from me, but decided to &#8220;upgrade&#8221; to the Mac App Store version? I&#8217;m sure I only have a few of these, but it&#8217;s still unfortunate if someone bought the app twice. I&#8217;m just glad I didn&#8217;t follow the lead of MAS-exclusive developers, such as &#8220;Pixelmator&#8217;s effort to encourage customers&#8221;:http://www.pixelmator.com/blog/2011/01/06/transition-to-the-mac-app-store/ to switch to the MAS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do current Mac App Store customers get notified that there is a new version available outside the store? Sparkle is not allowed in the MAS, but I think the right thing to do here is provide a similar notification in the app. It would link to a web page with instructions for downloading the app directly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit I have some regret leaving the Mac App Store. It&#8217;s just so convenient for purchasing and installation. If I&#8217;m going to make this work, I&#8217;ll have to redesign my own rather clunky purchase and activation experience. And I&#8217;ll have to do a much better job of marketing, something that has not been easy with Clipstart.</p>

			<p>I wrote a draft of this post a few weeks ago, before Mac OS X Mountain Lion was announced. It was pretty critical of Apple&#8217;s aggressive approach to sandboxing, and I&#8217;ve kept most of that, but the new Gatekeeper feature for Mountain Lion at least gives me a way out. I don&#8217;t think Apple would have created Gatekeeper if they planned to abandon apps sold outside of the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>For the next release of my app <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart</a>, I will be removing it from the Mac App Store and only selling directly from my web site. With Gatekeeper I hope to have some confidence that my customers will still be able to run the app on future versions of the OS.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s take a step back, to a good <a href="http://furbo.org/2012/01/23/sandboxing/">blog post from Craig Hockenberry</a> on moving xScope to use sandboxing. One of the most important things to keep in mind is that what works for one app may be unsuitable for another. Craig touches on this with an example from Panic&#8217;s Transmit:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Of course there are some applications that have a harder time than others: primarily if those apps require access to all or part of the filesystem (think about syncing data with Transmit, for example.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Clipstart also falls into the same &#8220;needs to access the whole file system&#8221; category as Transmit. It&#8217;s not just one feature; the whole app is based on the fact that it can point to video files anywhere on the system, or manage your video library in a central location on any hard drive. These are things that are difficult to do in the sandbox, but even worse, I don&#8217;t see a clear path forward for existing customers to move into such a restrictive environment.</p>
<p>Maybe I could file bugs with Apple for exemptions, and reduce the functionality of my app to fit within the limits of the sandbox, but I&#8217;ve made the decision that it is just not worth it. I would much rather spend 100% of the time I have for Clipstart on new features only, not playing catch-up with Apple.</p>
<p>Atlassian has <a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/2012/02/between-a-rock-and-a-hard-place-our-decision-to-abandon-the-mac-app-store/">made a similar decision</a> for their app SourceTree. On the sandboxing restrictions:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The trouble is, the sandboxing implementation currently in place on Mac OS X Lion doesn&#8217;t allow for all the behaviours that real Mac applications do _right now_, behaviours which are not at all contentious, are approved in the Mac App Store already, and indeed are very much appreciated by users.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/2324/fix-the-sandbox">Daniel Jalkut continues this argument</a>, saying that sandboxing <em>could</em> be good for developers, if only the current entitlements weren&#8217;t so very incomplete. That&#8217;s true. But we can only make decisions based on what entitlements and APIs are there today, and today it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>I will try to make this casualty of sandboxing as painless as possible for Clipstart customers. I will honor Mac App Store receipt files so that everyone can migrate to new versions of the app. And I&#8217;ll provide extra serial numbers to anyone who asks, for fresh installs on machines that never had the Mac App Store version.</p>
<p>Clipstart has turned out to not be a very good fit for the Mac App Store anyway. It&#8217;s the kind of app that you need to download and try out before committing your whole video library to it. Sandboxing is just the latest and most significant in a series of frustrations with the MAS.</p>
<p>For my customers, sandboxing isn&#8217;t actually a feature; it&#8217;s a bottleneck to getting work done. I can&#8217;t justify spending any time on it. I already have a product and platform (<a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> for iOS) where I can play the app review game. I want my Mac app to be a break from that, with a total focus on making the app better and a release schedule and feature set that I control.</p>
<p>So it was a relief to hear about Gatekeeper. I don&#8217;t want pulling Clipstart from the MAS to automatically doom the product, and now I don&#8217;t think it will. Instead of shying away from features that won&#8217;t work in the sandbox, I can even embrace them as a competitive advantage. I&#8217;m more excited than ever to get back to Mac development without this decision and <a href="http://inessential.com/2012/02/17/daniel_on_fixing_the_sandbox">chilling effect</a> hanging over my head.</p>

			<p>A few times since it launched, I&#8217;ve said to friends that Tweet Marker may be the best thing I&#8217;ve done. It has reached more users than any of my indie Mac and iOS apps, and it has been especially rewarding to work with other Twitter developers. It&#8217;s not perfect yet &mdash; there&#8217;s more to improve in future versions of the API and clients &mdash; but I smile every time I see a tweet about how someone can&#8217;t imagine going back to a Twitter client without it.</p>
<p>So it was really gratifying to see &#8220;Macworld recognize Tweet Marker with an Editors&#8217; Choice Award&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/163951/2011/12/the_27th_annual_editors_choice_awards.html for 2011. Thank you Macworld for seeing Tweet Marker as an important part of the Twitter experience.</p>
<p>And thanks to &#8220;all the Twitter app developers&#8221;:http://twitter.com/#!/manton/status/143729811406331905 who have supported Tweet Marker in their apps. We are up to 9 supporting apps across 5 platforms &mdash; Mac, iPhone, iPad, Chrome, and Android &mdash; with more on the way. I&#8217;ve opened up the API to over 40 different clients in various stages of research or testing.</p>
<p>Tweet Marker is a little unique among most of the other Eddy winners this year in that it&#8217;s still completely free. I won&#8217;t see a sales spike following the announcement. If you&#8217;ve been enjoying the service, consider picking up a copy of my iPad app Tweet Library, or donating directly &#8220;on the site&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/.</p>

			<p>The best critique and praise for Heroku is that it&#8217;s opinionated: only deploy with Git, only use PostgreSQL. On the whole this is a good thing, because it simplifies the choices that developers have to make. Fewer choices means more time to spend on things that matter.</p>
<p>But at $200/month for a dedicated database, there&#8217;s a very real cost with PostgreSQL on Heroku. For a service like &#8220;Tweet Marker&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/ that is currently free, I wanted to save money on hosting and simplify things down to a single database. I might have preferred to streamline to PostgreSQL-only, since it&#8217;s rock solid and Heroku&#8217;s tools are excellent for managing backups and moving data around, but Resque (which Tweet Marker uses to process background work) is built on Redis. If I wanted to streamline to a single database, it had to be to Redis.</p>
<p>Tweet Marker as essentially an OAuth-wrapped key/value store anyway, so why burden the app with a full relational database? The handful of extra tables I had for tracking users and sessions could also be migrated to Redis. And even though it&#8217;s a memory database at heart, it is persistent, so I can use it for real data.</p>
<p>I conducted the transition in stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, I was using Redis for stats. Because Redis has an atomic increment command, it&#8217;s trivial to use it to keep counters on various metrics: total number of reads/writes per hour, day, or month, broken down by different Twitter clients. This was my first use of Redis outside Resque tasks and it performed great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, I moved the marker data. I wrote a script to dump all the data from PostgreSQL to Redis, and at the same time modified Tweet Marker to write data to both locations when requests came in. I let that run for about 2 days to confirm that the data was identical in both places before shutting PostgreSQL down and routing reads to Redis only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, I finished moving some additional tables to Redis so that I could completely shutdown PostgreSQL. Again, simple is better.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this was using Heroku&#8217;s &#8220;Redis To Go&#8221;:https://redistogo.com/ add-on. I love it because there&#8217;s no configuration; click a couple buttons and you have a server. But as soon as I was running full time on Redis To Go, I started to be concerned that I had given up a great amount of control over my data. While Redis To Go conveniently offers daily backup snapshots, it doesn&#8217;t appear to have any commands for restoring data or otherwise getting access to the server and Redis files. And though I could probably set up a separate Redis To Go instance and manually send it a slaveof command to turn it into a slave, not being able to edit the config file meant that if the server was rebooted I would lose the slave until it could be reset. Not good.</p>
<p>I also expected I would quickly outgrow the smaller Redis To Go plans, eventually forcing the monthly pricing up to the same level as I was paying for PostgreSQL, but with less control. I had to run my own database server instead. And because Heroku is all on Amazon EC2, it also had to be on EC2 for the best performance between web server and database.</p>
<p>I went to work provisioning an EC2 instance. Initially it ran as a Redis slave to the master on Redis To Go. After I felt comfortable with EC2 and had automated backups in place, I added a separate instance on Amazon for the master and switched the app over to it. The cost for 2 &#8220;micro&#8221; instances is about the same as I was paying for Redis To Go, but with much more available memory, hourly backups to S3, and access to the Redis aof log. And my total monthly hosting costs are about half what they were before.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to keep this setup for at least the rest of the year and well into next. As the Tweet Marker user base grows, I&#8217;ll bump up to higher-capacity EC2 instances. Heroku continues to be really great, so I don&#8217;t expect to change anything there.</p>

			<p>The short version of this post is: &#8220;please vote for my SXSW talk&#8221;:http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/11867, which I&#8217;ve proposed with David Barnard of App Cubby. If selected, we&#8217;ll be talking about how to innovate on top of Twitter, using examples from the history of Twitter apps in the App Store including Tweet Marker, Tweet Library, and David&#8217;s upcoming app Tweet Speaker. Equal parts business and APIs, I hope it&#8217;ll capture how much we can still do if we think beyond the Twitter basics.</p>
<p>The longer story is that SXSW is always changing. I started this blog on the first day of SXSW 2002, when the conference was just a few rooms in a single hallway, and I&#8217;ve seen it grow to more than a few <em>venues</em> spread across downtown Austin and even farther out. That&#8217;s okay. There&#8217;s a place for small events, as SXSW once was, and there&#8217;s a place for <em>the</em> event where the blogging, design, social network, and software folks can meet in one place.</p>
<p>Take the Mac and iOS development world. This year alone has NSConference, Voices That Matter, 360|iDev, 360|MacDev, CocoaConf, MacTech, &Ccedil;ingleton, and SecondConf. These attract developers from all over the country, but most people can attend one at most, and many events are regional conferences at heart.</p>
<p>We need WWDC as the single place. No matter how great the smaller conferences are, WWDC is the big one, the one you don&#8217;t miss. And so it is with SXSW.</p>
<p>I believe SXSW 2012 is going to be fascinating to watch. A couple years past when everyone already thought it was too big, 2012 could see real turnover. Some previous attendees will skip it, and many new people will speak for the first time. I want to see that conference, to find out what its themes and focus will be, and hopefully &#8220;our talk&#8221;:http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/11867 can be part of it.</p>

			<p>The second app to support &#8220;Tweet Marker&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/ has arrived, and it&#8217;s a great one: &#8220;Tweetbot&#8221;:http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/. I love using Tweetbot on the iPhone and Twitterrific on the Mac and iPad. Seeing these apps work together just makes for a better Twitter experience.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind while using apps that support Tweet Marker:</p>
<p><em>Turn it on!</em> First things first: enable Tweet Marker in both apps on every device you plan to use Twitter on. MacStories has a good summary of this (with screenshots) for &#8220;their coverage of Twitterrific&#8221;:http://www.macstories.net/mac/twitterrific-4-3-syncs-timeline-position-with-tweet-marker/ and &#8220;again for Tweetbot&#8221;:http://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-1-6-gets-tweet-marker-timeline-sync/.</p>
<p><em>What syncs?</em> Only the main timeline and mentions sync between the apps. While working with these developers, we made a decision to change how Twitter lists sync after Twitterrific had already shipped. So while both apps think they are syncing lists, the format on the server is not compatible between the two. A future version should fix this.</p>
<p><em>How to switch apps?</em> Most apps take the approach of saving the last-read position when the app is quit or sent to the background, and restoring it again when it is launched or brought to the front. You may need to change your default habits a little to get the most accurate behavior. When you know you are going to switch apps, just close your active Twitter client first before opening the next one. It may also help to wait for the app to download new tweets before scrolling or interacting with it.</p>

			<p>Today was day 7 of the &#8220;first app&#8221;:http://twitterrific.com/ to ship with Tweet Marker support. Overall, things have been working great. I thought I&#8217;d write a little bit about my hosting experience so far.</p>
<p>First, the good news: the service is up and fast. Twitterrific is sending a lot of traffic, even with the preference off by default, but the server app is architected in such a way that things are zipping along nicely. Performance is especially important on the iPhone, where a Twitter client might be saving state on quit and any lag would be pretty obvious. Non-trivial server work, such as hitting the Twitter API, is done in the background using Resque, and the queue size there is usually small too.</p>
<p>There have been two distinct problems, though. Each was a good opportunity to improve the system.</p>
<p>On the first day, the background queue stalled and the requests piled up, so much so that my Redis instance ran out of memory and clients started receiving errors. I upgraded Redis, restarted the app, and bumped up the number of processes to quickly catch up on the backlog. Although it hasn&#8217;t resulted in errors since, it has delayed some requests on 2 more occasions after launch. I also adjusted how I&#8217;m collecting statistics to further improve performance.</p>
<p>More recently, I&#8217;ve noticed some sporadic SSL errors when Tweet Marker tries to verify the user account via Twitter. I added more wait-and-retry logic, and I&#8217;m keeping an eye on this to kick the background script if necessary. There have been no errors in the last couple days.</p>
<p>I still think it was the right decision to host on Heroku. Although I am manually monitoring the server for general health (need to automate this badly), everything is less work than I would do with a colocated box or VPS. The biggest cost is that at the last minute I upgraded to Heroku&#8217;s dedicated PostgreSQL database. I&#8217;m still evaluating that, but I would rather launch with too much horsepower and scale it down later, than not enough.</p>
<p>Again, thanks for your support. It is a little nerve-racking because I know that &#8220;other people&#8221;:http://www.iconfactory.com/ are depending on Tweet Marker being up and performing well. This is a different experience for me than working at a &#8220;larger company&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ with a dedicated system administrator, and also different than server backends for my Riverfold products, where it is only my own customers who will be disappointed if I fail.</p>

			<p>And now for something completely different. I released a bug fix update to &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ last night, the first in over a year. It doesn&#8217;t have some of the bigger things I&#8217;d like to finish for the app, but it does have an important bug fix to Mii rendering.</p>
<p>At some point in a recent update to Safari or Mac OS X, Miis started appearing blank in Wii Transfer. These are rendered in an offscreen window using Flash, then saved as thumbnails in Wii Transfer with the option to export a JPEG. The fix &mdash; for reasons I&#8217;m still not clear on &mdash; was to switch to using NSBitmapImageRep&#8217;s cacheDisplayInRect instead of initWithFocusedViewRect. Needless to say, customers were frustrated that this was no longer working, and I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t take care of the problem more quickly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot lately about the future of Wii Transfer and its companion &#8220;@wii&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii Twitter account. This little Mac app is overdue for a rename and refocused feature set.</p>

			<p>Tweet Marker is getting big. I couldn&#8217;t be more excited that &#8220;Twitterrific 4.3 is now shipping&#8221;:http://twitterrific.com/ with syncing across Mac, iPad, and iPhone. &#8220;Users love it&#8221;:http://tweetlibrary.com/manton/twitterrific4.3 and many are rediscovering Twitterrific or becoming new customers just because of this feature.</p>
<p>More apps are coming, too. Craig Hockenberry, from a &#8220;Macworld article by Dan Moren&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/161655/2011/08/tweet_marker_shows_twitter_client_developers_still_innovating.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The real value is having something that works well across the entire Twitter ecosystem. It&#8217;s our belief that Tweet Marker will become more useful as more clients support it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I struggled with how to build, price, and launch Tweet Marker. The first developers to use it are taking a risk, so I felt I had to remove the friction of supporting the service by making the API free. To cover hosting costs, I plan to later make an optional paid subscription available for developers who want more than the basics.</p>
<p>But we&#8217;re not there yet, and some people have asked how they can support Tweet Marker directly. As an experiment, I&#8217;ve put up a donation button over &#8220;on the Tweet Marker site&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/. Think of it as a small investment in the service, a bootstrap to get things off the ground and remove the stress of scaling.</p>
<p>It is not, however, a substitute for supporting client developers. Please pick up a copy of Twitterrific, and when my app Tweet Library is available with sync I hope you&#8217;ll consider that as well. Thanks!</p>

			<p>Five years ago today, I joined Twitter as its 897th user, though for some reason &#8220;my first tweet&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/1457463 wasn&#8217;t until a few months later. So much has changed in the meantime &mdash; the API always in flux, the transition from primarily SMS, to web, to apps &mdash; but in many ways the core of the service remains intact and stronger than ever. Short messages, distributed efficiently to friends.</p>
<p>I talked about some of the good and bad of being a Twitter developer &#8220;on the ATX Web Show last week&#8221;:http://atxwebshow.com/2011/07/05/episode-34-tweet-library-with-manton/. There have been a string of changes that cause developers to scramble: turning off basic auth, discouraging mainstream clients, disabling DMs for xAuth. With each step, Twitter loses a little goodwill, and that&#8217;s demonstrated in the tweets I &#8220;collected over the xAuth change&#8221;:http://tweetlibrary.com/manton/xauthtooauth.</p>
<p>Even as Twitter passes 1 million registered apps, there&#8217;s a risk that some developers will stick with the platform as users only, putting their apps in maintenance mode. In May, &#8220;Kiwi developer Isaiah stopped development&#8221;:http://yourhead.tumblr.com/post/5550105265/i-love-you-kiwi-i-know of his Mac Twitter app:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just going to take a break from Kiwi for a while. It&#8217;s still for sale. I still support it. I&#8217;ll still fix bugs when they crop up. But adding new features and playing catch up with the other guys/gals is off the table.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe because I don&#8217;t have to depend on Tweet Library sales, I tend to more stubbornly ignore what is good business sense. There&#8217;s so much I still want to do. As &#8220;I wrote in my previous take&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/03/twitters.html on the state of the platform: &#8220;I&#8217;m a little discouraged, but not enough to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s doubly true today. More annoyed, but also more determined to plug holes in the platform, from archiving to syncing. I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about the developers who are building in &#8220;Tweet Marker&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/ support.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s always a chance, a feeling that something big is just around the corner. That if I don&#8217;t add that one feature, or open up that new API, I&#8217;ll miss the tipping point that makes Tweet Library really take off.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m fascinated with the iPad &#8220;3&#8221; rumors because on the surface they make so little sense. Apple just shipped the iPad 2, no competitors can match it, and demand is strong. Why mess with a good thing so soon?</p>
<p>But it almost fits when <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/11/ipad-pro">you give it a name like &#8220;Pro&#8221;</a> (or iPad Retina, or whatever). This isn&#8217;t a replacement for the current iPad; it&#8217;s another layer to the product lineup. And like the awkwardly-named iPod Photo from 2004, I bet the iPad Pro is meant to be temporary. It&#8217;s a way to sell a high-end, over-priced and over-pixeled iPad before the technology is cheap enough for the masses. A year or two from now, the Retina Display will be available in all iPads, and the &#8220;Pro&#8221; name will fade away, just like iPod Photo did when all iPods got a color screen.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Guy English writes about iCloud&#8221;:http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/202 and the magic glue (Push Notifications&#8217; persistent connection) that makes it work:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Each of these new features tickle the persistent &#8216;push&#8217; connection and trigger some action on the device. The short-form state may be transmitted immediately and set on any connected device within moments. Document syncing is likely to trigger a negotiation process to compare the state on any one device with The Truth stored on Apple servers and replace the document on the device with the latest revision &mdash; this has the advantage of limiting the window between syncing where conflicts are most likely to occur.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sync speed matters. The first note sharing server I built for VitalSource years ago assumed a lot of offline time, and despite &#8220;my blogging in 2007 that it was&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/bookshelf_note_sharing.html &#8220;magic&#8221;, in practice it could take 5-10 minutes before all your computers got their act together to get a set of highlights completely synced. With that kind of lag, note edits might happen on a client in the meantime, so we remembered conflicts everywhere and had a UI for resolving them.</p>
<p>Too complicated. The new system, recently rolled out in Bookshelf for iPhone and iPad, syncs so much more efficiently and quickly that conflicts don&#8217;t need the same emphasis. We can throw away a bunch of code and simplify the user interface.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve yet to do anything with iCloud except read the release notes and sit through a couple WWDC sessions, but we&#8217;re going to have a fantastic platform if it can deliver the same speed and reliability of Push Notifications. Guy&#8217;s post is the first I&#8217;ve seen to connect the dots, capturing how well-positioned Apple is to use this plumbing for all sorts of stuff.</p>
