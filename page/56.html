			<p>&#8220;Great post from Garrett Dimon&#8221;:http://garrettdimon.com/post/6724266888/my-biggest-mistake, on his biggest mistake building the bug-tracker Sifter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I got bogged down watching our bottom-line even though we&#8217;ve always been comfortably profitable. I worried about preventing fraud even though the only instance we ever encountered only cost us $200. I constantly worried that Sifter could go down at any moment even though we&#8217;ve had 99.96% uptime since launch. [&#8230;] All of these little things were distracting me from the work that really mattered.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For a small company, focusing on the wrong things will make or break a product. I&#8217;m guilty of the same thing. I sat on &#8220;Tweetmarks&#8221;:http://tweetmarks.net/ for 6 months without launching it because I was worried about how to pay for hosting and how to get developers involved.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&#8217;s no obvious solution <em>until you ship</em>. Eventually it becomes easier to know when to be patient &mdash; to solve a problem right the first time &mdash; and when it&#8217;s needless worrying over something that may or may not even happen. And as 37signals says: &#8220;decisions are temporary&#8221;:http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch06_Done.php anyway.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve been sitting on this post for a while. First the good news: &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ is in the Mac App Store. Overall I was very happy with the response and glad to have a new way for customers to find the app.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve received a bunch of good feedback on &#8220;my blog post about Apple&#8217;s 30% cut&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/01/app_store_30_cut.html. A few people are really upset with Apple, and there are posts in the dev forums about Mac apps that still weren&#8217;t approved for one reason or another weeks after the store launched. Other developers keep quiet, either for fear of rocking the boat or because they are happy with their sales and don&#8217;t see a significant problem.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s most of us who know Apple can do even better. We&#8217;re frustrated when an app (not just our own) is rejected or stuck in review indefinitely, but we just accept that things are a little dysfunctional and cross our fingers that maybe Apple will magically become more transparent.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not going to happen by itself. It&#8217;s not going to happen because the culture of Apple under Steve Jobs is secrecy. Apple is about great products, sure, but they&#8217;re so obsessed with the big reveal that it weakens their communication with developers.</p>
<p>From a &#8220;MacSB mailing list post about WWDC&#8221;:http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/macsb/message/18055 by Dave Howell, written back in February:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Second, Apple employees are no longer allowed to talk about anything. In the past, half of the value of WWDC was talking directly to the folks who wrote the OS frameworks you have questions about. But now the answer to any question is always either &#8216;file a bug&#8217; or &#8216;send an email to devprograms@apple.com.&#8217; They&#8217;re all under a gag order.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The baffling part is that many of the problems in the App Store process are easily solvable. The iTunes Connect team could, for example, make it a priority to answer all email. I don&#8217;t know what the organizational structure is over there, and I&#8217;m sympathetic to what must be a flood of app submissions, but it doesn&#8217;t feel like App Store support gets the same quality treatment that Developer Technical Support does.</p>
<p>Contrast with &#8220;Gus Mueller&#8217;s point on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/ccgus/status/24200147764256768:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you on the 30% + silence issue. With PayPal, they&#8217;ll call me back when I email them with problems or questions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Michael Tsai echoes this&#8221;:http://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/01/09/mac-app-store-unanswered-questions/ on his blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The main value of Apple&#8217;s 30% cut is access to a larger market, but it still doesn&#8217;t look good that companies such as PayPal, eSellerate, and E-junkie charge much less and provide great service. I can e-mail or call those companies and get answers right away.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Good support takes extra resources and it costs money. Luckily Apple has both, and that&#8217;s why drawing attention to Apple&#8217;s 30% cut was key to my original argument. Developers are playing by Apple&#8217;s rules and helping to fund the App Store.</p>
<p>Despite all this, I&#8217;m upbeat. In 2011 I want to look for ways that I can help Apple succeed, such as filing bugs. For years I swore off bothering, because it took so long to turn around a fix, if ever, and I had long since worked around a bug and moved on. iOS changes that delay because it improves so significantly every single year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for &#8220;praising Apple when it&#8217;s deserved&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/2011/02/04/ode-to-the-app-review-team, but history shows that Apple improves the App Store when people complain. My posts are negative when it&#8217;s warranted and worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>The App Store is getting better. (I love that the Resolution Center is there even if I hope to never need to use it.) The writing is on the wall that a year from now most apps will be distributed through the Mac App Store, and the savings and independence of direct download sales won&#8217;t be worth the maintenance of two separate forms of distribution for many developers. But if Apple holds all the cards in this relationship, then <em>we must hold Apple</em> to a very high standard.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;This device isn&#8217;t a spaceship; it&#8217;s a time machine. It goes backwards, forwards. It takes us to a place where we ache to go again. It&#8217;s not called the wheel; it&#8217;s called the carousel. It lets us travel the way a child travels &mdash; around and around, and back home again, to a place where we know we were loved.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When I first saw this a couple years ago I thought of Steve Jobs, the master pitchman in our industry. The delivery is different, more personal here, but it was stunning as part of the full episode. Who doesn&#8217;t want to build products that resonate so well, that go from nice utilities or productivity apps to something our customers fall in love with?</p>
<p>First you build a product that changes things, that is truly useful. Something ambitious. Then find a way to sell it that connects, and underscore why it matters.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really know how to do this yet. But I do know that part of it is telling stories. Why did I create &#8220;Tweet Library&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/? To tell stories, to remember events that matter before they&#8217;re lost in the fleeting stream of old tweets. It&#8217;s the kind of nostalgia at the heart of the Mad Men clip.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like this post from Kyle Neath of GitHub&#8221;:http://warpspire.com/posts/idea-businesses/, that it&#8217;s about ideas, not products (via &#8220;Duncan Davidson&#8221;:http://duncandavidson.com/):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People want to be part of ideas. Being part of a company who builds a successful product is cool&#8230; but being part of an idea is a lot more attractive. If you can build a business where both your employees and your customers think they&#8217;re part of an idea, you&#8217;ve created something special.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If you can extract the core idea from a great product, everything that comes next can be matched to the idea, so the product has a clear path for new features. Building a story around it &mdash; something that sticks, and having the resources to tell that story properly &mdash; takes a lot of work. I&#8217;m inspired when I see others do it well, and it&#8217;s an art I hope to make time for.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>This year&#8217;s WWDC keynote was one of the most significant of the last few years. Twitter integration and iCloud were the highlights for me, although at the end of the week I&#8217;m still not sure when or how I&#8217;ll be able to use either. But I love that it was a software-only event &mdash; that&#8217;s how WWDC should be &mdash; and I love that there were major new features on both of Apple&#8217;s platforms.</p>
<p>A few of the announcements seemed to have significant overlap (if not direct competition) with third-party developers, in particular Instapaper, Camera+, and the dozens of to-do list apps in the store. You can see some of that live reaction in a &#8220;collection of tweets&#8221;:http://tweetlibrary.com/manton/wwdc2011 I put together at the conference.</p>
<p>My first thought for Marco Arment was that he should come out with a new product. Not because I&#8217;m worried about Instapaper, but just because I&#8217;d love to see what he&#8217;d build next. &#8220;Marco is still upbeat on Instapaper&#8217;s chances&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/2011/06/06/safari-reader-and-instapaper for continued success:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If Reading List gets widely adopted and millions of people start saving pages for later reading, a portion of those people will be interested in upgrading to a dedicated, deluxe app and service to serve their needs better. And they&#8217;ll quickly find Instapaper in the App Store.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet here&#8217;s Dave Winer, &#8220;reflecting on when Apple competed with his product&#8221;:http://scripting.com/stories/2011/06/06/anotherGreatSboringsLovely.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I think the answer is to find meaning in your work independent of what happens with the fickleness of the platform vendor and its developers. I went on to take the same software that Apple crushed and turned it into blogging, RSS, podcasting, web APIs, all kinds of cool stuff. And yes it did eventually make me a bunch of money. But not the way everyone thought it would.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As Dave used to say, zig where they zag. Find the unique value in the apps you build and spin those out as separate products or use as inspiration for new features. Daniel and I have talked about this on Core Intuition: pull your app&#8217;s strength into a competition advantage by reusing code and adding more depth than anyone starting from scratch.</p>
<p>By playing to your strengths, you can do more, faster. Every indie Mac and iOS developer should be thinking about a suite of products.</p>
<p>&#8220;Justin Williams hits this&#8221;:http://carpeaqua.com/2011/06/07/the-agony-and-the-ecstasy-of-wwdc/ in the context of WWDC:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Some people grow frustrated by Apple continually making inroads in existing developer&#8217;s territory, but it comes with being a part of the platform. The key is to ensure your product lineup is diverse enough that you can survive taking the blow Apple may offer at the next keynote.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>You should make the choice to diversify before you&#8217;re forced to make it, because WWDC is already a full year of choices rolled up into one week. Dropbox/Simplenote and iCloud, OAuth and Twitter.framework, iOS 4 and 5, Retain/Release and ARC. Like the &#8220;Persians deliberating while both drunk and sober&#8221;:http://skepticalphilosopher.blogspot.com/2009/09/persian-strategy-deliberating-while.html (&#8220;via Buzz Andersen&#8221;:http://twitter.com/buzz/status/76502320514465793), if you make any real decisions during WWDC&#8217;s info intoxication, make them again a week later.</p>
<p>Marco has a clear advantage over his new competition, though, regardless of whether he creates new products or sticks with Instapaper. &#8220;Send to Instapaper&#8221; is built into every great Twitter app and newsreader. It took years to build such widespread integration, and it won&#8217;t be easy (even for Apple) to be on equal footing with such a well-loved and established brand.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I mentioned in &#8220;my first post about Tweet Marker&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/06/tweet_marker.html that there were some decisions still to be made about the service. I don&#8217;t know everything yet, but I do want to answer some common questions I&#8217;m hearing from users and developers.</p>
<p><em>Will Tweet Marker be free?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I do not plan to charge users directly to use the service. There will also be no charge to developers for the basic sync API. However, it will take on real hosting costs, so I plan to have a more advanced paid plan (with more features and stats) so that participating Twitter apps can help pay for the service.</p>
<p><em>How useful is it if the official Twitter app doesn&#8217;t support it?</em></p>
<p>It is still very useful for users of third-party Twitter clients. I couldn&#8217;t allow the official Twitter app to use the API even if they wanted to, because theirs is a free app and has such a huge number of users. I also like that Tweet Marker becomes a selling point and discovery tool for other apps.</p>
<p><em>Shouldn&#8217;t Twitter provide this service as part of their API?</em></p>
<p>That would be great, but Twitter doesn&#8217;t seem interested in providing such a service. They don&#8217;t encourage users to read everything in their timeline, and it would be a little at odds with their focus on only the latest tweets.</p>
<p><em>Why aren&#8217;t you using Apple&#8217;s new iCloud?</em></p>
<p>The primary goal with Tweet Marker is to enable different Twitter apps to work together. iCloud is designed for storage and syncing only between apps from the same developer, so it&#8217;s not appropriate as a replacement architecture for Tweet Marker.</p>
<p><em>Where is it hosted and what language was it written in?</em></p>
<p>It is hosted on Heroku, which also powers the web site for my iPad app Tweet Library. Tweet Marker is written in Ruby with the Sinatra framework, and backed by PostgreSQL.</p>
<p><em>What about sample code for building this into an app?</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on an example project for Mac and iOS. In the meantime, remember that it uses OAuth Echo, which is what most Twitter apps should already be using to post to Twitpic and Yfrog. Just change the URL to use the Tweet Marker server and include the tweet status ID in the POST body. To retrieve the value, it&#8217;s just a GET request without authentication. &#8220;See the docs&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/ for more.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> I reworded the part above about whether the service will be free, since I don&#8217;t control how third-party clients will make this feature available to their users. I also updated it to reflect the service name change from Tweetmarks to Tweet Marker.</p>

			<p>So you want to sync the last-read tweet with all your different Twitter apps on iPhone, iPad, and Mac? Yeah, me too. While I hope to build a version of Tweet Library for other platforms, what I&#8217;d also love is to be able to switch between clients and know that each one will pick up where I was last reading in the timeline.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m introducing a new service for Twitter developers: &#8220;Tweet Marker&#8221;:http://tweetmarks.net/.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already showed it off to a few developers, and if you&#8217;re writing a Twitter app I&#8217;d love for you to support it too. It will be baked into the next version of Tweet Library.</p>
<p>There are still some unknowns (especially around whether I will need to ask for help to cover hosting costs), but I wanted to launch it now before WWDC so that other Twitter app developers meeting at the conference can give me feedback on the service. Tweet Marker has actually been running for months, and when an opportunity came along this week for a new logo (&#8220;thanks Alex!&#8221;:http://dribbble.com/solonsky), I knew it was past time to finish documenting the service and get it out.</p>
<p>To be successful it needs at least 2 apps to support it (I&#8217;ll supply one of those). I&#8217;ve tried to solve all the other basic problems. It&#8217;s simple, fast, scalable on Heroku, and protected so that mischief-makers can&#8217;t tamper with tweet IDs.</p>
<p>Send me an email or find me in person next week if you have any feedback.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em> This post has been updated to reflect the service name change from Tweetmarks to Tweet Marker.</p>

			<p>&#8220;David Barnard chimes in&#8221;:http://davidbarnard.com/post/5649151852/orchestrating-magic on The Daily:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The carousel is a fun bit of UI (at least in theory, it&#8217;s still a bit laggy and jittery for my taste), but there&#8217;s just no way to quickly deliver enough content to make the carousel usable. The front page and table of contents, on the other hand, could likely be fully delivered in the 4-5 seconds from the launch of the app to the end of the launch animation. Sending users directly to the front page (or potentially a redesigned table of contents, but I wont get into that) will make it feel as though the app has been magically filled with content.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>David makes some great points. Put another way, if some of their design decisions were too ambitious for their technical plumbing to keep up with, they should update the design and optimize it for speed. With such a mainstream app, though, you can&#8217;t really win. I&#8217;m sure if it was only fast and not fancy, it would have been criticized as too bland.</p>
<p>The initial criticism of &#8220;The Daily&#8221;:http://www.thedaily.com/ always seemed overblown to me. It&#8217;s not perfect, but they got some of the difficult things right: navigation that makes sense, original content, good layout, clear subscription model.</p>
<p>Off and on for the first few weeks, I would read several articles each day in The Daily. There were a couple crashes and glitches, but nothing that made the app unusable. If no one else had been complaining, I&#8217;m not sure I would have noticed anything so wrong it was worth mentioning.</p>
<p>They can make it faster and polish up the rough edges over a few subsequent bug fix releases. And maybe enough of the fundamentals are right that they can get pretty far even without the design changes David suggests.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve &#8220;written a few e-book apps&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/, I can say with certainty that getting the basics right is more challenging than it looks. Other traditional companies moving their content to the iPad have launched much farther off-course than The Daily.</p>

			<p>After about a day of using Tweetbot, &#8220;I said&#8221;:https://twitter.com/manton/status/58723721728360448:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tweetbot gets nearly everything in the UI right. Love it. But.. it&#8217;s a basic client. I still think the future for third parties is features.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I only got a few responses, most defending Tweetbot as something special. I agree, and there&#8217;s a lot to be inspired by from it. In an odd way, though, just being the best Twitter client isn&#8217;t enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marco Arment writes more&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/2011/04/18/ben-brooks-on-tweetbot (following a &#8220;post from Ben Brooks&#8221;:http://brooksreview.net/2011/04/appsuration/) about why Tweetbot isn&#8217;t for him despite being such a good client:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A new Twitter client that essentially offers the Twitter app&#8217;s features, but in different places, isn&#8217;t enough of a difference for me to switch. If anything, it supports Twitter&#8217;s &#8216;don&#8217;t make full-featured apps&#8217; position. Maybe they were right.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem isn&#8217;t that third parties shouldn&#8217;t make full-featured clients; it&#8217;s that they shouldn&#8217;t make clients that have <em>exactly the same features as every other client</em>. If Twitter discourages all apps from being made just because many will fail, we&#8217;ll miss out on all the things Twitter will never add to their apps and platform.</p>
<p>I see three compelling reasons to use Tweetbot 1.0: the design, swipe for conversations, and related tweets. The last is actually in the Twitter API &mdash; I&#8217;ve been meaning to add it to Tweet Library &mdash; but it&#8217;s not yet documented outside of an email message to the dev mailing list. Congrats to Tapbots for being the first I&#8217;ve seen to add it as a high-profile feature.</p>
<p>Last September I wrote about &#8220;next-generation Twitter apps&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/09/next_generation.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I believe we&#8217;re about to see a third generation of clients that will go way beyond what the web site can do. There was worry when Twitter bought Tweetie that it would destroy the third-party Twitter market, and sure, some developers will fail or be discouraged from trying to compete against a free official product. But really what it does is raise the bar &mdash; that to succeed Twitter clients should be more than just a one-to-one mapping between UI and the Twitter API.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t announced Tweet Library yet when I wrote that. Now that I&#8217;ve shipped it, I believe even more strongly that we haven&#8217;t seen anything yet from Twitter apps. Tweetbot is a great 1.0 and my go-to app on the phone because it&#8217;s better in lots of small ways than anything else. But that it&#8217;s not for everyone is actually great news. I hope there are plenty of unique features still to come from a variety of other apps.</p>
<p>Consider this: Tweetie already &#8220;won&#8221; the market. No matter what we do as Twitter API developers, none of us can ever have the most popular Twitter app. This frees every app to focus on its core strength. For Twitterrific, that&#8217;s a unified timeline; for Echofon, that&#8217;s last-read sync; for Hibari, that&#8217;s keywords; for Kiwi, that&#8217;s themes; for my own Tweet Library, that&#8217;s curation.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s Tweetbot&#8217;s core strength? For now, overall user experience, not standout features. But I&#8217;ve been a Tapbots customer long enough that I&#8217;m excited to see where they take it.</p>

			<p>On a &#8220;recent Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2011/03/episode-38-the-impression-of-standing-still/, Daniel and I talked about version numbers and the message you send by going to 2.0 or 3.0. The version is as much about marketing as it is about technically tracking the release.</p>
<p>I can think of no better example of this than &#8220;Acorn 3&#8221;:http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/. The app started simply enough &mdash; first as just a new FlySketch, then as a simple image editor, then becoming more advanced with each iteration &mdash; but it has really hit its stride with 3.0. The landmark feature, layer styles, alone warrants the bump to 3.0.</p>
<p>Combine with the overall maturity of the app and you get a blockbuster release. Acorn made the top grossing list and was outselling all other non-Apple software. My Twitter stream lit up with good things about the app.</p>
<p>The version number is a part of that. This isn&#8217;t a 2.5. The 3.0 is saying: this is big news, and anyone who has maybe heard of Acorn but never tried it needs to give this version a shot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m particularly happy for Gus because he&#8217;s earned this success over years. From the archives in 2005, &#8220;Gus&#8217;s post on being an indie&#8221;:http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/25.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Just plan, set realistic goals, meet those goals, diversify, save up, add four cups of patience, and have fun. And most importantly- work your ass off. It&#8217;s not difficult, it&#8217;s just not easy. It takes time and patience and hard work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			<p>My post on free apps &#8220;was linked from Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/18/manton-app-store a few days ago. Tons of new traffic, but my site didn&#8217;t go down. Why? An ancient but reliable version of Movable Type spitting out static files, with just a tiny bit of PHP for &#8220;Mint stats&#8221;:http://haveamint.com/.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brent Simmons talks about this lost art&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs of publishing to static files instead of serving from a database:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an old technique, actually, but too rarely practiced. (Lots of weblogs in the &#8217;90s were rendered as files-on-disk. They were built from a database plus templates and scripts and uploaded to a server. We did a bunch of this when I worked with Dave Winer at UserLand Software.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more with Brent&#8217;s advice, and in fact I ran this blog on Radio Userland for its first couple of years. In addition to performance, static files are portable. I can pick up this site and move it anywhere. The old web is fragile, and as web sites age, being able to permanently host them somewhere cheap and stable is going to become a big deal.</p>
<p>I hope a modern equivalent to Movable Type emerges eventually. For now, I&#8217;m thankful that the only time I have to worry about a web site outage is when a Dreamhost sysadmin trips over a power cord.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Twitter recommended upgrading to OAuth <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/security_best_practices">&#8220;for optimal security&#8221;</a> and so developers don&#8217;t need to <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/announcements">&#8220;worry about the user changing their password&#8221;</a>. While I dislike APIs that break old clients, I saw mostly the good things about OAuth, framed around letting the user approve access to their own account.</p>
<p>Seven months ago, as Twitter was finishing the OAuth transition, &#8220;Buzz Andersen tweeted this&#8221;:http://twitter.com/buzz/statuses/21402358130:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Twitter isn&#8217;t just enforcing OAuth for technical reasons: it&#8217;s a way of taking control of the platform.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I got it at the time. Twitter was all about open APIs, right? They encouraged new clients, and the original Mac client Twitterrific had &#8220;brought a lot of innovation and standards&#8221;:http://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/ to the platform. Why would they need this level of control?</p>
<p>&#8220;The email from Ryan Sarver&#8221;:http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a/7dd46c26157c9e29 last week showed part of how Twitter is changing as a company, refocusing from building a network to selling a product. Reading between the lines, it seems that to effectively sell ads, Twitter feels they need to control the user experience. On Twitter clients:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Developers have told us that they&#8217;d like more guidance from us about the best opportunities to build on Twitter. More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The answer is no.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Disappointing. At a panel on the Twitter API at SXSW, that sadly no one from Twitter in Austin knew about, the mood was pretty dim. I said to the room that we expected more from Twitter.</p>
<p>Then over the weekend, Ryan clarified: &#8220;we are saying it&#8217;s not a good business to be in but we aren&#8217;t shutting them off or telling devs they can&#8217;t build them.&#8221; There&#8217;s still plenty of uncertainty, but that&#8217;s a more hopeful message. I collected some additional &#8220;related tweets on tweetlibrary.com&#8221;:http://tweetlibrary.com/manton/twitterapirules.</p>
<p>Many people during SXSW asked me what this means for Tweet Library. Is Tweet Library a mainstream Twitter client? It has all the basic features of a normal client, but no, not really. It&#8217;s meant to be something more, something unique that solves problems no one else is working on, least of all Twitter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little discouraged, but not enough to stop. I owe it to my customers to finish what I started: to fix bugs, add new features, polish the rough edges, and make Tweet Library the best app on the Twitter platform.</p>

			<p>Jens Alfke, &#8220;commenting on the new Rdio API&#8221;:http://jens.mooseyard.com/2011/03/dudes-this-is-so-not-rest/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Maybe we should just give up on the term REST, since it&#8217;s become so diluted as to mean nothing more than &#8216;HTTP API that&#8217;s not as hard to use as SOAP&#8217;?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds right. &#8220;Pure REST&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer was never strictly followed, and the advantage to consistent HTTP methods &mdash; being able to abstract parts of the client details away, as with &#8220;ActiveResource&#8221;:http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveResource/Base.html &mdash; don&#8217;t seem like significant savings to me. Now that XML-RPC and SOAP are mostly dead, we assume that new APIs are going to be usable from any language without much effort. I won&#8217;t object to having one less acronym in the world.</p>

			<p>Today is the 9th anniversary of this blog. Once a year I dig through old posts, remembering what the industry was like and the topics I was interested in. This time I found a link to a post Evan Williams wrote in 2001 as Pyra Labs and Blogger were struggling:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;First of all, the company (Pyra) is not dead, and the service (Blogger) is not going away. However: We are out of money, and I have lost my team.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yes, things would have been very, very different if the Internet Bubble wouldn&#8217;t have burst and we were still in that&#8230;that, Other World in which we started. In that world, things that seem dumb now (such as launching a product and letting it grow for so long without making revenue from it a priority) made sense.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The full text is &#8220;available on the Wayback Machine&#8221;:http://replay.waybackmachine.org/200102040700/http://www.evhead.com/longer/2200706_essays.asp. I wish more CEOs blogged with even half the sincerity.</p>
<p>SXSW Interactive starts this weekend. When Evan wrote the above, the conference was a few rooms along a single hallway. Now it&#8217;s a monster conference, spread across multiple venues, with a speaker database so dense I don&#8217;t even know where to start. Still, I&#8217;ll be there and hope to catch up with any of y&#8217;all making it to Austin.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/03/dirty_percent">John Gruber has a solid summary</a> of the issues around in-app purchase. Regarding the closed platform:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;iOS isn&#8217;t and never was an open computer system. It&#8217;s a closed, controlled console system &mdash; more akin to Playstation or Wii or Xbox than to Mac OS X or Windows. It is, in Apple&#8217;s view, a privilege to have a native iOS app.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the root of nearly every strength and problem with the App Store. I&#8217;ll never be happy about it. But in-app purchase restrictions are even more complicated than that. It started not just with the controlled environment but the decisions around free apps.</p>
<p><a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2011/02/24/app-store-revenue-stream/">Michael Tsai points to this Peter Oppenheimer quote</a> from late February that Apple runs the App Store at &#8220;just a little over breakeven&#8221;. I&#8217;ve argued that Apple&#8217;s 30% tax is about growing that to significant profit at the expense of developers, but in the back of my head I&#8217;ve also been concerned that maybe it&#8217;s just to keep the App Store from falling into the red. Maybe they are really struggling under the weight of what they created, and long app review times and lack of focus around the Mac App Store launch are just symptoms of that.</p>
<p>If this is true, then I&#8217;m more sympathetic to Apple&#8217;s predicament. They aren&#8217;t being greedy; they&#8217;re just trying not to lose money. But that doesn&#8217;t mean they didn&#8217;t make a mistake.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, announcing the App Store in March 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You know what price a lot of developers are going to pick? Free, right? So when a developer wants to distribute their app for free, there is no charge for free apps. At all. There&#8217;s no charge to the user, and there&#8217;s no charge to the developer. We&#8217;re going to pay for everything to get those apps out there for free. The developer and us have the same exact interest, which is to get as many apps out in front of as many iPhone users as possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I remember being surprised when I heard this. We take for granted now that much of the App Store&#8217;s success is because of free apps, but I&#8217;m not sure it had to be that way. The iTunes Music Store launched with a full paid catalog of music. Many of the hits in the App Store, like Angry Birds and Doodle Jump, have never been free.</p>
<p>But watching Steve Jobs from 2008, you can tell Apple was worried that what happened to the Mac (lack of third-party apps and games) might happen to the iPhone as well, so they gambled the profitability of the App Store away to encourage as many apps as possible. That was their choice.</p>
<p>Again, from Steve Jobs: &#8220;We keep 30% to pay for running the App Store.&#8221; Not a profit center. Not a business. Just to pay for running the store, so that the user experience for app discovery on the iPhone is second to none.</p>
<p>Today, we know that Apple has never planned well for free apps. You don&#8217;t need to look much further than their <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/143339/2009/10/appstorepurchasing.html">reversal of allowing in-app purchase in free apps</a> to see that they are making this stuff up as they go along.</p>
<p>When Steve Jobs said it, offering free apps for so little seemed almost foolish, like Apple was compensating for the high 30% by giving <em>too</em> good a deal to free apps. Why not charge some hosting fee? Or why not give up exclusive distribution and let free apps be installed directly by the user without forcing everything through the App Store? Unlimited bandwidth, promotion in the store, and everything else just for the $99 dev program fee was a pretty good deal.</p>
<p>And now I wonder if Apple hasn&#8217;t been backpedaling ever since, trying to make up for that mistake: free apps are a burden. iAd was the first correction, because a share of revenue from free apps was going to Google instead of Apple. In-app purchase is the next correction, because real value can be delivered in a free app with transactions handled elsewhere.</p>
<p>Apple can&#8217;t accept a future in which too many apps are technically free &mdash; something that has already happened on Android &mdash; unless they are also taking a cut when money changes hands outside of app download.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.appleoutsider.com/2011/02/22/omgiapbbq/">Matt Drance clearly spotted the loophole</a> that forces Apple to be so strict with in-app rules:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;30% to Apple across the board &mdash; app sales, IAP, and now subscriptions &mdash; is consistent, clear, and uncheatable. That cheating bit is significant: a 10% commission for subscriptions, for example, would see developers adopting the subscription system en masse so they could keep more money. Apps that were once $2.99 would suddenly be asking for installments like late-night infomercials.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple is trapped by their original decision to shoulder the cost of free apps. They encouraged free apps and now they&#8217;ve got one band-aid on top of another &mdash; advertisements, in-app purchase, subscriptions &mdash; all trying to make free apps work for the App Store bottom line. These changes make developers nervous because all the power lies with Apple.</p>
<p>Free apps and the problem of exclusive distribution are linked. Get rid of free apps, and the store can support itself naturally. Get rid of exclusive distribution, and Apple can be more creative about charging developers who do want to participate in the App Store. If Amazon isn&#8217;t happy with Apple&#8217;s terms, users can install the Kindle app outside the store and it doesn&#8217;t cost Apple anything to maintain.</p>
<p>Apple, want to charge 30%? Go for it. Want to make the submission rules more strict? Fine. Want to adjust how you run the App Store to reflect what&#8217;s happening in the market? No problem. Just give developers an out. We are going to be back here year after year with the latest controversy until exclusive app distribution is fixed.</p>

			<p>I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about the iPad 2. Yes, &#8220;most of it was expected&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/status/42597189645639680, but faster and more memory is exactly what the iPad needs. I&#8217;ll be getting it on day 1 and can&#8217;t wait to give Tweet Library a try on the new hardware.</p>
<p>During the announcement I collected 70 tweets that I thought captured the event. You can &#8220;view them on tweetlibrary.com&#8221;:http://tweetlibrary.com/manton/ipad2event.</p>
<p>Speaking of Tweet Library, Apple just approved version 1.2.2. It fixes a handful of bugs and adds a few new things, like block and report spam, for those of you using it as your main Twitter client. Check out the &#8220;full release notes&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/releasenotes/ or view it &#8220;in the App Store&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweet-library/id365768793?mt=8.</p>

			<p>I hadn&#8217;t yet read &#8220;Neven Mrgan&#8217;s post&#8221;:http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/3451376797/30 when I wrote &#8220;my own&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/02/30_of_the.html yesterday, but he strikes one of the same themes I closed with:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But with this 30% thing, the 30% I&#8217;m really interested in is, will Apple eventually see 30% of its revenue come from various cuts, percentages, deals, and obligations? If so, that means a different focus for the company &mdash; a focus on things and people farther removed from me and you. And that makes me a bit bummed out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, neither of us is filling in for Steve Jobs, and Apple <em>can</em> do anything they want within the law. But what Neven captures so well here is that many of us hold Apple to a higher standard because Apple has a history of creating great things. This 30% business model doesn&#8217;t seem to have any place in that history.</p>
