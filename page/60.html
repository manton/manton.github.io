			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In the 2000 presidential election, Gore was behind in all the national polls before election day. I remember that night, listening to the radio in a fast food drive-in lane when NPR called Pennsylvania for Gore. I cheered to no one in particular, because it was the first confirmation that Gore could win.</p>
<p>If you believe the polls today, Bush has a few point lead, and the election will be decided in a handful of battleground states. I no longer believe the polls, except as an indicator for overall trends. Kerry will win by a solid margin. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
<p><b><i>Youth</i></b></p>
<p>Last Monday morning I was in the Austin airport waiting to catch a flight, watching the local news. They were covering University of Texas students who had stayed up all night outside the early voting location on campus to vote. They were all Kerry supporters.</p>
<p>Now, a week later, the local news is reporting some numbers from UT. There are <i>three times</i> the number of early voters on campus compared to 2000. For the most part these voters are not even included in polls because they all use cell phones as their primary number.</p>
<p><b><i>Republicans</i></b></p>
<p>It takes a lot to abandon years of straight-party voting, but it&rsquo;s happening this year. Sometimes it takes enormous respect for the candidate (such as Democrats who could easily vote for John McCain). This year it&rsquo;s the opposite: Republicans are baffled by Bush&rsquo;s misjudgments in war and his abandonment of fiscal conservatism.</p>
<p>Also see: <a href="http://www.errolmorris.com/html/election04/election04_main.html">Republican switcher ads</a></p>
<p><b><i>The undecided</i></b></p>
<p>Apparently there is a large percentage of voters who are just confused about how politics work in this country. Personality means more to them than terms like liberal and conservative. Instead, there are usually a few key issues that turn these voters to any one candidate. Two of those issues this year are the economy (lean to Kerry) and fear (lean to Bush).</p>
<p>The debates help people choose, and Kerry outperformed Bush in all three. Kerry wasn&rsquo;t totally immune to criticism, though. The flip-flop nonsense tends to stick because there is a little bit of truth to it (ignoring for the moment that Bush has more than his fair share of major policy reversals). <a href="http://mathewgross.com/blog/archives/000686.html">Mathew Gross pointed</a> to a &lt;a href=&#8221;http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101041004-702123,00.html</p>
<p>&#8220;>Time Magazine article</a> second-guessing the outcome in the Democratic primaries:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Democratic voters should stick to their day jobs. With just five weeks until Election Day, there&rsquo;s reason to believe they guessed wrong &mdash; that Dean would be doing better against Bush than Kerry is.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the scream, I still believe that Dean would have been a strong candidate. He distinguished himself from the other candidates by a real desire to effect change: even today, he is a powerful force for local and state-level candidates. He showed the Democrats how to win when they had lost their voice.</p>
<p>So there you have it. My prediction: Kerry by 3 percent nationally, with important wins in Florida, Colorado, and Pennsylvania giving him the electoral college. Record numbers of young voters.</p>

			<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/italk/">Griffin iTalk</a> earlier this week. Not entirely an impulse buy, but I did drive over to the local Apple Store instead of ordering online. I&rsquo;ve been wanting the ability to record on my iPod since I received my first generation one. I find myself walking and driving a lot lately, so it&rsquo;s a great way to record random thoughts while away from the computer. For personal use, not for broadcasting.</p>
<p>The quality is acceptable, but not what I&rsquo;d like it to be. I tried to record a lecture in a large auditorium, with poor results. Might try again with a better position, or even an external microphone.</p>
<p>The software interface is the expected Apple high standards. Plug the thing in and it works, nothing to install. Yes, that&rsquo;s right &mdash; Apple built recording software into all iPods (except the minis), knowing that only a very small fraction would have the hardware necessary to record. And that philosophy comes from the top. Here&rsquo;s what Steve had to say in an <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/oct2004/nf20041012_4018_db083.htm">interview with BusinessWeek</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because when you buy our products, and three months later you get stuck on something, you quickly figure out [how to get past it]. And you think, &lsquo;Wow, someone over there at Apple actually thought of this!&rsquo; And then three months later you try to do something you hadn&rsquo;t tried before, and it works, and you think &lsquo;Hey, they thought of that, too.&rsquo; And then six months later it happens again. There&rsquo;s almost no product in the world that you have that experience with, but you have it with a Mac. And you have it with an iPod.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Jon Udell frequently talks about audio techniques. I liked this section from today&rsquo;s blog post on <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/10/14.html#a1095">personal productivity</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;How many times have you heard this? &lsquo;Your call may be recorded in order to assure quality customer service.&rsquo; Lately I&rsquo;m starting to repeat the line back to them and then start recording on my end too. If you can pinpoint what an agent said on a previous call, you can alter the balance of power.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I bought a new gadget for myself. We&rsquo;ll have to see whether it ends up being useful or not.</p>

			<p>The death of Christopher Reeve will hit a lot of people pretty hard. He worked with so much determination to regain movement and he stayed optimistic. It&#8217;s an inspirational story, and it&#8217;s a shock that the story is now over. As my wife said, &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t supposed to die.&#8221; He vowed to walk again, and we believed it.</p>
<p>In the second presidential debate last week, Kerry brought up Reeve as an example of who we can help and why stem cell research could be so important. Here&#8217;s the quote, from the <a href="http://debates.org/pages/trans2004c.html">official debate transcript</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You know, I was at a forum with Michael J. Fox the other day in New Hampshire, who&#8217;s suffering from Parkinson&#8217;s, and he wants us to do stem cell, embryonic stem cell. And this fellow stood up, and he was quivering. His whole body was shaking from the nerve disease, the muscular disease that he had.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he said to me and to the whole hall, he said, &#8216;You know, don&#8217;t take away my hope, because my hope is what keeps me going.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chris Reeve is a friend of mine. Chris Reeve exercises every single day to keep those muscles alive for the day when he believes he can walk again, and I want him to walk again.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nancy Reagan, Ron Reagan, Michael J. Fox, and Christopher Reeve have done a lot of good as activists, because they are respected and admired by the public. But there are thousands more who are not well-known, and those people are equally worth fighting for.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s appropriate that Christopher Reeve, the man forever known as Superman, would fight so hard to overcome the limitations of his crippled, human body. Superman is an icon, not just an old comic. The idea speaks to a generation of kids who dream to be something more, and it&#8217;s the reason that that memorable scene in Iron Giant can bring an adult to tears.</p>

			<p>More Olympics this weekend. First the U.S. basketball team, ahead most of the game and playing well, then losing in the last few minutes. Next, the women&#8217;s marathon, the heartbreak for England&#8217;s Paula Radcliffe as she couldn&#8217;t finish the race after leading the runners for the first dozen miles, then the come-from-behind bronze metal finish for the U.S.&#8217;s Deena Kastor.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="http://a.wholelottanothing.org/archives.blah/007973">Matt Haughey wrote about the genetic lottery</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every sport favors genetics to some extent, but I&#8217;ve always discounted them and held that anyone of any shape could rise towards the top if they trained hard enough. But at the absolute upper reaches of a sport, falling outside the norm becomes a liability and when the margin of error grows thin, you&#8217;re going to fall behind the best.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I always think of Gattaca. Sure it&#8217;s fiction, but I think there&#8217;s some real truth to it &#8212; the power of the human spirit. The two brothers are far out in the water, and Anton asks Jerome how is he doing it, how can he swim further and do these great things when he is genetically inferior and all stats point to a heart that is long overdue for beating its last. The answer: &#8220;You wanted to know how I did it? That&#8217;s how I did it, Anton. I never saved anything for the swim back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Give it your all this week.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;But in the case of internet, web and net, a change in our house style was necessary to put into perspective what the internet is: another medium for delivering and receiving information. That it transformed human communication is beyond dispute. But no more so than moveable type did in its day. Or the radio. Or television.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a good thing. Years ago, I remember arguing quite passionately with People Who Had Some Kind of Related College Degree that &#8220;web&#8221; should not be capitalized. I lost that battle, and have since occasionally capitalized it myself, for conformity&#8217;s sake.</p>

Rather than stare at a stack of blank punched paper, I look at thumbnail drawings, think a little bit, and then come away with something like this image.</p>
<p>It has been said many times before, that animation is all about timing. Look no further than Flash web cartoons. More than half are crudely drawn and so limited as to make the Flintstones look like full animation. But when they work, it&#8217;s because the creator had some knack for timing, and pulled some small acting miracle out of the spacing, replaying and tweaking it again and again on the Flash timeline.</p>
<p>Traditional animators, by comparison, have it a little tougher. Some investment must be placed in the hand drawings before taking the stack of 50 or more sheets to pencil test under a video camera. So we scribble in the margins, plan it out, and hope for the best.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Saturday night was my 10-year high school reunion (more specifically the Anderson High School reunion class of 1994 from Austin, which I say only for Google&#8217;s reference, even if it dates me). As recent as two months ago I had considered not attending, but I ended up having a really good time, more than I ever thought I would. It was great to see everyone.</p>
<p>I took some pictures. Only a handful came out, so my apologies to everyone who will only remain a blurry image in my copy of iPhoto. Perhaps that&#8217;s for the best. But I&#8217;ve <a href="../images/gallery/reunion/index.html">posted the better ones here</a> with brief annotations for anyone who was at the event. Most of the time I forgot I had the camera with me. (Whoops.)</p>
<p>Luckily I didn&#8217;t show up alone, so the nervousness and &#8220;I don&#8217;t belong here&#8221; feeling that I was bracing for was diminished. Afterwards, though, came a sort of melancholy that I did not expect, a vague emotional conflict between the few folks I&#8217;ll see again and the larger number that I probably won&#8217;t. Five minutes of conversation over drinks is not an adequate way to catch up on 10 years. Truthfully, I share more in common with some of them now than I do the people I see on a more regular basis. All Sunday I found myself thinking about it, and just sort of marveling at how our lives diverge and then criss-cross again, and how that same web is played out on a larger scale for everyone we meet.</p>

			<p>The private park behind our house is owned by a local church, and they aren&#8217;t afraid to spend money on fireworks every year. Last week was probably the best show yet. We brought some chairs out to the sidewalk to get a good view over our trees. Our neighbors were doing hotdogs and marshmallows in their front yard and also provided sparklers. Fun times.</p>
<p>I took some cheap video with my digital camera. Some frames from it are below. It was so close overhead that the paper remnants from the fireworks were falling in the street and in the yard.</p>

			<p>Yesterday I finally arrived back in Austin after 8 days in California. Last weekend started off with a trip to Los Angeles, where I met up with my old friend Justin and attended &#8220;2D Expo&#8221;, a conference sponsored by <a href="http://www.asifa-hollywood.org/">ASIFA-Hollywood</a> for traditional animators. The conference was great, and I left feeling pretty energized. There is an opportunity right now for traditional animation to leave its Disney roots and break new ground. I met some great people and had fun talking about the industry and what comes next. Hope to be back to the LA area one of these days.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, Justin picked me up from Burbank and we drove north on highway 1, which hugs the coastline all the way to San Francisco. We stopped at a few random scenic points, a nice restaurant overlooking the water, and at Big Sur. A healthy couple mile walk through Chinatown and dinner at Fisherman&#8217;s Wharf rounded out the evening.</p>
<p><center><img src="../images/2004/highway_1.jpg" width="400" height="239" alt="Highway 1" border="1"></center></p>
<p>Monday through Friday was Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">World Wide Developer Conference</a>. At work we sent 5 people, so we had pretty good coverage of all the interesting sessions. As usual the keynote was not to be missed. I&#8217;ve yet to see a Steve Jobs&#8217; demo that wasn&#8217;t effective. The first time I saw him was the Macworld Expo after he came back to Apple (but before he took over), and he even managed to make a NeXTSTEP demo look impressive. Contrary to what many people believed at the introduction to Mac OS X, Apple&#8217;s new OS is not just NeXT-based; it&#8217;s about a third NeXT, a third classic Mac OS, and a third something entirely new. That last third really shines in <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/">Tiger</a>.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;ve routinely been working past midnight the last couple of weeks as we make a final push to get our software finished. Although it&#8217;s just coincidence that we usually ship right before WWDC, it reminds me of the old days of trying to get betas ready to demo before Macworld Expo or one of the other yearly conferences.</p>
<p>I took a break from that on Sunday, my third Father&#8217;s Day. Big breakfast with the family, mowing the lawn with some iPod tunes, putting together a baby crib, lunch, then headed down to the Austin Sketch Group meeting and talked animated films and art while sipping a chocolate coffee drink which had entirely too much caffeine in it. <a href="http://www.flatblackfilms.com/">Bob Sabiston</a> came by to recruit folks for Richard Linklater&#8217;s upcoming film, A Scanner Darkly (based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679736654/mantonorg">Philip K. Dick book</a>). It will employ the same rotoscope technique used for <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/waking_life.html">Waking Life</a>, but perhaps favoring a more consistent style rather than the individual inventiveness of that previous film. Should be fun to see the result, and in the wake of Shrek 2 box office numbers it&#8217;s good to see some investment in creative, lower-budget animated films.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last week Apple released the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/AppleSWDesign/">Apple Software Design Guidelines document</a>. I&#8217;ve only just skimmed it, but it looks like the best document from Apple in years.</p>
<p>Take this little bit of advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When saving files of your own document types, include a file type, creator type, and filename extension for your file. It is best to include all three of these identifiers to ensure maximum compatibility with other platforms.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, yeah. Finally some solid, practical recommendations from Apple that take into account the whole system, not a narrow set of APIs.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago I read the Microsoft article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnwui/html/iuiguidelines.asp?frame=true">&#8220;Inductive User Interface Guidelines&#8221;</a>. The principles from the document showed up extensively in Windows XP and will be even more prevalent in Longhorn as Microsoft attempts to cloud the difference between web and traditional applications. It struck me as an interesting approach, one that clearly has benefits for some types of users and some applications. I wrote about it a little last year in a post called <a href="../2003/02/inductive_vs.html">&#8220;Inductive vs rich user interface design&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>Now take that feedback in the context of <a href="http://www.asktog.com/basics/firstPrinciples.html">this article from AskTog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Usability and learnability are not mutually exclusive. First, decide which is the most important; then attack both with vigor. Ease of learning automatically coming at the expense of ease of use is a myth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple has almost completely ignored the user interface principles that Microsoft is pushing. Here&#8217;s a quote from the new Apple design guidelines document:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Allow the user, not the computer, to initiate and control actions. Some applications attempt to assist the user by offering only those alternatives deemed good for the user or by protecting the user from having to make detailed decisions. This approach mistakenly puts the computer, not the user, in control.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Apple document doesn&#8217;t contain anything &#8220;new&#8221;, but it&#8217;s a great set of principles and suggestions gathered from other sources and put in a succinct format. The new Apple is not without it&#8217;s recent user interface stumbles, but it&#8217;s nice to know that overall they have the best grasp of the big design picture that they&#8217;ve ever had.</p>

			<p>If you&#8217;d have asked me last week whether I would see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0350028/">Raising Helen</a> on opening night, I&#8217;d have given you a puzzled look and maybe said something about looking forward to Harry Potter. But that was before I realized that the short film <a href="http://www.animationartconservation.com/lorenzo.html">Lorenzo</a> will be shown before that new Kate Hudson flick.</p>
<p>Lorenzo makes extensive use of computers but is still a traditionally animated film. I was immediately captured by the visuals of this film since I first saw stills and clips from it. In the age of Pepsi commercials, trailers, and &#8220;The Twenty&#8221;, theatrical short films are all but dead. I jump at the chance to see one, especially one as visually innovative as Lorenzo.</p>
<p>A technical summary of the animation process for Lorenzo can be found in this <a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~mario/npr/projects/sigg03/lec8/hand_1.pdf">PDF from a Siggraph lecture</a>.

			<p>I&#8217;m listening to track 3 of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000095J94/mantonorg">Finding Nemo soundtrack</a> on repeat. Something very soothing about that opening music.</p>
<p>I finally got to watch the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001IN0MQ/mantonorg">Triplets of Belleville DVD</a> special features, and I only wish there was more (full director&#8217;s commentary would be nice). When I left the theater last month, there was no question in my mind but that Sylvain Chomet in a brilliant artist and director. The death of 2d animation in Hollywood is a blessing in disguise. Small, modest-budget, completely artist-driven productions could flourish right now. New and different stories could be successful in a way that was impossible when Disney owned the screen in the 1990s.</p>
<p>From an <a href="http://www.animwatch.com/Feature04-Triplets.shtml">AnimWatch interview with Evgeni Tomov</a>, the Triplets of Belleville art director:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Animation has its charm and qualities. It delivers different aesthetic and emotional experience. It is not just about telling a story the fastest and the cheapest way. The Triplets would have not been nearly as interesting and unique if it was a live action film. The hand made, drawn feel that comes from the screen, the stylization of the characters (you can not find actors with this kind of bizarre physics) resonate quite well with the equally bizarre story we are witnessing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Think big and keep drawing.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.flowdelic.org/">Mason Hale</a> of frog design started a weblog last week, and already he&#8217;s got some great posts and discussion. Mason and I worked together around 1995. You know, back when the Internet was still fun.</p>
<p>At the time, Mason had been building a CGI framework inside Frontier. This coincided with Frontier&#8217;s time as a free application and helped jump start Dave Winer&#8217;s push to build Internet-related applications around Frontier. I built a number of web applications in Frontier, wrote some <a href="../archive/idiom/mactivity_presentation/index.html">cool un-shipped software</a> that used an embedded Frontier database, and even helped host and maintain the Frontier-Talk mailing list for a time. After a few years, Frontier and I went our separate ways. (Bonus in the previous link: The web server plug-in mentioned in the slides from 1996 was called Rendezvous.)</p>
<p>Yesterday <a href="http://archive.scripting.com/2004/05/17#asGoodATimeAsAny">Dave Winer announced</a> that the Frontier kernel&#8217;s source code will be released for the first time. This is a really interesting move and, like all good ideas, probably could have had more of an impact if done earlier. AppleScript dominates desktop automation now, but a focused set of Frontier tools could still be very useful. I don&#8217;t think this effort will fizzle like the <a href="http://macbird.userland.com/">MacBird release</a> did, in part because Frontier is already Carbonized (see <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2842">Brent&#8217;s comments about that</a>) and in use by developers.</p>
<p>Mason and I still bump into each other every once in a while, but now it&#8217;s more as parents than as geeks. To Dave, Mason, Brent, <a href="http://wmf.editthispage.com/">Wes</a>, and everyone else that contributed to Frontier&#8217;s history: congrats.</p>

			<p>Not 5 minutes after I posted <a href="../2004/05/the_itunes.html">yesterday&#8217;s iTunes piece</a>, <a href="http://www.irelan.net/becoming/">Ryan</a> tells me I&#8217;m asking for too much. &#8220;My fear is that too many features will render iTunes a useless and unusable app,&#8221; he writes, and he&#8217;s absolutely right to be concerned.</p>
<p>I will admit that my list contains some less-than-great ideas, only loosely organized around the idea of discovering new music (something I&#8217;ve been trying to do lately). I do think RSS support would be interesting, though, because it would allow iMix-like functionality but distributed across anyone&#8217;s web site and created using any software.</p>
<p>The important point, I guess, is that iTunes still has room to grow, and that&#8217;s not by accident. Smart Playlists and Party Shuffle are two examples of great features that fit well inside the existing interface.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://otterlearn.typepad.com/blogkathleen/2004/05/my_itunes_playl.html">Kathleen wants something similar with RSS</a>, but sort of the other way around: RSS generated from the published iMixes.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s no secret that iTunes is one of Apple&#8217;s best apps. Of all the iApps, iTunes remains the only one I have no critical feature requests for. With version 4.5, Apple adds to what was already a solid app, and they continue to do so in a way that fits well inside the two foundation pieces they&#8217;ve created: the basic music library interface and the iTunes Music Store.</p>
<p>I noticed the other day that they now have trailers and music videos inside of iTunes. The investment they made in the old <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/">trailers site</a> was initially just to showcase QuickTime, but it ties perfectly in with the store soundtrack collection.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next? Here are some more random ideas for the iTunes platform:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Movie showtimes.</b> Can they give this a good/fast UI? Sherlock 2 isn&#8217;t so bad, but I never have the app running. iTunes is always there.</li>
<li><b>Music magazine.</b> Both original articles and syndicated articles from major magazines and even weblogs.</li>
<li><b>RSS reader.</b> What app couldn&#8217;t use a little RSS? I&#8217;d like music feeds (which <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/MRSS/rssGenerator">Apple already provides</a>) directly in iTunes instead of NetNewsWire. Double-click a news item to hear a song preview, of course.</li>
<li><b>Recommendations from library.</b> This has been suggested before: An option to feed local playlists to iTMS servers to improve recommendations. This is different than publicly shared iMixes, but maybe could be an extension of that feature.</li>
<li><b>Amazon integration for CDs.</b> Not all music is available in iTMS. I&#8217;d like a simple Amazon interface off of their search results, for those times I can&#8217;t find what I&#8217;m looking for in iTMS.</li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/blog/2004-04-14.22:22">&#8220;What if Mail.app were like iTunes?&#8221;</a>, Rui Carmo rattles off a dozen features that would be nice in Mail, but he only hints at the real question. What makes iTunes such a great app? Clearly some of it is interface design. Then there&#8217;s the incredible speed, which also affects usability. iTunes is the only iApp still written in Carbon, is that a relevant distinction? Does iTunes (because of the music store and iPod) simply get more resources within Apple? Maybe. But even with all of these things, you can&#8217;t continue to build and ship a great app without a smart team and tight integration between related groups (UI, WebObjects, etc), and ultimately I think that&#8217;s what makes any product a success.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see what the iTunes folks come up with for 5.0.</p>

			<p>There has been a fascinating discussion among information architects and web designers about the usefulness of breadcrumb trails. Mark Hurst of Good Experience talks about <a href="http://www.goodexperience.com/columns/04/0325.pp.html">the page paradigm</a>, Peter Merholz <a href="http://www.peterme.com/archives/000296.html">mostly disagrees</a>, and Christine Wodtke <a href="http://www.eleganthack.com/archives/003852.html">offers her two cents</a>. Here&#8217;s part of what Steve Krug had to say about the topic in his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789723107/mantonorg">&#8220;Don&#8217;t Make Me Think&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For most sites, I don&#8217;t think Breadcrumbs <i>alone</i> are a good navigation scheme. They&#8217;re not a good replacement for showing at least the top two layers of the hierarchy, because they don&#8217;t reveal enough. They give you a view, but it&#8217;s like a view with blinders. It&#8217;s not that you can&#8217;t make your way around using just Breadcrumbs. It&#8217;s that they&#8217;re not a good way to <i>present</i> most sites.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get my wrong. Done right, Breadcrumbs are self-explanatory, they don&#8217;t take up much room, and they provide a convenient, consistent way to do two of the things you need to do most often: back up a level or go Home.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark might argue that &#8220;back up a level&#8221; is more often accomplished with the browser&#8217;s back button, eliminating one of the points above. (Although the book actually has a whole chapter on this stuff, to be fair to Mr. Krug.)</p>
<p>Yesterday, Andrei Herasimchuk wrote that <a href="http://www.designbyfire.com/000075.html">navigation doesn&#8217;t actually exist</a>. Instead, he argues, there are only ways of finding things, and some of them have nothing to do with conveying the user&#8217;s position. He does a good job of framing the different needs of large collections of web pages vs. web applications. Clearly there is a &#8220;where am I&#8221; to hierarchical sets of data. Users feel as if they are moving between pages that have relationships, and making those relationships clear in the interface (via category lists or breadcrumb trials) minimizes how much the user is required to think about where they are, and how to get someplace else.</p>
<p>Amazon, on the other hand, is a web application. While there are clear navigation elements (browsing category pages, or using the primary navigation to jump between books and DVDs), most of the time the user doesn&#8217;t get lost because they aren&#8217;t moving. Instead of saying &#8220;I am on the search results page&#8221;, they might say &#8220;I am searching for a book&#8221;. The experience is dominated with tasks: &#8220;I&#8217;m adding something to my shopping cart&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m buying this book&#8221;, &#8220;I&#8217;m changing my credit card information.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or maybe they are just randomly clicking on featured products. It all feels effortless to the user because Amazon has done such a great job with their search and recommendation system.</p>
<p>Brenda Laurel gave an interesting keynote address at SXSW Interactive this year, one which I have trouble summarizing in any meaningful way, and thankfully has nothing to do with this discussion. But a dozen years earlier, she edited a compilation of essays on user interface design from the perspective of the teams at Apple. The book is called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201517973/mantonorg">&#8220;The Art of Human-Computer Interface Design&#8221;</a>, and one essay by Abigail Sellen and Anne Nicol hits to the heart of this issue of navigation. Here&#8217;s a snippet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The number of questions concerning navigation is very much application-dependent. Typically they arise most frequently with applications that are structurally complex and that contain a large amount of information. Hypertext-based software is one obvious example; hierarchically structured systems are another. Users tend to make heavy use of spacial metaphors: they report feeling &#8216;lost,&#8217; speak of going &#8216;up&#8217; and &#8216;down&#8217; between levels or going &#8216;in&#8217; and &#8216;out&#8217; of situations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users often spontaneously construct spacial mental models or mental &#8216;maps&#8217; in order to move easily from one context to another. This has obvious implications for design. Reducing the memory lead on the user is one benefit of making these mental &#8216;maps&#8217; explicit. Users can refer to the map instead of trying to retrieve information from memory to tell them &#8216;where they are.&#8217; Another benefit is that a map can form the basis of a mental model on which the user relies to infer how to get from point A to point B without having to keep in mind a set of procedures for navigation. Thus, by exploiting spatial metaphors and allowing the user to make the inference, designers can help users avoid having to ask the question, &#8216;How do I get from point A to point B?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good points to think about. Instead of attempting to wrap this up with some insightful comment, I&#8217;m going to go build stuff.</p>
