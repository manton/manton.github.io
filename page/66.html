				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve been using &#8220;Ta-da List&#8221;:http://www.tadalist.com/ for the last couple of years for all my to-do lists. I have about 100 lists and love the speed of adding new items and some of the subtle smarts it applies to sorting recent lists and cleaning up completed ones.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve been on the lookout for a desktop app. OmniOutliner has become a bit bloated and all the Getting Things Done apps seem so structured. Along comes &#8220;TaskPaper&#8221;:http://hogbaysoftware.com/projects/taskpaper today and there&#8217;s a lot to like. The plain text file format is refreshing and nicely open.</p>
<p>I wrote a Ruby script to export all my lists from Ta-da into TaskPaper so that I can give it a proper workout. It makes a new document (with a single project) for each list it finds. Make sure to install &#8220;Hpricot&#8221;:http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/ first &#8212; there&#8217;s no official Ta-da List API so we need to parse HTML a little.</p>
<p>Download: &#8220;tadalist_taskpaper.rb&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/software/scripts/tadalist_taskpaper.rb</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the file in your favorite text editor and change TADALIST_HOST to whatever your account is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure Safari is running and you have logged into Ta-da. The script reads the cookie value from Safari&#8217;s Cookies.plist so that it doesn&#8217;t need to simulate a real sign-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run from the command line. It will create the new files in the current directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will see short status messages for what it is doing. It&#8217;s broken if there are any Ruby exceptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

			<p>From time to time on the &#8220;MacSB list&#8221;:http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/macsb people ask about the value of localization and what percentage of sales come from foreign customers. Since day 1 of &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ I&#8217;ve always been surprised at how many sales are from Europe. At times it felt as if over half of sales were outside the United States, so I finally ran the numbers to know for sure.</p>
<p>My homegrown customer database doesn&#8217;t actually include the physical address, so I grabbed the last 500 sales from PayPal and wrote a quick script to group the countries. Here&#8217;s the chart:</p>
<p><img src="../images/2007/sales_chart_countries.gif" border="0" height="265" width="341" alt="Wii Transfer countries chart" /></p>
<p>The United States represents just over half. If you add up the other English-speaking countries, it hits 70%. Still, this is a purely English-only piece of software. I&#8217;ve resisted the push to localize until I feel the codebase is better prepared for it, and the UI more stable.</p>
<p>At &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ last year I wrote a custom Rails web app to manage localization resources for both the Mac and Windows products and deal with the outsource translators, and the takeaway from that experience was definitely to go slowly. It&#8217;s easy to end up with a foreign language version that makes compromises and is potentially less useful to customers than the English version. Depending on the size of the product, localization could take weeks or months, time that might be better spent adding features.</p>
<p>Back to the real stats. Why are the foreign numbers so high? I think the weak dollar combined with an already relatively inexpensive price makes Wii Transfer even more of an impulse buy in Europe.</p>

			<p>Ignore that this post is a week late. While I was out sick last week there was a great discussion across blogs about email clients, starting with &#8220;Brent Simmons&#8221;:http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3425 and then to &#8220;Paul Kafasis&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Article/Rise-of-the-OS-2007-07-05-12-00.html while passing through several good blogs in between.</p>
<p>Some of my additional gripes about Mail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text editor is terrible for text-only email, especially when quoting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UI refresh glitches with mailbox unread counts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sluggish showing new smart folders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search is not powerful enough without making smart folders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overall stability problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I started writing an email client last year and worked on it in my spare time for a couple of months before abandoning it. It added a few new twists that other clients don&#8217;t have, including a server component in an attempt to embrace the benefits of both Gmail (access anywhere, automatic sync) and a native Mac client (better UI). No one I described it to thought they needed it, and I gave up before the UI was polished enough to actually show. Turns out the server piece was too complex and no matter how I juggled the numbers, it just didn&#8217;t seem a profitable endeavor.</p>
<p>The recent discussions really make we want to take some of the core pieces (great performance for huge amounts of mail and a tag-based filing system), rebuild it on top of IMAP instead of my custom web services gateway, and see what happens. But I probably won&#8217;t. Email clients are a tricky thing to get right, and I don&#8217;t have time right now to make it perfect.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that there is a market waiting for a great email client. You don&#8217;t need to compete with Mail.app, you just have to appeal to anyone who has been burned by an email client before. People who are serious about email.</p>

			<p>That&#8217;s the way I described the iPhone to anyone I showed it off to over the weekend. The thing is amazing. Easily the most advanced and beautiful UI that we have ever seen on a portable device.</p>
<p>I waited outside the Apple Store most of Friday to get an iPhone, and it contrasted very favorable with &#8220;my experience camping out for the Wii&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2006/11/nintendo_wii_purchase.html. The 6pm sale time decision was a smart one. It turns out waiting in line all day wasn&#8217;t necessary, but for anyone who had to have one on day 1 it was the safest choice, and it makes for a fun community. I ran into a bunch of people I knew and met new folks as well. Enjoyed catching up with &#8220;Donna Kidwell&#8221;:http://www.gamermom.com/ and had a chance to chat at length with Jeremy Derr of &#8220;Barton Springs Software&#8221;:http://www.bssware.com/.</p>
<p>&#8220;Damon YouTubed the line&#8221;:http://damonclinkscales.com/past/iphone-line-at-the-apple-store-the-domain/ in the early afternoon and by 6pm the line was roughly 250 people. We were in the low 40s and were in and out of the Apple Store in 15 minutes. They ran a great launch. Also a nice assortment of free water, tea, pizza, and coffee from both Apple and surrounding businesses. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a shot of me&#8221;:http://flickr.com/photos/digitalnomad/697023122/ from Damon&#8217;s Flickr stream.</p>

<p>Here are my posts to Twitter throughout the day, which also show part of the story:</p>
<p><em>6:34am:</em> Good morning iPhone Day! Weather forecast in Austin for today: 40% chance of showers and storms.</p>
<p><em>10:15am:</em> It&#8217;s only 10am but already realized I need to go to Plan B. Bribe friends already in line to use their 2nd iPhone purchase.</p>
<p><em>11:09am:</em> Change of plans. Heading to the Apple Store now to join in the line-waiting fun. Will it be too late?&#8221;</p>
<p><em>12:26pm:</em> I expected rain, but that seems unlikely. It&#8217;s hot like a real Austin summer here in the iPhone line.</p>
<p><em>2:32pm:</em> Hanging out in The Line with Jeremy of Barton Springs Software and @damon. Apple Store is closed. Had some lunch and a Starbucks soy latte.</p>
<p><em>4:03pm:</em> 2 hours left. We can redeem our free Starbucks coffee coupons now. Excited! (About the iPhone. Not the coffee.)</p>
<p><em>6:30pm:</em> Got my iPhone.</p>
<p><em>7:35pm:</em> Activation will have to wait. Ratatouille.</p>
<p><em>8:18pm:</em> Movies all sold out. Pre-activation dinner at Kerby Lane instead.</p>
<p><em>9:53pm:</em> Activation took less than a minute. Also, no plan choice. Just $20 added on to what I already pay, I guess.</p>
<p>Other reviews around the web:</p>
<p>&#8220;Matt Haughey&#8221;:http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2007/07/01/24-hours-with-the-iphone-my-dream-mini-computer/: &#8220;So in conclusion, the iPhone is nice from start to finish, but Safari is really the thing that turns it from a phone into a mini-laptop. Once I get more used to two-thumb typing, the last limitations that keep it from feeling like a real computer will be gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott Stevenson&#8221;:http://theocacao.com/document.page/488: &#8220;I usually don&#8217;t get too into pop culture events, but this is different. The Mac is going mainstream in a big way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ryan Irelan&#8221;:http://www.ryanirelan.com/past/2007/07/01/apple-iphone-brilliant-device-horrendous-activation/: &#8220;I probably tried out the emergency call slider three dozen times. I wonder if anyone actually called 911 because their phone wasn&#8217;t activating quickly enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Steven Frank&#8221;:http://stevenf.com/2007/07/the_official_stevenf_iphone_review.php: &#8220;Best phone ever. And given the rest of the industry&#8217;s generally pervasive cluelessness about pretty much everything, I don&#8217;t expect it to be surpassed by anything until the iPhone 2.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;John Gruber&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2007/06/iphone_first_impressions: &#8220;Overall day one impression: the iPhone is 95 percent amazing, 5 percent maddening. I&#8217;m just blown away by how nice it is &#8211; very thoughtful UI design and outstanding engineering.&#8221;</p>

			<p>I finally released &#8220;Wii Transfer 2.3&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ late last night. This is the version I demoed in &#8220;my interview with The Unofficial Apple Weblog&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/18/video-wii-transfer/. The most notable changes are AAC support, an improved music player interface, and better use of the Wii remote buttons.</p>
<p>This release sports a new icon, designed by Jordan Langille of &#8220;OneToad.com&#8221;:http://www.onetoad.com/. As much as I enjoy tinkering with Photoshop and Illustrator, I knew I didn&#8217;t have time to do a quality icon. I wanted something fun that still captured a part of the original icon, and this concept has really grown on me since it was finished almost 2 months ago.</p>
<p>I also took this opportunity to refresh the &#8220;Riverfold web site&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ design a little. Just don&#8217;t tell anyone that it still uses HTML tables.</p>

			<p><img src="../images/2007/moof_beer.jpg" alt="Moof" width="150" height="265" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="6" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /> Along with most of our house, my office is packed up and ready to move this week. The photo to the right is of one of the handful of items in a box labeled &#8220;Manton&#8217;s desk,&#8221; or, if someone else had her way, &#8220;Random junk Manton saves to remember the past but which should really be in the trash can.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unopened Moof beer from WWDC 1996, my first WWDC. At 20 I was too young to drink, but I probably would have saved it anyway. That was back when Apple gave you cool stuff and not just another cheap laptop bag.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s WWDC will probably go down as one of my favorites. The keynote was a bit dull, but it was offset by the reality that Leopard is a mature and usable system. I have been running all my primary apps off of it since last week, including Mail.app, NetNewsWire 3.0, and Xcode.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t place the feeling at the time, but now I realize that last week&#8217;s sessions were, in a way, relaxing. There was no sense of urgency. Most of the sessions I attended were practical, full of hands-on advice for preparing for Leopard and many applicable to Tiger development as well. I got a lot out of the week, and when I decided to skip out on Friday it didn&#8217;t feel like the world would come crashing down because of it.</p>
<p><img src="../images/2007/james_morrison.jpg" alt="James Morrison" width="300" height="226" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /> Other highlights of WWDC 2007 were away from the sessions: walking Chinatown with &#8220;Willie&#8221;:http://willie.tumblr.com/ on Sunday in search of the illusive bakery item; hitting the &#8220;SF Mac Indie party&#8221;:http://sfmacindie.com/ that night and hanging out with fellow developers afterwards; Buzz Andersen&#8217;s party Monday, catching up with &#8220;Lane&#8221;:http://www.monstro.com/ and the host; the &#8220;Dan Benjamin&#8221;:http://www.hivelogic.com/ annual breakfast; Apple &#8220;Design Awards&#8221;:http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/ada/ on Tuesday, which had a record number of wins for <em>apps I&#8217;ve actually used</em>; accidentally walking into a James Morrison concert at the Apple Store (left photo); being interviewed by Scott McNulty of &#8220;TUAW&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/, though I secretly hope they will decide not to air it; enjoying great Italian with the &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ team on Wednesday before catching the tail end of &#8220;CocoaHeads&#8221;:http://theocacao.com/document.page/480; plus the Apple Bash and more drinks and discussion Thursday night.</p>
<p>Like at &#8220;SXSW earlier this year&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/03/twitterconf.html, Twitter proves both cool and useful. I was lucky enough to meet many of the people on my Twitter friends list for the first time last week.</p>
<p>Of course it wasn&#8217;t all fun and games. I sifted through more legitimate Bookshelf bug reports than usual; I was exhausted pretty much every day; and there were a couple developers I had hoped to seek out that I just never made the time to.</p>
<p>All in all, though, a good week and now I&#8217;m ready to get back to coding.</p>

			<p>Today is a good day to release software. &#8220;MarsEdit gets a nice update&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/346/marsedit-12-growl-picasa-and-vox and &#8220;NetNewsWire 3.0&#8221;:http://ranchero.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=1646 ships. At VitalSource we also just released &#8220;Bookshelf 4.6&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/index/bookshelf today, which lays the foundation for media-rich textbooks and adds a highlighter rating UI for any subscribed highlighters you have. This data will bubble up in a few places in the future to allow you to discover people and books, although for now it&#8217;s one-way.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a &#8220;short screencast of the rating interface&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/screencasts/2007/bookshelf_rating.mov (12 seconds, 700k). The star widget is a simple Cocoa control that hits a web service in the background. It was fun to write and surprisingly not very much code.</p>

			<p>Brent Simmons, from a &#8220;TUAW interview&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/05/5-questions-with-brent-simmons-creator-of-netnewswire/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One of the things I love about being a Mac developer is getting to meet the folks who make the apps I use. In a way, my /Applications folder is also my social network. Which is cool.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I never thought about it that way, but it&#8217;s definitely a great aspect of the Mac developer community. I hope to add a few more people to my /Applications social network next week at WWDC.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to a bunch of WWDCs now, but I&#8217;m particularly excited this year because it will be the first time I&#8217;ve attended as representing both a &#8220;large-ish company&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ and an &#8220;independent one-man shop&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/.</p>
<p>I will be carrying VitalSource business cards in my wallet, but I also hope to have a printed batch of Wii Transfer serial numbers to hand out. I know a lot of Mac developers have a Nintendo Wii and it&#8217;s a shame I haven&#8217;t given out more copies. If you have a Wii and see me (I look &#8220;something like this&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/me/), please get my attention so that I can correct this oversight.</p>

			<p>Since version 2.0, &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ has had a built-in web server for serving music and photos to the Nintendo Wii. The server was written in Cocoa and the code became very unwieldy as I continued to add features. Dozens of methods for processing different parts of the URL, and many if statements for conditionally branching based on the URL, splitting the URL parameters, and more.</p>
<p>The code looked something like this (only worse):</p>
<pre><code>

if (path startsWithSubstring:@"/albums") {

[self processAlbumsRequest:path];

}

else if (path startsWithSubstring:@"/artists") {

[self processArtistsRequest:path];

}

else {

// ...

}

(void) processAlbumsRequest:(NSString *)inPath

{

// split out the parameters and request extensions from the URL path

// ...

if ([e isEqualToString:"xml"]) {

// ...

}

else if ([e isEqualToString:"html"]) {

// ...

}

}

</code></pre>
<p>Multiply that times 10 for all the different URLs that Wii Transfer knows how to process, and you can see how it worked fine for a couple simple things, but quickly became a mess as I added features.</p>
<p>For the upcoming version 2.3, I redesigned most of the URLs to follow a common structure, patterned after the default URL syntax that Rails uses: /controller/action/id. Now, instead of if statements, I dynamically route the URL requests using NSSelectorFromString() and performSelector:withObject:.</p>
<p>Consider this code (as above, simplified from the real thing):</p>
<pre><code>

// extract the values from /controller/action/id URLs

NSArray* pieces = [[path stringByDeletingPathExtension] pathComponents];

NSString* controller = [pieces objectAtIndex:1];

NSString* action = [pieces objectAtIndex:2];

NSString* param_id = [pieces objectAtIndex:3];

// call a method named controller_action, passing it the id

NSString* sel_name = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@_%@:", controller, action];

SEL method = NSSelectorFromString (sel_name);

[self performSelector:method withObject:param_id];

</code></pre>
<p>Now if I need to invent a new URL, say &#8220;/tracks/play/1234.mp3&#8221;, all I have to do is write the implementation for that method:</p>
<pre><code>

- (void) tracks_play:(NSString *)inParamID

{

// ...

}

</code></pre>
<p>The web request calls through to this new method without any additional glue code, in this case passing &#8220;1234&#8221; in the single parameter.</p>
<p>(The underscored method signatures aren&#8217;t very Cocoa-ish, but this is actually a plus because I can quickly spot the chunk of the controller that processes a set of requests, and I like that they read just like the URLs. I&#8217;m also currently using a single controller instead of having separate controller objects for the different types of requests, but I may expand that later.)</p>
<p>This convention has also allowed me to simplify all the URLs that Wii Transfer uses. Other examples include &#8220;/covers/search/U2&#8221; or &#8220;/artists/show/5&#8221;. I&#8217;ve eliminated a bunch of code, and it fits nicely with how I serve application resources and the start of a HTML template system.</p>
<p>Could it be taken further? Sure. I remember in the Mac OS 9 days building a web interface for a product using only compiled AppleScript scripts stored in the resource fork. Lately, folks like &#8220;Gus Mueller&#8221;:http://gusmueller.com/blog/ and Adobe&#8217;s Lightroom team have been doing interesting things with &#8220;embedding Lua&#8221;:http://www.sqlabs.net/blog/2006/01/adobe-lightroom-and-lua.html. I don&#8217;t want that level of extensibility yet, but it seems like a logical next generation when I outgrow even this new web architecture in Wii Transfer.</p>

			<p>If you are wondering why I haven&#8217;t posted here in over a month, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been getting my writing fix &#8220;over on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton, in 140 characters or less a couple times a day. Still trying to figure out the best way to integrate that experience into this site. I also have the usual queue of blog post drafts that will roll out here when I have time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile&#8230;</p>
<p>A bunch of really interesting things hit today. Microsoft Surface (can&#8217;t wait for the multi-touch iPhone); iTunes Plus (already upgraded my songs); and YouTube on the Apple TV (welcome if unexpected).</p>
<p>I have actually been dreading the iTunes Plus announcement because I am behind in &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ development, and I had hoped to coincide version 2.3 with the DRM-free AAC files on iTunes. It should be ready for a private beta in a few days. (Want in on the beta? Just email <a href="mailto:support@riverfold.com">support@riverfold.com</a>.)</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s the YouTube feature that is really fascinating to me. I&#8217;ve long thought that Apple has all but given up on web video, somehow content to let Flash dominate. The Apple movie trailers site as the last pocket of QuickTime content isn&#8217;t quite good enough. Apple could have created something on the scale of YouTube but hooked into the iApps, .Mac, and built on QuickTime. Maybe even as an extension of the iTunes Store around video podcasts.</p>
<p>(The great thing about podcasts is that they are decentralized, but it makes it a little more difficult when you are trying to build a community. The iTunes Store also does a great job for discovery but nothing to help content creators. There is no one-step upload.)</p>
<p>The Apple TV announcement is weird because while on the surface it looks like a confirmation that Flash video wins, it might just be the first sign of Apple fighting back. Every video on YouTube will get the H.264 treatment. The web video revolution (of sorts) has been great, but the pieces are coming together for truly useful broadband video. Perhaps YouTube sees that they could be a major player not just for silly webcam videos but as an infrastructure for high quality distribution, with content in some categories that will rival the networks.</p>
<p>That future is especially believable the first time you sync up near-HD video podcasts to the Apple TV. It&#8217;s a great experience and definitely exceeded my expectations.</p>

			<p>Paul Graham thinks &#8220;Microsoft and desktop apps are dead&#8221;:http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Gmail also showed how much you could do with web-based software, if you took advantage of what later came to be called &#8216;Ajax.&#8217; And that was the second cause of Microsoft&#8217;s death: everyone can see the desktop is over. It now seems inevitable that applications will live on the web &#8212; not just email, but everything, right up to Photoshop. Even Microsoft sees that now.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s definitely off the mark with that statement. Luckily &#8220;Martin Pilkington has a counter-rant&#8221;:http://pilky.mcubedsw.com/index.php?/site/the_desktop_is_here_to_stay/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There seems to be a slightly delusional section of web developers who seem to believe that in a few years time all of our applications and data will be online, while our computers run little more than a browser. Of course this is complete bull.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As someone who builds both desktop software and web apps, I&#8217;m very much interested in what happens in the middle. Next generation Mac software in particular can mix local HTML interfaces, web services, and syncing with a traditional rich UI to build something that is the best of both offline and online worlds.</p>
<p>I had an interesting conversation with &#8220;Willie Abrams&#8221;:http://willie.tumblr.com/ the other day about why the Flickr UI is better than iPhoto, even if you take away all the social parts of Flickr. The reason is that Flickr introduces extra layouts specific to certain types of activities, such as the excellent calendar view for archives. Another example of a web app UI innovation is the Backpack reminder UI that &#8220;John Gruber recently wrote about&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2007/03/deal_with_it.</p>
<p>Web apps are usually able to iterate on features and interfaces much quicker than desktop software, but that doesn&#8217;t make web apps inherently better. Put another way, iCal sucks because it hasn&#8217;t been seriously updated in 5 years.</p>
<p>I have other thoughts on this topic, but already I&#8217;ve extended this blog post 3 paragraphs more than intended.</p>

			<p>After I &#8220;blogged last month&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/i_hate_domains.html about the very small number of domain names I own, I got some good feedback from people I respect. They basically said: &#8220;You&#8217;re an idiot. Domain names are cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the more I thought about it, the more they were right. So last week I made an offer to buy the wiitransfer.com domain from its current owner, and after just about 48 hours I had the domain and was updating Wii Transfer to use it. Now all registered users can use the simpler bookmark URL wiitransfer.com/username to point to their shared music.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also finally rolling out a bug fix update tonight (version 2.2.1, &#8220;available here&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/). The most important change is that some MP3s that would not play will now work. Some customers never saw this, but for some people a large percentage of their music library was unusable. It turned out to be that certain kinds of embedded cover album artwork in the MP3 would break the Flash player on the Wii. The work-around I used is to load the MP3 into memory and clear all its ID3 tags before sending it over the wire.</p>
<p>It feels good to be working on Wii Transfer again. The next version is already underway and should make a lot of people happy.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s been over a week since SXSW Interactive wrapped up, and I can&#8217;t bring myself to post anything interesting about it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I had a great time. But I missed more sessions than usual this year (I&#8217;m trying to ship software here!), skipped half the parties (Traci was sick all weekend), and I didn&#8217;t notice any big themes that unified the conference.</p>
<p>Except Twitter. Which just underscores that it is about the people, and what they are doing, and being inspired.</p>
<p>I had a great time meeting new folks and catching up with old acquaintances: talking independent Mac development with Buzz Andersen and Justin Miller; software pricing with John Gruber; Rails and cities with Jamie Stephens and Sergio Rabiela; bumping into old school Mac web guys Carl de Cordova, Raines Cohen, Bill Christensen, and Wes Felter; co-workers and former co-workers Damon Clinkscales and Ryan Irelan respectively; lunch in a pub as a storm came down with Austinites Ben and Sara Brumfield; seeing my old friend John Brauer from high school who needs to email me (hint!); and finally meeting Shaun Inman and a bunch of other people whose names I can&#8217;t recall at the moment and whose business cards are buried somewhere, but no one is quite sure where.</p>
<p>My only regret is that there were a few people I wanted to say hi to that I literally saw from a distance on the first day of the conference and then <em>never saw again</em>. Maybe they took the wrong escalator and are still trapped in the void of that 3rd floor.</p>
<p>Of all the kajillion SXSW posts that have come through my fresh not-even-a-beta copy of NetNewsWire, I liked &#8220;Peter Merholtz&#8217;s write-up&#8221;:http://www.peterme.com/?p=533 the best:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What I realized, and what I need to do if I return to SXSW, is that in order to enjoy what SXSW Interactive has become (and boy, has it changed since 1999) I have to take a more Zen-like approach, ignoring all the Things I Could Be Doing, and focus on simply getting the most out of whatever I Am Doing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Seeya next year.</p>

			<p>Ten minutes until midnight as I type this. I started this blog 5 years ago. There have been just 329 posts in those 5 years, but there are some good ones in there. One thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that over the years I&#8217;ve switched from collecting links and providing short commentary, to more thoughtful longer posts. I&#8217;m hoping in this next year to go back to more of the earlier style.</p>
<p>My weblog anniversary also means that &#8220;SXSW&#8221;:http://www.sxsw.com/ is starting. I don&#8217;t plan to blog this weekend, but will instead be updating through &#8220;my Twitter account&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton. To be honest I&#8217;m not sure what to expect from this year&#8217;s conference. I&#8217;m looking forward to a few sessions, but with RailsConf and WWDC and another work trip all lined up for the coming few months, I&#8217;m feeling a little conferenced-out before I&#8217;ve even begun.</p>
<p>Here are the previous anniversary posts: &#8220;2006&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2006/03/mediocrity_is_the.html, &#8220;2005&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2005/03/year_three.html, &#8220;2004&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2004/03/two_years.html, &#8220;2003&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2003/03/at_sxsw.html, and &#8220;2002&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2002/03/sxsw.html.</p>
<p>Also checked out the new Apple Store at The Domain today, which is a couple miles from my house. Was 250th in line without really trying, and the weather was nice enough to work under the oak trees outside Starbucks. Took pictures with my camera phone which I don&#8217;t have the energy to post right now. Tonight I headed back downtown for the opening of &#8220;Jason Chalker&#8217;s&#8221;:http://manlyart.blogspot.com/ art show.</p>

			<p>&#8220;STAPLE! The Independent Media Expo&#8221;:http://www.staple-austin.org/ was last Saturday and it turned out great. The &#8220;animation panel I wrote about last week&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/animation_panel.html was a lot of fun and didn&#8217;t seem to suffer too much from my amateur moderating abilities. The projector worked, the films were great, and we filled an hour and a half with questions from the audience. Special thanks to &#8220;Damon&#8221;:http://www.damonclinkscales.com/ for working the lights and providing feedback afterwards.</p>
<p>My only regret is that I didn&#8217;t take a few minutes to snap photos or set up a video camera in the back to capture it. I left my camera in the car the whole day. Luckily other attendees took pictures of the rest of the show. Here are Flickr sets from &#8220;Freddie Avalos&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/freddieavalos/sets/72157594570835464/, &#8220;Toby Craig&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/ithinkican/sets/72157594574373510/, and &#8220;Marianne Ways&#8221;:http://flickr.com/photos/mways/sets/72157594569262131/. <b>Update</b>: Damon &#8220;snapped a picture&#8221;:http://flickr.com/photos/digitalnomad/413875252/in/photostream/ after all!</p>
<p>Sunday night was the &#8220;Animation Show&#8221;:http://www.animationshow.com/ at the Paramount and Don Hertzfeldt answered questions afterwards. His latest film may be my favorite of his yet. I worked with Robert at the Animation Show on cross-promotion between their show and STAPLE!, and they were so great to work with I hope we can join forces again next time.</p>
<p>I came away from the whole weekend inspired. Monday a new idea for an animated short film hit me. I think it&#8217;s time to dust off the animation table again.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In the tradition of other independent Mac developers such as &#8220;Mike Zornek&#8221;:http://clickablebliss.com/blog/2007/01/08/billable_the_first_100_days/, &#8220;Daniel Jalkut&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/191/lawful-prey, and &#8220;Gus Mueller&#8221;:http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/25.html, I&#8217;m going to share some sales information from the first 75 days of Wii Transfer.</p>
<p>The following chart shows daily sales (in units sold) for each day. I&#8217;ve also highlighted important milestones so you can see what affect they had on sales, such as shipping 2.0 (which brought many links) and increasing the price (from $9 to $14, which brought my first 2.0 day of no sales at all). Finally, there are a few spots where I show the average number of visitors.</p>
<p><img src="../images/2007/sales_75_days.png" width="600" height="220" alt="Sales chart" /></p>
<p>(As an aside, I created this chart in Keynote. I love software that is simple and flexible enough to be used for purposes outside its original developer&#8217;s intentions. I wrote &#8220;more on this subject back in early 2006&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2006/01/limitations_in_toys.html.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to tell, but the numbers on the right side are on average a little bit higher than the left. Not by much though. Sales just trickle in again right now (a few a day).</p>
<p>So what does it all mean? Here is the basic take-away: Sales are much better than I thought they would be, but not nearly enough to live off of. That&#8217;s okay, because I happen to love &#8220;my day job&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ (also writing Mac software). However, I can definitely see how it would be possible to do this full time, with some real marketing and a collection of several additional applications. I have done zero marketing for Wii Transfer except listing it on MacUpdate, VersionTracker, and Apple&#8217;s download site (where it was featured in the video section).</p>
<p>As you can see, there was a big spike in sales when 2.0 was released. This is a direct result of links from Mac sites like The Unofficial Apple Weblog and Daring Fireball, and gaming sites like Jostiq and others. When traffic goes up, sales go up. This opened my eyes because it really is all about getting your app in front of other users. &#8220;As I blogged about previously&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/wii_transfer_takes.html, I think I also missed some sales opportunities during this period because 2.0 was not very stable.</p>
<p>Other interesting stats: The conversion rate is between 2% and 5%. For every 100 downloads, a few people decide to purchase it. I think many active users probably end up paying for it. Instead of a trial demo period, some features are just crippled, and it isn&#8217;t very usable day-to-day without unlocking the full feature set (for example, with music sharing to the Wii, you can only play one song at a time &#8212; no iTunes playlists or shuffle).</p>
<p>There are at least a few pirates too. I&#8217;m not too worried about them because &#8220;you can&#8217;t stop pirating&#8221;:http://wilshipley.com/blog/2007/02/piracy-reduction-can-be-source-of.html, and most people are honest. One customer was even nice enough to tell me about a pirated serial number he found.</p>
<p>To everyone who purchased Wii Transfer, thanks! When I built 1.0, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I would work on it again. Now, several versions later at 2.2, I have a clear roadmap of features (and bugs!) to keep me busy.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Chris&#8221;:http://ycrtft.rethunkmedia.com/ and I headed over to Northcross Mall yesterday to take a final look at the conference center rooms before next week&#8217;s STAPLE! Expo. Although I&#8217;ve been on the planning committee since the very beginning of the conference over 3 years ago and actively involved for each of the previous 2 shows, this year is a little special because I&#8217;ve been organizing a panel on animation to complement the mostly comic book focused show. We have three great local animators this year: Aaron Romo, Evan Cagle, and Lance Myers. See the &#8220;STAPLE! guests page&#8221;:http://www.staple-austin.org/guests/ for more information on their work and our other featured speakers.</p>
<p>I also redesigned the web site last week, late Thursday night. In order to accommodate some CSS improvements and images from our new program, I had to abandon a few things from last year&#8217;s excellent design by &#8220;John Rubio&#8221;:http://www.johnrubio.com/ (who also did the logo). I hope to bring back elements of the old design for next year, though. There&#8217;s just not enough time in the day, and March is days away. I hate you February, for being so short.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>One of the most interesting (and difficult) parts of running an independent software business is responding to support email. It is very time-consuming and often more frustrating than writing code because the solutions can be illusive. You want to help the customer, but it&#8217;s not always obvious how.</p>
<p>Two blog posts in the last week take entirely different approaches to customer support. &#8220;The first is from Ryan Carson&#8221;:http://www.carsonified.com/web-apps/how-to-deal-with-abusive-customers, who is well known for DropSend and The Future of Web Apps conference. Here&#8217;s a snippet from his response to a customer:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am now marking your email address as spam and your communication will no longer get through. If you don&#8217;t want to use our service any more, please cancel your account.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I was relieved to read the comments, which are more sane. I think Ryan made a mistake in how he dealt with the customer, and wasted a bunch of time in the process. Adding a customer to your spam filter? Yikes. I would have refunded the customer their $5 immediately.</p>
<p>(I actually like a lot of what Ryan writes and the events he puts on, but lately I find myself noticing the differences. As another example, his post about &#8220;outsourcing programming work to Russia&#8221;:http://www.carsonified.com/misc/why-you-need-to-get-rid-of-your-freelance-developer-asap left me puzzled.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Joel Spolsky also wrote an essay&#8221;:http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html on support, and it&#8217;s just about perfect. I especially like his section on <em>memorizing awkward phrases</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s completely natural to have trouble saying &#8216;It&#8217;s my fault.&#8221; That&#8217;s human. But those three words are going to make your angry customers much happier. So you&#8217;re going to have to say them. And you&#8217;re going to have to sound like you mean it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For almost every support email I get, I start by responding like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hi Bob, Thanks for purchasing Wii Transfer. I&#8217;m sorry to hear it was not working correctly for you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This does three things right away that I think are important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greet the person by their name. Kind of like making eye contact. And it&#8217;s respectful without being overly formal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank them for using the product. If they haven&#8217;t bought it yet, replace &#8220;purchasing&#8221; with &#8220;trying.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apologize that the software gave them trouble. This is mostly equivalent to Joel&#8217;s &#8220;it&#8217;s my fault&#8221; phrase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I could probably respond faster by using some macro shortcuts that do this for me, I actually type this out every time, varying it slightly as is appropriate for the question. I then move on to the actual solution or follow-up question about their issue.</p>
<p>This is more than just trying to be nice to people. As someone in the comments to Ryan Carson&#8217;s post said: you need to show the customer that you are on their side. Going negative demonstrates that you care about receiving their money but not actually building something useful that makes their life easier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a portion of 37signals take on being on the customers side, from &#8220;Getting Real&#8221;:http://gettingreal.37signals.com/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At 37signals, all of our support emails are answered personally by the people who actually build the product. Why? First off, it provides better support for customers. They&#8217;re getting a response straight from the brain of someone who built the app. Also, it keeps us in touch with the people who use our products and the problems they&#8217;re encountering. When they&#8217;re frustrated, we&#8217;re frustrated. We can say, &#8216;I feel your pain&#8217; and actually mean it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Most people who buy Mac software from independent developers know that it&#8217;s only 1-5 people behind the company. We can&#8217;t compete with the Microsofts and Adobes of the world on application size, but we can compete on quality customer service. <em>Being small is a competitive advantage.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve exchanged at least a couple hundred emails in the last few months with customers or potential customers. (I don&#8217;t actually distinguish between users who have bought the product or who are just trying it out. They all get the same level of support.) Have I handled each one perfectly? Probably not. There are a few people who are still experiencing problems. But my hope is that just writing this blog post will serve as a guide and reminder of why taking support seriously is worth it.</p>

			<p>Wii Transfer 2.2 is taking longer to get ready than I had planned, so I&#8217;ve decided to post a public beta while the last pieces are polished up. You can &#8220;grab it from the news section&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ of the Riverfold site (lower right). It is very close to being done, but giant chunks of code have been completely rewritten. I hope the extra testing will help make 2.2 an extremely solid release, and get some of the new features in the hands of users as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new in 2.2? iTunes playlists and several new preferences to control picture sharing top the list, but there are at least a dozen changes underneath the hood.</p>
<p>The web server built into Wii Transfer has seen some work in particular. Music browsing now uses the iTunes Music Library.xml file for everything rather than look at directory contents, and you can change the port number on the fly without restarting Wii Transfer if there is a conflict with any other applications.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also added reflections to the album cover art! You can see a &#8220;screenshot here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/wii_transfer_cover.jpg and another one of &#8220;the collage for playlists here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/wii_transfer_collage.jpg (these are from Safari, but it looks mostly the same on the Wii). This was really fun to do, but unfortunately it somehow introduced a subtle double-release bug that I spent hours fixing. It would only happen if the album art could not be found in iTunes and while multiple connections were hitting the server (i.e. it was ultimately a threading issue), and maybe only every dozen requests.</p>
<p>I tracked it down by using ab (Apache Bench), pointed at Wii Transfer. I had a shell script with a bunch of lines that looked like:</p>
<p><code>ab -n 200 -c 4 "http://localhost:9000/m/Beatles.cover</code></p>
<p>This URL asks Wii Transfer to grab any album art from iTunes for The Beatles, apply the reflection and return the JPEG data. It is flexible because you can send it any search strings. Other examples might be: <code>Evanescence%20Door.cover</code> or <code>Zoo%20Station.cover</code>. I was a little surprised that my little server was actually pumping out pages fairly quickly considering all the AppleScript and Quartz stuff going on. 10-20 requests per second isn&#8217;t much for a real web application, but for an app that is by definition single-user, it&#8217;s perfect.</p>
<p>The reflection code was made even easier by &#8220;BHReflectedImage&#8221;:http://bithaus.com/2006/11/05/nsimage-reflection/, which I modified to work with black backgrounds and then wrapped up in other helper methods to composite the cover and reflection together. When I first ran across this code I didn&#8217;t even notice it was written by Jeff Ganyard, who I&#8217;ve known for years and still run into at WWDC. Thanks Jeff! This goes in the about box credits with a bunch of other mentions. There is a really active Mac developer community that contributes source pretty freely, and I hope to add a few things to that collection one of these day as well.</p>

			<p>I have been &#8220;iTunes-free for four weeks now&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/goodbye_itms.html, and I hate it. It must be like quitting smoking, except without the fear of dying always at your back. I stopped by a Best Buy the other day and <em>couldn&#8217;t find any CDs to buy</em>. How do you shop for music without listening to it first? How do you find new artists without &#8220;customers also bought&#8230;&#8221; sidebars? Years ago I might listen to the radio to discover new music, but that was before the dial was permanently stuck on NPR.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve Jobs dropped the bomb&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/ while I was at lunch yesterday, and I furiously read and re-read it and watched the fallout. Blog entries in NetNewsWire lit up like clockwork. As &#8220;I posted to Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton, when the balance tips again to user control we&#8217;ll look back at this as a real shift in thinking. And the reason you know it&#8217;s true is because it sounds redundant to say the words.</p>
<p>But today&#8230; I browsed for music on iTunes and then ordered CDs from Amazon.</p>
