			<p>One of our big projects at work just launched: the <a href="http://www.vitalsource.com/betterbooks/">VitalSource Store</a>. James Duncan Davidson and Mike Clark have posted about what it was like working on this project. My favorite posts include <a href="http://blog.x180.net/2005/07/rails_sandbox_d.html">this one about the Rails development sandbox</a>, and <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2005/07/12#ProduceConsumeXML">this one about RESTful web services</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.irelan.net/becoming/past/2005/08/16/this-is-the-part-where-i-get-to-talk-about-my-job/">Ryan also chimed in</a> earlier this week about the project. It feels good to write about work in this space for me too, something I have rarely done but will likely do more as our company becomes well known.</p>
<p>Although the software is now freely available like iTunes, we&rsquo;ve all been hard at work on this stuff for a while now. In fact the current Mac and Windows clients started life over 4 years ago, and there is a bunch of shared code in there from our internal tools that is older still. We&rsquo;ve been shipping product to customers the whole time, but it feels good to now open things up to anyone.</p>
<p>If you look below the surface, there is a pretty incredible foundation that we can build good stuff on top of. Comments like <a href="http://www.anarchogeek.com/articles/2005/08/18/vitalsource-bookshelf-itunes-for-ebooks">this one from Anarchogeek</a> hit on exactly what we are trying to do:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s amazing to me is how the vital bookshelf is a slick mix of a web / desktop application. It uses html, javascript, and css, but it also uses native windows and interface elements. It&rsquo;s very nicely done.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

			<p>Friday night we saw Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station at <a href="http://www.thebackyard.net/">The Backyard</a>. At one time far outside Austin, suburbia has now claimed most of the land around this uniquely Austin venue. We parked outside what will shortly be a Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, or maybe a Barnes &amp; Noble, or another of the too familiar cookie cutter retail shops that spring up around new neighborhoods. Walking over the dust, wire, and new concrete of the construction site, we were thankful for a chance to see a show at The Backyard before the landscape changes entirely, invaded by 24-hour parking lot lights and noisy cars.</p>
<p>Inside none of that could be seen or mattered, though, and the stars came out midway through the set on a clear sky above the open-air venue. Alison&#8217;s voice was beautiful and effortless. Songs from the O Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack, other great tracks like The Lucky One and Restless, and a bunch of incredible songs that were new to me. For the encore, her voice soared as if she hasn&#8217;t even really been trying before. The audience was moved and in the span of an hour I went from being a little familiar with a few songs, to a life-long fan.</p>
<p>Need some music? The <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewMix?id=40809933&amp;wm=1">Alison Krauss iTunes Essentials</a> is a good place to start.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I saw Howl&rsquo;s Moving Castle last night. When we showed up at the theater, I was surprised that they accidentally had the subtitled version, not the dub. It was great to see the original Japanese, and I look forward to comparing it to the English on subsequent viewings or when it hits DVD. The subtitles were very good &mdash; not the broken English you&rsquo;d expect from a cheap dub, so I expect the dialog is from the translation handled by Disney.</p>
<p>I should describe my first Hayao Miyazaki experience. I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about the history of animation, of a range of genres, styles, and studios, but my first exposure to Miyazaki actually came late, with the Disney dub of Kiki&rsquo;s Delivery Service. I knew there was something special about this film before I saw it, but finding a copy proved difficult due to lackluster marketing and poor distribution. I went to a few video stores in search of a rental before I finally found a VHS copy for sale and bought it.</p>
<p>Now, many of Miyazaki&rsquo;s earlier films are definitely geared more toward children, and this is especially true with Kiki. But I was completely blown away by the innocence and total sincerity in this film, and at the climax I was near tears. It is a masterpiece that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed watching over and over again now that I have my own children. Every second of film is there for a reason, with perfect pacing, dialogue, and emotion. From then I&rsquo;ve enjoyed his other films over the years, including a side trip while passing through Houston to see Princess Mononoke in the theater, since it was in very limited release, and of course Spirited Away, last year&rsquo;s <a href="../2003/10/porco_rosso.html">Porco Rosso premiere in Austin</a>, Totoro, and most of the rest.</p>
<p>So Howl&rsquo;s Moving Castle. I&rsquo;m not sure it was my favorite of his films, but it was very enjoyable, full of both originality and familiar Miyazaki themes. When it wants to be, the animation is beautiful, and the visuals stunning throughout. The acting of the lead character Sophie as a young and old woman is very believable, the movement and walk obviously well studied. Good work all around.</p>
<p>Watching a film like this, with at times such power and intensity, you&rsquo;d never believe that 2d animation has been written off by most decision-makers in this country. It&rsquo;s simply impossible to make a film like this in 3d, either now or 5 years from now, which means that the kinds of stories that can be told in U.S. feature animation are limited right now. As long as audiences are being entertained, few people will complain about this unnoticed drought, but the risk is that over time animation will be even more pigeon-holed than it already is.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Alright I gave in and bought a DS. The newly bundled Mario 64 was too much for me to resist. I justified it as an early father&#8217;s day present to myself.</p>
<p>It became increasingly obvious after E3 that Nintendo does not have a plan for a next-generation Game Boy, and instead they are putting most of their resources into the DS. The Game Boy Micro is a sweet little device, though.</p>
<p>What can I say about the DS after a few days use? It is at the same time flawed and brilliant. So much more bulky than the GBA SP, and a single screen alone is no bigger. The huge win is in the touch screen, which encourages innovative games that let you tinker, explore, or control your character in a new way. This system is just fun to use.</p>
<p>I picked up <a href="http://modojo.com/articles/reviews/ds/kirby_canvas_curse/">Kirby Canvas Curse</a> today and I&#8217;m loving it. As Nick from <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2005/06/14/impressions-kirby-canvas-curse/">4 color rebellion said</a>: &#8220;I here and now declare KCC the first true DS killer app. Combining elements of some of the best games of all time, Hal has created something totally fresh that sets the example of how to make a DS game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed. This looks like the first in a string of nice DS titles. Before now, I thought the PSP could actually do the impossible: beat Nintendo&#8217;s decade-long dominance of handhelds. But by the end of this year I think we will see quite a different story, with both DS and PSP clearly co-existing for some time to come.</p>
<p>And of course it comes down to the types of games that are being developed. The audience for Halo is not necessarily the same as for <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ds/strategy/nintendogschihuahuaandfriends/preview_6122817.html">Nintendogs</a>. But if you are trying to create for the hardcore and casual gamers, you need something from both on your platform.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,67854,00.html">Wired interview with Shigeru Miyamoto</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What&#8217;s happening with video games is the same thing that happens with anything new and interesting. At the beginning, everybody wants to see what it is. They gather around and check it out. But gradually, people start to lose interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people who don&#8217;t lose interest become more and more involved. And the medium starts to be influenced by only those people. It becomes something exclusive to the people who&#8217;ve stuck with it for a long time. And when the people who were interested in it at first look back at it, it&#8217;s no longer the thing that interested them.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found this very insightful &#8212; just that a game company is thinking about these things at that level &#8212; and it brings into focus my own &#8220;return&#8221; to gaming.</p>

The first two from high school &#8212; Heather, at Magnolia Cafe in Austin before leaving, then Joel randomly on Market Street in San Francisco. I wondered who I&#8217;d run into next, and the answer came a few days into WWDC when I spotted Bob Pudell, who hired me for an internship at Apple my second semester at UT, and from which I can trace just about every job I&#8217;ve landed since.</p>

			<p>The .Mac SDK session here at WWDC was interesting. First, it was forward-looking, not something we&#8217;ve seen much this year with the exception of Intel. Also, it wasn&#8217;t covered under NDA (hence this blog post).</p>
<p>The 2.0 kit will be Tiger-only when it ships next month, but it will provide some really powerful features such as publish-and-subscribe and secondary user accounts that live off a paid .Mac account. Lots of fun applications surely to come. Apple wants to enable deep collaboration across applications.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it&#8217;s been a few days and many developers have already brought their apps up on Intel. The general consensus now seems to be that this will be a smooth and very fast transition. If there are new Intel-based PowerBooks ready in January, there will be a wide-variety of popular apps ready for it.</p>
<p>I use CodeWarrior for most projects, but I was still surprised to hear Apple say that almost half of Mac developers have also yet to switch to Xcode. That will be the biggest chore for most people.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the good times Metrowerks. CodeWarrior was a great development environment, and in its time PowerPlant was a great framework. The Mac OS X transition has always been a mix of steps forward and back, and Xcode will be no different.</p>

			<p>Even before I arrived in San Francisco, and even before the rumors surfaced of Apple switching to Intel, this WWDC looked to be a unique one. For the first time since I can remember, the conference was mostly going to cover a shipping OS. Steve Jobs mentioned Leopard only in that we would hear about it more next year.</p>
<p>On the BART from the airport I met some fellow WWDC attendees (the Apple and Mac-hack 1995 t-shirts were an easy giveaway). We discussed the ramifications of Intel, what else might be in store. I still hoped for a new product line, maybe a tablet or something interesting and different as the first step to Intel.</p>
<p>And then everything changed, the rumors were true. It was a bold move, but as Steve Jobs said, Apple is strong right now. They know what they have to do to pull this transition off.</p>

			<p>Madagascar is easily the best of Dreamworks&#8217; (or PDI&#8217;s) recent animated films. The animation is filled with great character poses, holds, and snappy movement, and the designs and composition are fresh in a way that makes Shrek look only mediocre. And really, those penguins are hilarious.</p>
<p>While Madagascar was thoroughly entertaining, Dreamworks&#8217; first film, Prince of Egypt, still holds a special place for me. It was risky and dramatic in a way that few films were before or since. We are now clearly in the era of Pixar-inspired buddy comedies. Maybe audiences won&#8217;t grow tired of that formula, as they did 10 years ago when every studio was attempting to mimic Disney&#8217;s musicals, but I&#8217;m still hopeful that a traditional studio will seize the opportunity to reinvent the artform, again.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>After a colleague bought a PSP, I decided to re-evaluate the PSP and DS. I did some more research, looked at the available games, pricing, and features. I still enjoy my Game Boy Advance SP, and stand by <a href="../2005/01/new_year_gaming.html">what I wrote earlier in the year</a>.</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t place enough importance on how it is the games that sell a platform. Forgetting the price tag or the cool non-game features (internet and movies), the PSP&#8217;s initial game lineup wasn&#8217;t that appealing to me. If I wanted those games I would own a PS2. There are definitely a few gems in there, though &#8212; <a href="http://www.modojo.com/articles/reviews/psp/lumines/">Lumines</a> looks very good.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly when you consider the unique pen input option on the DS, the DS games are going in another direction entirely, and for the most part I like it. <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/atkj/about/movie/movie1.html">This video of an upcoming Kirby game</a> looks fun, similar to <a href="http://www.modojo.com/articles/reviews/ds/yoshis_touch_and_go/">the new Yoshi</a>. And then there&#8217;s <a href="http://thegamechair.com/?p=50">Electroplankton</a>, a bizarre title that is less game than musical experiment.</p>
<p>4 color rebellion on <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/?p=583">casual gamers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Many gamers are so emersed in the medium, or have been at it so long, that they dont look at the casual market with open eyes. All of those new gamers Nintendo is talking about? This is where they are. They dont know what Final Fantasy is. They havent beaten Super Mario 64. Its the simple, enjoyable games that get them interested.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I fall somewhere in between casual and hardcore gamer. I want games that I can learn fairly quickly, and that I can just as easily play for 10 minutes as 2 hours. I also enjoy old games (lately I&#8217;ve been mixing Advance Wars 2 with Super Mario Bros 2).</p>
<p>Getting back to the PSP vs. DS debate. Would I trade in two screens for a single screen the size of the PSP&#8217;s? Probably so. A next-generation Game Boy would ideally fit somewhere in the middle, with a larger screen than the current GBA but maybe not as big as the PSP, to keep that easy &#8220;in your pocket&#8221; advantage.</p>
<p>This illustrates the challenge Nintendo faces with their three-tier strategy. Although the DS can play GBA games, a new Game Boy is unlikely to play DS games. Nintendo is the unquestioned king of backwards compatibility, but it&#8217;s unclear how they are going to solve this puzzle.</p>
<p>After I wrote the above, Nintendo announced the <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/entry/1234000520043660/">Game Boy Micro</a>. This is not the next-generation device that some were expecting, but it sure looks cool. It is lighter than an iPod mini and just a little bigger. If the price is right (and I expect it will be), and it works with the <a href="http://gameboy.ign.com/articles/589/589659p1.html">Play-yan</a> for music and movies, this could be a killer little device.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>We all use web apps. Google Maps or Mapquest, Yahoo! Mail or Hotmail, Basecamp and FogBugz. The ubiquity of these services has reached the point where it is increasingly useful to point to them from other applications, web or native. Mac OS X&rsquo;s Address Book and Dashboard Yellow Pages both point to Mapquest.</p>
<p>Mac OS X Hints has a <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20050424065456133">hack to point Dashboard at Google Maps</a> instead, but what I&rsquo;d really like is system-wide settings for important classes of web applications. My default search engine, maps, or photo management apps could all benefit from this.</p>
<p>Sadly, even on the desktop &mdash; where native apps can easily register for protocol handlers and play nice with others &mdash; the situation is often closed. The &ldquo;Lookup in Dictionary&rdquo; command in Tiger&rsquo;s Safari is hard-coded to Dictionary.app, instead of checking what other app might have registered to handle dict:/// URLs. If dict:/// was replaced by http://www.dictionary.com/, it becomes even more extensible. But in Tiger, third-party developers who have a great dictionary application or web site are obsoleted without a user choice.</p>
<p>This problem will only become more exagerated over time. Every app that could potentially exchange data, whether web-based or not, should have an integration story. If the OS doesn&rsquo;t want to help this effort, perhaps an open framework in the spirit of the original Internet Config can fill the need.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>The other day I went for a walk and on the way back picked up a candy wrapper on the sidewalk, to throw away when I got home. If I pick up other people&rsquo;s trash (not a frequent activity, but not that uncommon either), I don&rsquo;t expect a thank-you or for anyone to notice. But this time I did receive a thanks, of sorts.</p>
<p>I opened our outside garbage can and staring at me from the bottom was a pile of cables and an original WebTV. I had bought the WebTV years ago. The reasons given for this strange purchase ranged from &ldquo;browsing the web in your living room is neat&rdquo; to &ldquo;it&rsquo;s for my mom&rdquo; (she didn&rsquo;t end up liking it). The ancient and mostly-useless device almost made it into one of our garage sales, on Traci&rsquo;s request, but I&rsquo;d always feel guilty even trying to sell it. It was obvious she had thrown it away, giving up on me and my often unreasonable tendency to <i>keep everything</i>.</p>
<p>Rummaging through the technology junk, I salvaged a Firewire cable, audio/video cables, a power cable, and a Laserdisc remote control. It felt good to finally close the lid on the WebTV. Who knows, maybe the Laserdisc will be next.</p>

			<p>Kelly is studying in Paris. She writes about <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/inkthought/93050.html">animating from your experiences</a> after talking with Pixar animator Bolhem Bouchiba:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But it made me realize something about good animation. It dosen&#8217;t come from studying other films. Or live action. Or acting. It comes, first and formost, from living life. From being hurt, being ecstatic, being bored, being in love, suffering, moments joyful and rich, things you can&#8217;t describe. It comes from experiencing them, and shoving them onto the paper. I don&#8217;t think you can animate something truthful if you&#8217;ve never felt it yourself.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			<p>I don&#8217;t like Safari-style tabs. Sure, I use them &#8212; and in NetNewsWire if you want to use the built-in web browser, there is no choice) &#8212; but I&#8217;ve always thought that there should be better ways to manage windows, and it should be built into the operating system. As left to third-party developers, each application implements tabs in a slightly different way. Everything from the visual appearance of tabs, to where they are attached to a window (drawer, sidebar, or toolbar), to how the close box works, to the keyboard shortcuts for opening and closing tabs, to the persistence of tabs.</p>
<p>Instead, Apple should have built upon Expos&eacute; to offer system-wide window grouping state, so that in any document-based application the user is in control of how windows are tabbed. Actions like dragging to rearrange tabs could be implemented once and work consistently across all applications.</p>
<p>Of course with Tiger now shipping, it&#8217;s probably too late. By the time 10.5 is announced a year from now the damage will be all but permanent. It always impressed me that Apple was so quick to roll out a standard toolbar implementation in both Cocoa and Carbon, and I think we would have seen similar gains from a tabs framework.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.animationshow.com/">The Animation Show&rsquo;s 2nd year show</a> came to Austin last weekend, and I was lucky enough to see it Sunday evening with Don Hertzfeldt taking questions afterwards. He discussed traditional animation, the dying art of shooting on actual film, and the four-year process of making his latest film, The Meaning of Life.</p>
<p>One of the things that struck me about this year is the running time of some of these shorts. 10 minutes is fine if it&rsquo;s brilliant work, as many of these are, but I was surprised that a couple films didn&rsquo;t hold my interest. Overall it was a great show, though. Some of the highlights for me were <a href="http://www.plymptoons.com/guarddog/">Guard Dog</a> (Bill Plympton), <a href="http://www.awn.com/oscars00/whenday.php3">When The Day Breaks</a> (rotoscoping as style instead of cheat), <a href="http://www.studionix.com/">Hello</a> (only animation can do this), and Pan With Us (stunning innovation in stop-motion).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nfb.ca/lhommesansombre/">The Man With No Shadow</a> was also a favorite. Don Hertzfeldt likes to talk about how real innovation in animation usually happens in short films, so it was appropriate that this film took an element that is usually the first thing to be removed from low-budget television or feature animation &mdash; shadows &mdash; and built a whole film around it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;s latest itself was good, but probably not equal to Billy&rsquo;s Balloon or Rejected. From <a href="http://www.bitterfilms.com/forum.html">his weblog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;there&rsquo;s a lot going on in there, tho on one level i think the film is sort of like a painting and what you take is going to be very personal and very different than the guy next to you.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2003 I posted <a href="../2003/07/22.html">my review of the first show<a/>.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2005/04/14/feeds.html">Dan Cederholm asks the relevant questions</a> about weblog syndication formats:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Will we forever continue to support multiple RSS formats as well as Atom? Is Atom succeding as a successor to RSS? Will this stop people from using the term &#8216;RSS&#8217; to describe an Atom feed? It&rsquo;s all very confusing &mdash; and that&rsquo;s coming from someone who actually understands some of this stuff.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The competition between Dave Winer and the Atom folks seemed pretty intense a year ago. Six Apart has pretty much shunned RSS from the beginning, preferring RDF and then Atom. Blogger made the controversial move from RSS 0.9 back in the Blogger Pro days, to Atom-only, and switched to the Atom API instead of the widely-deployed Blogger API that they developed. Atom gained a bunch of momentum, and steps to make it an official standard were well underway.</p>
<p>But then something interesting happened that no one expected, and it happened almost overnight: Atom was obsoleted.</p>
<p>RSS 2.0 won not because of the enormous number of major RSS 2.0 sites (although that helped), or because it was better (it&#8217;s not, really). It won because of podcasting. It all came together for me when I read Evan Williams post about podcasting and RSS, and he <i>didn&#8217;t mention Atom at all</i>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear by all the wp-rss.xml files out there that many of the Movable Type 2.x users are migrated to WordPress. The price of Movable Type 3.0 is hard to justify for personal sites, or even business ones for that matter.</p>
<p>The influence that Six Apart and Google had on syndication formats is vanishing. In the end it wasn&#8217;t even about politics at all.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s always interesting to see where 2d artists have gone after the decline of traditional, hand-drawn animation for feature films. That might seem an odd thing to say considering that recently a hand-drawn <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/heffalump/main.html">Pooh movie</a> opened in theaters, but also keep in mind that it was animated in Disney&#8217;s Japanese studio, which has since closed.</p>
<p>The documentary <a href="http://www.dreamonsillydreamer.com/">Dream on Silly Dreamer</a> follows this and similar tales as they unfolded in California and Florida. It will be making the festival rounds, and hopefully will show up in a city near you soon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.electricpigasus.com/">Masa Oshiro</a>, who worked on July Films&#8217; <a href="http://www.julyfilms.com/">My Little World</a>, is probably typical of many animators who have left the industry for a while, or for good. I found this snippet from his bio particularly revealing, a strange unintended mix of humor, hope, and sadness: &#8220;As the industry shifted from traditional to 3d animation, Masa left to pursue designing and sculpting small collectables.&#8221; (Those <i>are</i> <a href="http://www.electricpigasus.com/shop.shtml">cute turtles</a>, though.)</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Andreas Deja, perhaps the last of the master animators at Disney who refuses to give up his pencil. He&#8217;s working on the direct-to-video Bambi II, trying to infuse as much quality into it so as not to shame the creators. Surprisingly, early stills from the film don&#8217;t look half bad, even if the mere concept should be cause for concern. Keep up the good fight, Andreas.</p>
<p>Don Hertzfeldt is in a <a href="http://www.boltcity.com/photos/donshow/page1.htm">category all by himself</a>. His latest Animation Show festival hits Austin this weekend and will be a must-see.</p>

			<p>Leaving <a href="http://www.technorati.com/tags/sxsw">SXSW</a> I think I noticed two major themes at the conference this year:</p>
<p><strong>Software development.</strong> Jason Fried&rsquo;s talk on small teams set the tone here. Get close to your users, start building the real thing early, and keep it small so you can change easily. In <a href="http://nickfinck.com/presentations/sxsw2005/">&ldquo;How to Inform Design&rdquo;</a>, Jeffrey Veen took part of that one step further. Instead of user-centered design, he strives for <em>self-centered</em> design. If you become the user, you&rsquo;ll know how to build it.</p>
<p>Thinking about software development approaches &mdash; especially when they take an extreme position &mdash; is useful to me because you can take those statements and stamp them onto past successes or failures to see whether there is any connection. Many interesting work conversations followed.</p>
<p><strong>Metadata.</strong> Tags, folksonomies, and the lowercase semantic web. There were at least four sessions on this topic, from <a href="http://complexspiral.com/events/archive/2005/sxsw/">Eric Meyer&rsquo;s introduction</a> on XHTML-based microformats to the panel of RDF skeptics lead by Matt Haughey. These problems are hard to solve. When I was originally interested in an internet of rich metadata it never occurred to me that the solution might come from the grassroots, a virtual community of taggers bringing structure with nothing more than keywords and a few smart pieces of software.</p>
<p>Ultimately it&rsquo;s a UI issue. Flickr and Del.icio.us are successful because they make it easy and provide a clear incentive (the ability to find things again). Other distributed metadata initiatives are simple to use because they work within the existing web we know (XHTML and URLs), but we still need applications that will provide that same incentive for users to care. Maybe <a href="http://www.rubhub.com/">Rubhub</a> is a start.</p>
