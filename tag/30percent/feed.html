<blockquote><p>&#8220;But with this 30% thing, the 30% I&#8217;m really interested in is, will Apple eventually see 30% of its revenue come from various cuts, percentages, deals, and obligations? If so, that means a different focus for the company &mdash; a focus on things and people farther removed from me and you. And that makes me a bit bummed out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, neither of us is filling in for Steve Jobs, and Apple <em>can</em> do anything they want within the law. But what Neven captures so well here is that many of us hold Apple to a higher standard because Apple has a history of creating great things. This 30% business model doesn&#8217;t seem to have any place in that history.</p>
