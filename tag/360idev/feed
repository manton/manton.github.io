				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On &#8220;episode 35 of Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2010/11/episode-35-wrap-it-up-in-cocoa/ I mentioned attending the 360iDev conference, and we brought it up again on the next show while plugging 360MacDev. I had a great time at the conference and hope to attend another one in the future.</p>
<p>The best part was meeting all the iPhone developers who I&#8217;ve never crossed paths with, and catching up with others I&#8217;d only met briefly before. iPhone developers come from a mix of places, from old Mac developers to web developers to traditional mobile or game developers. While there&#8217;s a risk that having so many small regional conferences will fragment the community, this concentrated group of mostly iPhone-only developers made for a great few days of sessions and discussion.</p>
<p>And my main concern leading into the conference &mdash; that the hotel location would make it difficult for people to head downtown or see other parts of Austin &mdash; turned out to be mostly a non-issue. I had a great time hanging out with everyone in the evening, and hope some of you will be back for SXSW.</p>
<p>I used Tweet Library to &#8220;collect about 120 tweets from attendees&#8221;:http://www.tweetlibrary.com/manton/360idevaustin at the conference: reaction to sessions, quotes, speaker slide URLs, dinner out, and more. Capturing an event like this is why I built the app. What you had for dinner isn&#8217;t interesting by itself, but <em>in context</em> it is powerful because it tells a story.</p>
