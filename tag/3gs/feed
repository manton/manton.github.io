				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know it has been a good conference when you come back inspired, with ideas and tools to build new things. No surprise that WWDC was like that for me, as it is pretty much every year.</p>
<p>Even before the keynote was over I was getting questions &mdash; which continued all week &mdash; about whether I had iPhone plans. At the very least, Clipstart 1.1 needs to be able to import videos off of the 3GS. &#8220;That&#8217;s in beta now&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/forums/topic.php?id=26. But what about a native phone app?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve convinced myself over the last couple weeks, after listening to what people are doing with their phones and evaluating the existing applications in the App Store, that Clipstart for iPhone would be a very useful app. Video on the 3GS is a big deal. Eventually I can see a new top-level Video category in the App Store, and whoever is in that list is going to do very well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neven Mrgan&#8221;:http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/124025728/wwdc-2009 sums up the urgency:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure Phil Schiller&#8217;s prediction of iPhone 3GS quickly becoming the most popular video-capable phone &mdash; if not the most popular consumer video device period &mdash; is right on the money. A message for those working on apps that help us shoot, edit, organize, and share quick, casual video clips: get ready to get busy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit that after WWDC I panicked, thinking for a moment that I had to deliver Clipstart for iPhone immediately, and drop everything I&#8217;m doing to make that happen. I no longer believe that. The Mac version of Clipstart has a lot of potential and I can&#8217;t get too distracted from following up on that. But at the same time I will be expanding what I do on the phone, so we&#8217;ll see where that goes.</p>
