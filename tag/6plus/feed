				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people bought the iPhone 6 and then went back to the 5S. Some people bought the iPhone 6 Plus and then tried the 6. Some worked their way up to the 6 Plus after adapting to the 6. Some never upgraded to the 6 or 6 Plus because both are too big.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/04/06/life-with-the-iphone-6-plus">Marco’s post</a> is a good formal summary of a few write-ups I’ve read this week:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Having used an iPhone 6 full-time from its launch until these 6 Plus experiments over the last few weeks, I can confidently say that neither phone is extremely well-designed. Both have nontrivial and completely avoidable flaws. But the 6 Plus has bigger advantages over the other phones, while the 6 seems to sit in a mediocre middle ground.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The lesson from all these switches couldn&#8217;t be more clear: there&#8217;s no longer one perfect iPhone for everyone. What works great for one person might be terrible for someone else. I personally love the 5C design — the size of the screen, the way the plastic feels in my hand, flipping or spinning it on my fingers without worry that it’ll slip, using it without a case, adding <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/colours/">a little color</a> to my life — but many people never even tried it because it contains underpowered hardware compared to the latest models.</p>
<p>Apple would be crazy to discontinue any size. I&#8217;m more convinced than ever that we&#8217;ll see a 4-inch 6C alongside a new 6S and 6S Plus later this year. They won&#8217;t have identical specs, and that&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll happily pick the 4-inch model even if its camera is a year behind the cutting edge. The iPhone market is so ginormous now that I know there are millions of people who feel the same way.</p>
