				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I met Aaron briefly at SXSW, maybe 8 or 9 years ago, when the conference was still so small you could run into everyone. He wouldn’t remember me, but I followed his work and linked to him a couple times here. He was so young and already doing great things.</p>
<p><a href="http://lessig.tumblr.com/post/40347463044/prosecutor-as-bully">Lawrence Lessig</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “He was brilliant, and funny. A kid genius. A soul, a conscience, the source of a question I have asked myself a million times: What would Aaron think?”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2013/01/12/aaron_swartz">Brent Simmons</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “He’d gone on to do cool things — and make some mistakes, and get in trouble for them. But I knew he was extraordinary, and I expected him to grow up to become an American hero.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html">Cory Doctorow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Aaron had an unbeatable combination of political insight, technical skill, and intelligence about people and issues. I think he could have revolutionized American (and worldwide) politics. His legacy may still yet do so.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2013/01/12/aaron-swartz/">Daniel Jalkut</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “After witnessing a small extent of the struggles Aaron fought, I choose to commemorate him with gratitude for the many bad weeks when he resisted drastic action, and gave us all more time to appreciate and share his contributions.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>…<a href="http://twitter.com/danielpunkass/statuses/290318018901319680">and</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “You’ve honored Aaron Swartz by acknowledging what he did before he died. Now honor him by doing what he might have done.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Such a loss. For more links, <a href="http://watermark.io/collections/manton/aaronswartz1986-2013">I started a collection of tweets</a> when my timeline woke up to the news of Aaron’s death.</p>
