				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven&#8217;t paid too much attention to ad blocking until this week, even though I had been running the iOS 9 beta since WWDC. Several content blockers were released yesterday, like Marco Arment&#8217;s new app <a href="https://peace.land">Peace</a>. Marco writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;You won’t believe how fast browsing the web can be without the bloated, privacy-invading junk that too many publishers force on you <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/08/11/ad-blocking-ethics">without your knowledge or consent</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web">Nilay Patel has an essay</a> framing the issue as a fight between Apple, Google, and Facebook, with the web as a casualty:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;And with iOS 9 and content blockers, what you&#8217;re seeing is Apple&#8217;s attempt to fully drive the knife into Google&#8217;s revenue platform. iOS 9 includes a refined search that auto-suggests content and that can search inside apps, pulling content away from Google and users away from the web, it allows users to block ads, and it offers publishers salvation in the form of Apple News, inside of which Apple will happily display (unblockable!) ads, and even sell them on publishers&#8217; behalf for just a 30 percent cut.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m conflicted on this. I hate ads, and I think good publishers can adapt, but I&#8217;m also concerned that some progress we&#8217;ve made in native apps and user experience could be offset by steps <em>back</em> in open platforms. The health of the open web is more important than any one company, including Apple.</p>
