I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to see each of his films in the theater, and this is definitely his best yet. It has actually been finished for a while. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2002/09/bill_plympton_has.html">I posted about it back in 2002</a> when he started production. Before the showing I asked him about making an appearance at <a href="http://www.staple-austin.org/">STAPLE! this coming March</a> but it doesn&#8217;t look like his schedule will allow it. He&#8217;s one of about 4 animators I hoped to approach about showing their films at STAPLE!, in addition to some great local talent we&#8217;ll have speaking and showing their work.</p>
