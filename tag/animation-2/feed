				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1999, I started a link weblog to collect news about animated films. I updated it for a few years, until there were plenty of other good news sources from industry writers more qualified than I was to run such a site. I was just a fan.</p>
<p>The site was a homegrown MySQL database and set of PHP scripts. Somewhere along the way, I lost the archive, and never noticed that the site had broken until today. To make matters more difficult, I had blocked it in my robots.txt, so the Internet Archive copy (which existed, at least in parts) wouldn&#8217;t load cleanly.</p>
<p>I took some time today to piece it back together as a new static HTML file and (partial) RSS feed. I&#8217;ve preserved the original design and HTML tags. Fun rediscoveries in the HTML include spacer GIFs, &lt;blockquote&gt; to indent the entire page, and RSS 0.91.</p>
<p>I called it <a href="http://www.manton.org/lightbox/">The Lightbox</a>. It was just a linkblog. But now 16 years later, I&#8217;ve enjoyed skimming through the old posts.</p>

For the last few years I’ve attended the NeXT-themed fundraiser for the Cartoon Art Museum, and this year <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/7/an-hour-of-next-history">there’s video from the event</a>. Check it out for a view into the museum and some of the talks.</p>
<p>It’s always a highlight of the week for me to visit both the Cartoon Art Museum and the Walt Disney Family Museum. This year Cartoon Art had pre-production drawings and paintings from the hand-drawn film Song of the Sea, one of my favorite films of the year. Really beautiful stuff.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a couple weeks, Disney will close its “Magic of Disney Animation” attraction at Hollywood Studios. This area of Disney World was always one of the better ideas I’ve seen at an amusement park, mixing a ride with an actual working animation studio that produced Mulan, Lilo &amp; Stitch, Brother Bear, and bits of other Disney features. <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/theme-parks/magic-disney-animation-115193.html">Cartoon Brew writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It’s a bittersweet ending for an attraction that introduced many young people to the art of hand-drawn animation and inspired untold numbers of budding artists to consider animation as a career. One of the park’s original offerings after it opened as Disney/MGM Studios in 1989, it gave attendees the chance to watch Disney animators at work.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Before I had kids, I visited the park in the late 1990s and spent some time watching the animators. I asked the park employee if I could hang out after the tour had continued on, just standing there looking through the glass as an animator shot a pencil test for some rough or cleanup animation for a scene from Tarzan. I’m not sure how long I stayed there; it could have been 15 minutes or it could have been an hour. But I remembered every detail from that animated scene when finally seeing Tarzan in the theater, and for years after until today.</p>
<p>By the time we could take our kids there, Disney had already closed down their animation studio in Florida, turning the ride into an empty shell of what it used to be. I wish my kids could’ve seen it as it was meant to be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/03/25/censoring-myself-for-apple">Marco Arment reacts</a> to the idea that he’s withholding criticism:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “As anyone who’s read my site and listened to our podcast for a while would know, I criticize Apple <em>all the time</em>. A developer’s view of their computing platform and software distribution partner is like any developer’s view of their programming language of choice: if you don’t think there are any major shortcomings, you just don’t know it well enough yet.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is all true, but I also think there’s something unique about Apple: we expect greatness in everything they do. It wouldn’t be the same Apple we love if we brushed complaints aside when the company falls short. And as Marco points out, Apple employees aren’t scared of negative feedback, because they want to build great products too.</p>
<p>A number of years ago I was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2008/04/ollie_johnston.html">sick of programming</a> and went back to school to study art and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2003/10/old_life_drawings.html">life drawing</a>. Maybe more than anything else, I came away with a new appreciation for self-criticism, and accepting the critiques of others. Because that’s how you get better. Until you can <em>see</em> what’s wrong — your drawing sucks and your iOS app is slow and buggy — you have no hope to improve.</p>
<p>The key in both art and technology is to understand the difference between constructive criticism and just complaining. <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground">Marco’s original post</a> was about calling out Apple on lower quality standards in the hope that they could focus and get better. Many of the “me too” posts that followed were from Apple haters who were looking for page views and couldn’t care less if Apple quality improved.</p>
<p><a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2015/03/25/the-risks-and-rewards-of-criticism/">Daniel Jalkut writes</a> that it&#8217;s about how we react to criticism that matters:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;This is what happens when well-formed criticism meets the ears of a confident, competent individual: the facts are taken to heart and studied, perhaps grudgingly. But upon reflection and determination that there was merit in the complaint, respect for the source of the provocation goes through the roof.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been working on an essay about the Apple Watch Edition and why I think it’s wrong for Apple. I do worry a little about putting out a controversial, half-baked opinion. And yet, I’ve seen no one else make my argument against the Edition in the meantime. If I want Apple to live up to the very high standard I hold them to, I can’t withhold my opinion on the direction of the company, regardless of whether that opinion will be warmly received.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This line in a <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/space-jam-sequel-is-in-the-works-96410.html">blog post on Cartoon Brew</a> made me laugh:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It’s certainly possible to write a Looney Tunes script, just as it’s possible to eat a hamburger with your feet, but there are smarter, easier, and better ways to do it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Every industry that gets big probably has some of this. There’s the old school, the folks who know the right way to do things — for example, you start an animated film with sketches and storyboards, not words — and then there’s everyone who comes in afterwards, without the history and culture of what made it all work. Look at what the App Store has become, compared to how software development worked in the 1990s or early 2000s. If it wasn’t for all the money some of these new developers are making they’d be completely embarrassing themselves with technical naivety and <a href="http://www.bluecloudsolutions.com/blog/money-apps-turn-1k-200k-portfolio/">depressing lack of vision</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, great ideas often start with newcomers. But please respect the past before you break from it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 90s I bought a LaserDisc player because it was the best way to get bonus features like director’s commentary and “making of” shorts on some of my favorite movies, before DVDs took off. But I’ve resisted getting a Blu-ray player, even though studios seem to have completely shut out DVDs from the behind-the-scenes material we’re used to. Luckily artists can still share their work directly via the web.</p>
<p>I love this new site from Pixar artists, just in time for the holidays, on <a href="http://www.theblueumbrellamakingofholidaycalendar.com/">the making of their short film The Blue Umbrella</a>. It’s presented as a holiday calendar with a new page revealed each day. From day 3:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The second test I had made after having just been to a concert of Sarah Jaffe. I fell in love with her music and voice and desperately wanted to pitch her an idea for a music video. But I needed a concept for it. While walking through the city and listing to her songs I suddenly got this idea for a music video where a whole city would sing one of her songs.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s one of those rare sites that is so wonderful that I make an exception to not following it if there’s no RSS feed. Added to my bookmarks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“We spend a lot of time on a few great things.” — <a href="http://www.apple.com/designed-by-apple/">Designed by Apple in California</a></em></p>
<p>In 1940, Ub Iwerks, the animator behind Walt Disney’s first Mickey Mouse shorts, came back to the Disney studios after a 10-year absence. Ub had famously produced hundreds of drawings alone each day for one of those first Mickey Mouse shorts, but Ub’s return to Disney would also be remembered for his contribution to the technical side of film production, with advances in cameras and special effects. In an industry with extreme specialization — you either did backgrounds, or animation, or ink-and-paint — Ub’s talents bridged both the artistic and technical.</p>
<p>One of Ub’s inventions while away from Disney was called the multiplane camera. Perfected by others leading up to Snow White, in a massive camera stand over 10 feet tall, the multiplane’s innovation was to allow a background to be split into levels. Foreground trees might be painted on the glass of the first level, then the characters sat underneath that, and then farther back layers for a building, with others behind that for hills and sky.</p>
<p>To provide a sense of depth, camera operators could vary the distance between each plane. And movement for each level could be synchronized at different speeds, giving it a beautiful parallax effect. Distant background levels moved more slowly and were naturally blurred and out of focus.</p>
<p>80 years after Ub’s invention, the multiplane is alive in iOS 7. Previous versions of iOS were built on a single plane with raised and textured areas on that surface, like a topographical map except with buttons instead of mountains. iOS 7 is instead designed with multiple flat layers. Each level is strikingly flat, but by layering two or three, spaced apart, Apple has achieved an overall sense of depth.</p>
<p>It’s a return to basics. Simple things can remain simple, readable. When clarity is needed, everything goes flat. But it’s a framework that allows for subtle motion and depth without changing what works about the new, content-first flat design. iOS 7’s control center blurs the layer below. The home screen background sits deeper too, as if only the app icons are touching the screen. Photos scroll under the navigation bar.</p>
<p>Each plane is painted flat as if on glass. There can be no text drop shadows, no textures, without ruining the effect. And the result of this strict metaphor is equally valuable: there are no drop shadows to distract or obscure an app’s real content.</p>
<p>Disney’s multiplane camera, first in a dedicated rig and then recreated in software, lasted for decades, until the era of 3D computer animation. iOS 7’s new look won’t last that long, but the core concepts should carry Apple for years. I really like where they’re headed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/animators/happy-80th-birthday-richard-williams-79469.html">Richard Williams turned 80 years old</a> last month. Although his body of work is extensive, including Roger Rabbit and the unfinished masterpiece The Thief and the Cobbler, I think he will be most remembered many decades from now for the extraordinary book, The Animator’s Survival Kit.</p>
<p>I referenced this book all the time when I was working on a little hand-drawn short film several years ago. Now an iPad version of the book is available. Floyd Bishop, <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/animationscoop/first-look-the-animators-survival-kit-app-by-richard-williams">writing for Animation Scoop</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The timing of the animation examples in the book have always been hard for me to get my head around.  This app shows the drawings come to life through animation. You can loop playback or scrub through the animation. I found this feature to be the most useful thing about the app.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nowadays, I’m too busy with <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">software side projects</a> to have time for animation as a hobby, but as a huge fan I’ll occasionally catch up on news and all the beautiful work artists are doing.</p>
<p>A few of my favorite short films over the last year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/advertising/chipotle-taps-johnny-kelly-for-an-animated-short.html">Chipotle’s stop-motion video</a>. I was really happy to see it run during the Grammys last year. When I had showed my kids the video on YouTube earlier, they immediately fell in love with it. Kudos to Chipotle for giving it some high-profile national airtime. And don’t miss the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnnykelly/6095772979/in/set-72157627428599351/">amazing Flickr set of the production</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.disneyanimation.com/projects/paperman">Disney’s Paperman</a>. You’ve probably seen this by now, and behind-the-scenes similar to <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1671941/why-this-oscar-nominated-disney-short-looks-like-nothing-made-before#1">this profile from Fast Company</a>. Disney hadn’t innovated much in combining 2D and 3D since <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZA6nitNeYw">deep canvas on Tarzan</a> and the character work on Treasure Planet, both over 10 years ago. It’s great to see them back on the cutting edge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://video.disney.com/watch/croissant-de-triomphe-4d7b3aae690a98650d776d97">Mickey Mouse in Croissant de Triomphe</a>, supposedly the first in a series of new Mickey shorts. I would’ve preferred this to be more in the 1930s style, but this is still a lot of fun, and captures the spirit of the old Mickey shorts well.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, I was really excited that Disney’s Pixar won an oscar, and to see the reaction from director Brenda Chapman. Circling back to Richard Williams, she actually worked early in her career on Roger Rabbit, and then as a story artist at Disney and director on Dreamworks’s Prince of Egypt.</p>
<p>Brenda <a href="http://brenda-chapman.com/blog/wow-an-oscar/">said on her blog</a>, about the Oscar win:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “And when I was fretting over having just one guest ticket, my husband, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0510674/">Kevin Lima</a>, insisted that I take our daughter, Emma, with me. ‘You should share this with her,’ he said ‘it’s a mother and daughter night!’ Having Emma with me that night not only let me share with her one of the most wonderful nights of my life, it allowed me to tell the world how very much she means to me.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>So incredibly well-deserved. Animation is a painstakingly slow art form. The work of all these artists, from Richard Williams to Brenda Chapman, isn’t a 3-month mad dash to ship the next gimmick app to the App Store; it’s work that is measured across decades. Taken as a whole, I view it as an inspirational story of perseverance — a reminder that creating something great takes time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I follow <a href="http://twitter.com/sketchcrawl">Enrico Casarosa on Twitter</a>, I&#8217;ve been hearing about La Luna for what seems like a year. I was so happy to finally see the film run in front of Brave last weekend. Beautifully done and possibly my favorite Pixar short, perfect for a short film. (As an added bonus for seeing it at Alamo Drafthouse, they ran 7 other Pixar shorts before the feature started.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s so much interesting work possible with short films. Disney apparently has another great one up their sleeves in Paperman. <a href="http://billdesowitz.com/disney-delivers-game-changing-paperman-short/">Some of the early hype</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;From what they told me and from what I&#8217;ve glimpsed in these concept drawings and videos below, it could be a game-changer for hand-drawn animation. In fact, it&#8217;s a new holistic hybrid of 2D and 3D, thanks to an interface called Meander that they &#8216;hijacked&#8217; for the project from a young Disney programmer named Brian Whited, which was then refined by animator Eric Daniels and others. It&#8217;s a vector-based tool that empowers the animator with digital in-betweening and puts the drawings back on the screen.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Also check out the series of YouTube teasers from the director: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Mdhv0A07YA">the idea</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhGzKHXhbKs">the look</a>. And <a href="http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/06/28/first-look-paperman/">the first still shots from the film</a>.</p>
<p>This kind of has <a href="http://www.manton.org/2008/04/ollie_johnston.html">why am I still programming</a> written all over it for me.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walt&#8217;s nephew &#8220;Roy Disney died this week&#8221;:http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/12/16/roy.disney.obit/index.html. In 2003 I blogged about &#8220;Roy leaving the company&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2003/12/roy_leaves.html. I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame that Roy is the one to leave. It&#8217;s clear that Disney (the company) has lost its way, and Eisner has no vision for what the company could be.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Luckily for us, since that time a lot has changed, and the animation division does have leadership in John Lasseter. One of the most visible changes just opened in theaters last weekend: The Princess and the Frog. I&#8217;ve seen every theatrical release out of Disney feature animation since I could afford the few bucks to go to a theater, so I wasn&#8217;t likely to miss this return of 2d animation.</p>
<p>My daughters and I really loved this movie, not just because of my love for hand-drawn animation, but for a story that works and characters that are rooted in something real &mdash; singing Cajun fireflies and voodoo magic aside, of course. There are some really touching scenes here. &#8220;Sandro Cleuzo says&#8221;:http://inspectorcleuzo.blogspot.com/2009/12/milt-kahl-day-12.html the animation was rushed, but I think they did a heck of a job.</p>
<p>The credits are almost as if nothing has changed &mdash; Eric Goldberg, Andreas Deja, Mark Henn, Nik Ranieri. &#8220;The reality is slightly different&#8221;:http://www.dreamonsillydreamer.com/, but there&#8217;s a mix of new animators among the familiar names. A lot is riding on the success of this film, and it managed a respectable $25 million over the weekend.</p>
<p>Great job, Disney. I&#8217;m glad Roy got to see the beginning of the next 2d comeback.</p>
