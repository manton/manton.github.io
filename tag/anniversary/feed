				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Brent Simmons is still looking&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2009/03/07/still_looking_for_a_version_control_syst for the perfect version control system:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People talk about how wonderful are features like re-writing history &mdash; and I read that stuff and think, &#8216;Wow, Git&#8217;s really cool and powerful.&#8217; But then I know it could suck me in and take away time from _real_ work. It&#8217;s _already_ more work &mdash; _for me_ &mdash; than when using Subversion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used Git much since Daniel and I discussed it on an early &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ episode. Like Brent I just don&#8217;t see a big win for single-person projects, although it&#8217;s fascinating to watch how open source projects are using &#8220;Github&#8221;:http://github.com/.</p>
<p>I like what Brent did a few months ago with his blog redesign, how both inessential.com and ranchero.com complement each other. He also wrote &#8220;more about his publishing system&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head, including a bit in passing about the tool I used to start my blog, Radio Userland.</p>
<p>I mention it because this blog is 7 years old today. Happy birthday to manton.org.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ten minutes until midnight as I type this. I started this blog 5 years ago. There have been just 329 posts in those 5 years, but there are some good ones in there. One thing I&#8217;ve noticed is that over the years I&#8217;ve switched from collecting links and providing short commentary, to more thoughtful longer posts. I&#8217;m hoping in this next year to go back to more of the earlier style.</p>
<p>My weblog anniversary also means that &#8220;SXSW&#8221;:http://www.sxsw.com/ is starting. I don&#8217;t plan to blog this weekend, but will instead be updating through &#8220;my Twitter account&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton. To be honest I&#8217;m not sure what to expect from this year&#8217;s conference. I&#8217;m looking forward to a few sessions, but with RailsConf and WWDC and another work trip all lined up for the coming few months, I&#8217;m feeling a little conferenced-out before I&#8217;ve even begun.</p>
<p>Here are the previous anniversary posts: &#8220;2006&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2006/03/mediocrity_is_the.html, &#8220;2005&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2005/03/year_three.html, &#8220;2004&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2004/03/two_years.html, &#8220;2003&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2003/03/at_sxsw.html, and &#8220;2002&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2002/03/sxsw.html.</p>
<p>Also checked out the new Apple Store at The Domain today, which is a couple miles from my house. Was 250th in line without really trying, and the weather was nice enough to work under the oak trees outside Starbucks. Took pictures with my camera phone which I don&#8217;t have the energy to post right now. Tonight I headed back downtown for the opening of &#8220;Jason Chalker&#8217;s&#8221;:http://manlyart.blogspot.com/ art show.</p>
