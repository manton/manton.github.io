				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://taylorswift.tumblr.com/post/122071902085/to-apple-love-taylor">Taylor Swift writes on her blog</a> (via <a href="http://www.imore.com/taylor-swift-explains-why-1989-wont-be-streaming-apple-music">iMore</a>) that she’s hopeful Apple will be the first company to get streaming right, but that she can’t agree to 3 months of artists not getting paid:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period… even if it is free for the fans trying it out.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Taylor. Apple still has a mountain of cash. Seems reasonable for them to use it to launch Apple Music properly and get musicians excited about the service. Usage will be higher during the free trial, so it would be a nice gesture to the music community, even with some kind of reduced royalties.</p>
<p>Imagine if Apple had launched the Mac App Store with this same model, where users could try apps for free and developers wouldn’t get paid for the first 3 months. Pretty unacceptable.</p>
