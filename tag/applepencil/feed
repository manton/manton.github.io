				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best pieces of advice that I never followed very well is that if you want to be a better artist, always have a sketchbook with you. That’s why I’ve been so excited about the Apple Pencil, since it transforms the tablet you might already have with you into a great sketchbook too. There&#8217;s only one problem: you have to actual remember to bring the Apple Pencil everywhere.</p>
<p>Myke Hurley gave <a href="http://mykewasright.com/post/142625337481/apple-pencil-hacks">an overview on his blog</a> about some of the additions he&#8217;s purchased to customize his Apple Pencil, like a clip, stickers, and this loop to hold it to the iPad Pro:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Wherever my iPad Pro goes, I want the Pencil to be with it. So to make sure I didn’t have yet another thing to remember, I decided that I had to find a way to attach the Pencil to the iPad. And that’s when I came across the <a href="http://www.cultpens.com/i/q/LC22369/leuchtturm1917-pen-loop">Leuchtturm1917 Pen Loop</a>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2016/04/12/ep-151">the latest The Talk Show</a>, Serenity Caldwell shares the tip of buying a $2 Micron pen and snapping off the clip to use on the Apple Pencil. <a href="https://twitter.com/DogRoomProds/status/669209496720416769">See this tweet</a> for what it looks like.</p>
<p>Lately I had been carrying the iPad Pro around <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/04/3815.html">without a bag</a>. This also meant leaving my Apple Pencil at home. While I don&#8217;t use my Apple Pencil every day, <em>I want to</em>. With a bag I can carry the iPad more easily and also always have a spot for headphones and the Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>I ordered the Tom Bihn <a href="https://www.tombihn.com/collections/briefcases-and-messenger-bags/products/daylight-briefcase">Daylight Briefcase</a> and I&#8217;ve been using it all week. You can see it in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/04/bee-cave-public-library.html">this photo</a> I took while setting up to work at a library the other day. I haven&#8217;t used a messenger-style bag in a long time, maybe in forever. (Apple handed out one to WWDC attendees years ago before they transitioned to the jackets phase of WWDC of freebies, but I gave most of my bags away.)</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;m really enjoying having a bag that doesn’t feel oversized for the iPad Pro. It&#8217;s much smaller than my full backpack. I expect that it will be perfect not just around town but also for traveling light.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been conflicted about which iPad Pro to use ever since the 10-inch rumors started. If both sizes had been available right away, I think I would have bought the smaller version. Small is convenient; I still really like and use even the iPad Mini. But there was only one iPad Pro when the Apple Pencil was introduced, so I bought that one.</p>
<p>Luckily the 13-inch iPad Pro still has some nice benefits. More room for split-view apps, of course, but also 4 GB of RAM compared to the new iPad Pro’s 2 GB. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-9-7-inch-ipad-pro-has-2-gb-of-ram/">Federico Viticci</a> is sticking with the big one:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  2 GB of RAM was one of the first things I heard about the new device yesterday, and part of the reason why <a href="https://www.macstories.net/roundups/the-9-7-inch-ipad-pro-our-complete-overview/">I’m going to stick with the 12.9-inch Pro</a>. In addition to a more comfortable iOS experience, I like knowing that I&#8217;m using the most powerful iPad hardware currently available (I don&#8217;t count the camera as essential to what I need to do on an iPad).
</p></blockquote>
<p>I realized this week that I was wasting time wondering which iPad is the best for me. It’s the ol&#8217; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice">paradox of choice</a>. So to cement the decision, I went by the Apple Store yesterday and picked up a Smart Keyboard for the 13-inch. I’ve been meaning to get one for months, and now that I have it, it makes even less sense to trade in my iPad for a different one. (The keyboard really does transform the iPad. It&#8217;s great.)</p>
