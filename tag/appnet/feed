				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/we-did-it">App.net passed its $500,000 funding goal</a>. A few weeks ago when I signed up with my $50, I didn&#8217;t think they could do it. And Daniel and I were both pessimistic about their chances when we talked about it on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2012/07/episode-50-dont-get-too-attached/">Core Intuition 50</a>.</p>
<p>In less than a month, they went from a mission statement video that seemed just a step away from vaporware, to following through on an API spec and then alpha version web site. They delivered. The momentum of <em>shipping something real</em> brought in new users and drove them to the finish.</p>
<p>What I love most about App.net is the transparency. Founder Dalton Caldwell is a blogger, like one of us. Where we only hear from Twitter&#8217;s CEO, Dick Costolo, through big news publications or at conference keynotes, for Dalton we hear it directly from his own blog posts, the way a small company should communicate. Being on the ground in posts and tweets is a perfect complement to his goal of treating users and developers as real customers.</p>
<p>App.net will never overtake Twitter. Look no further than hashtags all over the Olympics as proof of that. But App.net can put pressure on Twitter to respect third-party developers, and with thousands of paying customers, all with a vested interest in making App.net something worthwhile, App.net has already surpassed every other Twitter clone that has tried and failed to build a community.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ambitious.html">Paul Graham&#8217;s essay on ambitious startup ideas</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The way to win here is to build the search engine all the hackers use. A search engine whose users consisted of the top 10,000 hackers and no one else would be in a very powerful position despite its small size, just as Google was when it was that search engine. […]</p>
<p>  &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry if something you want to do will constrain you in the long term, because if you don&#8217;t get that initial core of users, there won&#8217;t be a long term. If you can just build something that you and your friends genuinely prefer to Google, you&#8217;re already about 10% of the way to an IPO, just as Facebook was (though they probably didn&#8217;t realize it) when they got all the Harvard undergrads.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s talking about search engines, but it could be anything. Get those 10,000 passionate users and you have a chance to take on the giants in the industry. As of this writing, App.net has 8000 paying customers. And 25% of them signed up at the developer tier. I&#8217;m sure every developer with a popular Twitter app has already looked at the App.net API documentation.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa/status/234709098124414976">John Siracusa tweeted</a> after App.net successfully funded: &#8220;Now comes the hard part.&#8221; Totally true, but just reaching this point was difficult — a perfect mix of great timing and even better execution. In the first 30 days, we saw a team that knows how to win. Let&#8217;s see what they can do next.</p>
