				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>&#8220;Marco Arment wrote an interesting piece&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/1432156914 on the Mac App Store shortly after it was announced. I was nodding my head in agreement for much of it, until I got to this part:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And if the Mac App Store is only populated by a subset of today&#8217;s Mac software, a few key points (such as &#8216;Inexpensive&#8217;) still won&#8217;t be true. This is why I believe that the Mac App Store will be dominated by (and become known for) apps that don&#8217;t exist on the Mac today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He makes great points, and I think his assumptions about Apple&#8217;s rules are correct. But newcomers dominating the store? And $1 apps as the second most popular price point on the Mac? I&#8217;m not convinced.</p>
<p>Many iPhone app hits lend themselves to a mobile environment, but the Mac is different because <em>people usually buy computers to get work done</em>. You don&#8217;t have your MacBook Pro with you while you&#8217;re waiting in line at the grocery store. You don&#8217;t have it at a party when your friend tells you about the latest game. You don&#8217;t hand your computer to your kids when they&#8217;re bored in the car and want to play Angry Birds.</p>
<p>If $1 apps will be so common on the Mac App Store, why aren&#8217;t they common on the iPad? In the iPad top 10 right now there are only two 99-cent apps. Prices around $2.99 or $4.99 are much more common, and there are plenty of $10 apps as well in the top paid and especially top grossing lists. The iPad app making the most money right now is a $20 music app called &#8220;djay&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think $10-$20 will be pretty common on the Mac App Store, but not $1, and not even $2 or $3. Something that&#8217;s priced so cheap sends a clear message on the Mac: this app is useless and should have been free.</p>
<p>As I said recently on &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/, I absolutely wish all the best of luck to iOS developers and designers moving to the Mac. I had a great time hanging out with a mostly iOS group at 360iDev last month; these guys are ambitious and smart and bring innovation to the platform because they don&#8217;t have the baggage that the rest of us have. 2011 will be a fantastic year for new Mac software and for indie developers!</p>
<p>But take a good look at some of your favorite apps for iPhone and iPad and you&#8217;ll see that for the most part they lack the depth to compete with established Mac software. The workhorses on your Mac &mdash; text editors, image editors, file transfer apps, version control clients, web site tools &mdash; won&#8217;t be knocked off by new competition easily.</p>
<p>Maybe 10.7 Lion will be a revolution, but when the Mac App Store first launches on 10.6 it&#8217;s going to contain familiar software at familiar prices.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Apple&#8217;s announcement yesterday of a Mac App Store is big news. As soon as the event was over, journalists reached out to developers to get feedback on what it means for existing Mac shops. Reading the variety of responses is fascinating to me, and I contributed some quotes for articles in &#8220;Macworld&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/155061/2010/10/developers_mac_app_store.html and &#8220;Cult of Mac&#8221;:http://www.cultofmac.com/mac-app-store-more-developer-reaction/65036. There&#8217;s also a &#8220;write-up on Ars&#8221;:http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/10/mac-app-store-boon-or-bust-for-developers.ars.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s &#8220;Wolf&#8217;s take on the guidelines&#8221;:http://rentzsch.tumblr.com/post/1369652253/mac-app-store:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My fellow Mac developers are laughing at the Mac App Store guidelines. They&#8217;re reporting that apps they&#8217;ve been shipping for years &mdash; a number of them Apple Design Award-winning &mdash; would be rejected from the Mac App Store. These are proven apps, beloved by their users. The current guidelines are clearly out-of-touch.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Every developer I&#8217;ve talked to uses at least some private APIs on the Mac, often to work around bugs or limitations in current APIs. It&#8217;s disappointing that the Mac App Store is shipping before 10.7, because 10.7 would be a good opportunity to find out why developers still need private APIs and bake support directly into the next version of Mac OS X to solve common issues.</p>
<p>Can you imagine such rock-solid apps as BBEdit or Transmit being rejected from the Mac App Store? It&#8217;s going to be a lonely launch day full of hasty iOS ports if Apple doesn&#8217;t show some common sense when approving Mac apps.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Before I released &#8220;Tweet Library&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/, I talked to everyone who would listen about the price. Several people suggested I go with a free app, but use in-app purchase to upgrade to the full version. Two apps that handle this well include &#8220;Twitterrific&#8221;:http://twitterrific.com/ and &#8220;SimpleNote&#8221;:http://simplenoteapp.com/. Countless games also take this approach.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the closest thing the App Store has to demos, but it comes at a cost: anyone can leave a 1-star &#8220;too expensive&#8221; review of your app without even upgrading to the full version. At that point they are not even rating the app they downloaded (a free, limited version that probably works just fine); they are simply commenting on a portion of the app they didn&#8217;t want to buy.</p>
<p>There are two ways to give me feedback about Tweet Library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email support, post to Twitter, or write on your blog about the software. This is free.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leave a review in the App Store. This is $9.99.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m very comfortable with this model. The quality of feedback I get in email is extremely high, whether the customer has bought the app or not, and the App Store reviews aren&#8217;t cluttered with pricing rants.</p>

				<a href="../../../2010/10/tweet_library_10.html" rel="bookmark">Tweet Library 1.0</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>If you purchased, tweeted, blogged about, rated, or mentioned <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> thank you. I&#8217;ve been very happy to see how well it is being received. I built this app because I wanted to do more with Twitter, but I didn&#8217;t really know until it was released if anyone else would care.</p>
<p>The truth is, I released it a tiny bit too early &mdash; there are a few annoying bugs that I&#8217;ll need to fix soon for 1.0.1 &mdash; but it was a long development cycle, and faced with getting burned out on a project the only thing I know how to do is ship it. Then I can use the reaction from real customers to tell me if I&#8217;m on the right track and where to go next.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already blogged about the pricing and <a href="../../../2010/09/next_generation.html">viability of third-party Twitter apps</a>, though I hadn&#8217;t officially announced the app yet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When Twitter for iPad shipped it jumped to the number 1 spot in free apps, but maybe you don&#8217;t have to compete directly with that. Maybe if you hold your ground somewhere in the top paid list, that&#8217;s enough to find an audience.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Tweet Library has only been out for 3 full days, and I don&#8217;t want to jinx it, but so far this theory is holding. The app went to #2 for top grossing iPad apps in social networking in the first day. I didn&#8217;t expect that, but at $10 I can see how it might happen. Then it also climbed to #2 in top paid iPad apps in the same category, and stayed there for a couple days before dropping to #3 as I write this. The only other Twitter apps in any of the top 10 lists for iPad are Twitter&#8217;s official app and TweetDeck, both free.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that because it kind of blows my mind a little: Tweet Library has been the best-selling iPad Twitter app since it was released.</p>
<p>How did I successfully ship an app in a crowded market at literally 2x the price of any other app? Two things:</p>
<p><em>Refuse to compete on price.</em> I felt so strongly about this that I was willing to launch and fail. If the App Store couldn&#8217;t support $10 Twitter apps, then I would bow out. I saw in <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/10/06/tweet-library-for-ipad-makes-twitter-useful/">a comment on TUAW</a> that someone would wait until the price lowered, but I hope to avoid the pricing gimmicks common to the App Store. There&#8217;s no intro price for Tweet Library, and the price is not going to change. I believe consistency is the best long-term plan for app pricing.</p>
<p><em>Market the app as something new first and yet another Twitter app second.</em> I believe the key to selling Tweet Library is to focus the marketing around what makes it special: archiving tweets, curating tweets, filtering tweets. Yes, you can also post to Twitter and see mentions or reply to DMs, but that is just the price to get in the door. Tweet Library doesn&#8217;t do those common tasks perfectly yet, but customers seem willing to cut me some slack because of all the other unique features that the app offers.</p>
<p>So, up next I&#8217;m going to fix bugs, and I&#8217;m going to add features, and I&#8217;m going to listen to customers. I&#8217;m sure it will soon drop out of the top 10 and other Twitter apps will take its place, but I feel like the launch was strong enough to prove that I&#8217;ve got something. I intend to carve out a little niche in the Twitter market and execute on it.</p>

			<p>I feel bad admitting it, because some of my friends are betting on iAd revenue to feed their family, but I&#8217;m just not on board with Apple running an advertising network. I don&#8217;t want to see ads in my apps, and I don&#8217;t want Apple to ever lose even a little of what it means to be a product-driven company.</p>
<p>We talk about this on Core Intuition. Nearly every chance I get I like to point out that all these free Google apps come at a cost. <a href="http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/1317967543">Take this tweet</a> from last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Google Voice is so awesome but I just think it&#8217;s dangerous to give Google this much power. Slippery slope, folks. You are not a customer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.metafilter.com/95152/Userdriven-discontent#3256046">And this comment</a> on MetaFilter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you are not paying for it, you&#8217;re not the customer; you&#8217;re the product being sold.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some apps should absolutely be ad-suported (such as a search engine or social network), and many can be freemium (free versions supported by higher-priced subscriptions), but when given a choice I&#8217;d rather pay a fair price for a good service. When your customers are not your users, the product will suffer.</p>
<p>I know the world is full of ads already. We&#8217;re used to it &mdash; numb to it, maybe. But think about what the App Store has done: millions of people are paying real money for apps that complement ad-supported web sites. These same people would never pay a subscription fee to use the web site, but they&#8217;ll pay a few bucks for the same features in an iPhone app <em>and it seems perfectly normal</em>.</p>
<p>Do we really want to give that marketplace up? Because once it&#8217;s gone, and iAds are the norm, it will be an uphill battle to get anyone to pay for anything.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Mike Rohde racked up $190 in iTunes in-app purchases&#8221;:http://www.rohdesign.com/weblog/archives/003193.html without knowing it, blaming an app called &#8220;Fishies&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fishies-by-playmesh/id360868737?mt=8 by PlayMesh for tricking his son into purchasing virtual items without a password prompt. He was obviously pretty upset &mdash; I would be too! &mdash; but calling it a &#8220;scam&#8221; probably goes too far. So what really happened?</p>
<p>It is fairly well known that after the App Store prompts for your iTunes password, you can download more apps for a certain length of time (at least a few minutes) before it requires a password again. What seemed less clear is that this applies to in-app purchases as well.</p>
<p>To be sure, I ran a test to confirm the behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download a new free app from the App Store (I downloaded the current number 1 iPhone app, Farm Story Summer).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter your password to confirm the download.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as it finishes, go to another completely different app (in my case it was Iconfactory&#8217;s Ramp Champ, which I had downloaded months ago).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchase an in-app virtual item.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It prompts for whether you want to buy the item (the standard Apple prompt), but <em>without requiring a password</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What must have happened to Mike is that he bought something, entered his password, and then handed the iPad over to his son. His son played the fish game and clicked a bunch of random stuff (likely got the Buy prompt), but because the whole concept of virtual currency is kind of confusing, and because it didn&#8217;t ask for a password, the app happily let him make all the purchases.</p>
<p>I doubt the developer of this app did anything wrong. A reasonable argument could be made that iTunes should either not cache passwords at all, or keep a separate cache for app downloads vs. in-app purchases, or maybe always prompt for a password on in-app purchases. My kids and other kids I know have also used this backdoor trick to sneak a couple app downloads, but usually it&#8217;s a few bucks, not $190. Consumable virtual items (that you can keep buying over and over) make this problem much worse.</p>
<p>On &#8220;episode 60 of This Week In Startups&#8221;:http://thisweekin.com/thisweekin-startups/this-week-in-startups-60-with-neil-young/, Jason Calacanis interviewed ngmoco founder Neil Young about the mobile game business, focusing on the hit iPhone/iPad game &#8220;We Rule&#8221;:http://werule.ngmoco.com/. I was stunned to learn from the show that some individuals spend not only hundreds of dollars but up to $10,000 on in-app purchases in We Rule. Neil Young was happy to take their money, but something feels wrong here, like a gambling addiction gotten way out of hand. Or maybe just kids running up their dad&#8217;s credit card bill.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m fascinated with App Store pricing. There&#8217;s just so much interesting stuff going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>99-cent apps and the race to the bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users expecting apps to be cheaper because the device is smaller.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The high-end successes like OmniGraffle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sales and pricing gimmicks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether apps can compete outside of the top 100.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So when 37signals launched their first iPad app &mdash; Draft, for sketching mockups and quickly uploading them to Campfire &mdash; the first thing I wondered was: &#8220;how much?&#8221; The comments on their &#8220;launch blog post&#8221;:http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2420-launch-draft-for-ipad are a hilarious and sad mix of the usual cheapskates balanced with 37signals defenders. But the most amusing part is that at only $10, Draft is a bargain compared to Campfire itself, which has an entry-level paid plan of nearly $150/year.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m a big Campfire fan, actually. The best iPhone client for Campfire, Ember, has a permanent spot on &#8220;my home screen&#8221;:http://www.firstand20.com/homescreens/manton-reece/.)</p>
<p>My first indie iPad app, a 3-4 week project that has stretched to 3-4 months, will also be $10. At that price it will be twice as expensive as its competition. I&#8217;m pricing it that way for three main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s worth the price of two trips to Starbucks, because it takes the category in a new direction with features no one else is doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s designed for people who are serious about this stuff, not an impulse buy, not for everyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#8217;s a standalone app but includes an optional web complement, offered for free, but which will incur &#8220;real hosting costs&#8221;:http://www.heroku.com/.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Daniel Jalkut and I talked about this a bit on &#8220;Core Intuition 28&#8243;:http://www.coreint.org/2010/04/episode-28-the-ipad-super-episode/ &mdash; that it might be okay to overcharge a little for 1.0 rather than raise the price later, and that it should be possible to build a business on the iPad the same way many developers have on the Mac: not by looking for the big overnight hit but by steadily selling some number of copies every day and letting it spread by word of mouth.</p>
<p>Marco Arment wrote about this as &#8220;App Store B&#8221;:http://www.marco.org/208454730 in October last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;More of their customers notice and demand great design and polish. More sales come from people who have heard of your product first and seek it out by name. Many of these apps are priced above $0.99. These are unlikely to have giant bursts of sales, and hardly any will come close to matching the revenue of the high-profile success stories, but they have a much greater chance of building sustained, long-term income.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re three months into the iPad, just passed 3 million devices sold, and not every app has dropped to near-free. I think $10 iPad apps in particular are going to remain pretty common.</p>

			<p>It appears I was too optimistic &#8220;in my last post&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/03/24hour_review_times.html about the App Store getting better.</p>
<p>The iPhone version of Snowtape, in development for months, &#8220;was rejected&#8221;:http://www.vemedio.com/blog/posts/134 because it could let users record and share audio from the internet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;His sole words were, that there are lots of things missing in the SDK agreement and that they can not foresee any circumstance that leads to a denial of an app. That&#8217;s right! We did not violate any paragraph of the SDK, yet they forbid us distributing our app.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The developer removed the ability to transfer audio files off the phone and then Apple let the app through.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s this post &#8220;on the developer forums&#8221;:https://devforums.apple.com/message/190892 about an iPad app rejection because they recreated a UI innovation from the new Photos app. Apple said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The application uses a tap and a pinch to expand feature that is present in Apple iPad Applications. This action is associated solely with Apple applications, and we kindly ask that you update your app appropriately.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a bunch of iPhone and iPad development this week. The more I work with it, the more I love the platform. But it just takes a couple rejections to sour the whole experience.</p>
<p>And yes, I realize I&#8217;m posting this on one of the most exciting days in the history of the App Store. The first round of iPad apps hitting the store today look fantastic.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I noticed a couple tweets last month about fast, less than 24-hour review times for iPhone app submissions. After I tweeted it, a whole bunch of other people came forward with similar stories. Apps going from submission to ready-for-sale in 12 to 24 hours.</p>
<p>The App Store is still fundamentally broken in many ways, possibly beyond repair depending on who you talk to, but there&#8217;s no question that fast review times are great for developers. Even if the progress stops with this, it&#8217;s a significant improvement to the App Store process.</p>
<p>Is it just for established devs? Just for minor bug fixes? It&#8217;s not the latter, since some of these were brand new apps. The question is whether this was a change for a certain class of developers and apps or whether it represents an overall speed-up to the review process, and maybe even a hint at prepping for the iPad launch.</p>
<p>Review times are a big deal and they&#8217;ve gone mainstream. Opera Mini has a very public &#8220;count up&#8221;:http://my.opera.com/community/countup/ widget as part of their extensive pre-approval hype. You can tell from the demos that Opera put a huge amount of work into polishing Mini before submitting it, to remove as many potential objections as possible, and to get users excited before it ships. A high-profile rejection now would erase any goodwill that Apple has built up recently.</p>
<p>I know some developers are nervous with openly discussing or blogging about their relationship with Apple, but I think more people should follow Opera&#8217;s lead. By being vocal on the App Store&#8217;s strengths and shortcomings, we force Apple to be more transparent. Bad press has a proven history of leading to overturned rejections. The narrative of the last few months, to me, is that the App Store is getting better, and I don&#8217;t think it would be happening without the critics.</p>

			<p>With the iPad set to ship in just a week and a half, I&#8217;ve been quietly reshuffling some of my projects around it. I&#8217;ve written critically of the iPhone and App Store a couple times, such as how the iPhone is a gold rush distraction that &#8220;doesn&#8217;t need me&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/09/its_okay_to_ignore.html. I also stand by &#8220;earlier opinions&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/11/the_only_2.html of how unfixable the App Store is, especially now when it&#8217;s obvious that any effort trying to convince Apple to open the store is completely wasted. They never will.</p>
<p>But I really like what I&#8217;ve seen of the iPad platform so far and I think it represents a big shift for everyday computing in a way that a cell phone can&#8217;t. So I renewed my membership in the iPhone developer program.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on 2 apps for the iPad. The first is just a minor iPad refresh of an existing iPhone app at VitalSource called &#8220;Bookshelf Noteview&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bookshelf-noteview/id333263742?mt=8 (iTunes link). It&#8217;s for reading notes and highlights synced from our e-book platform.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not ready to announce the next app yet, but it&#8217;s a personal project which I had originally written for the Mac over a year ago. I shelved it at the time because I wasn&#8217;t sure there was demand, the backend web services weren&#8217;t mature, and I wasn&#8217;t ready to take it to completion. For the iPad though, it might be perfect.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s ultimately where I see the most interesting potential for the iPad. New middle-ground apps that we haven&#8217;t even thought of yet, not ports from another platform. Apps that would feel small or distracting or wrong on the Mac, yet equally oversized for a relatively underpowered iPhone. Maybe the never-tested-on-a-real-device launch day apps will be buggy and the overall quality low, but I can&#8217;t wait to try them anyway.</p>

<p>Will there be a &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ for iPad? I hope so. This platform will be the future for plenty of customers. Apple lived up to the hype not because of the hardware or distribution or anything entirely revolutionary, but because of the software. Splitviews and popovers. Keynote and Pages. These apps are just as competent as their desktop versions.</p>

			<p><em>I wrote the following before the iPad was announced. The world may have changed since then, but I&#8217;m posting it anyway. Enjoy.</em></p>
<p>I like the content but not the title in &#8220;John Casasanta&#8217;s blog post about the so-called death of Mac software&#8221;:http://www.taptaptap.com/blog/iphone-software-sustainability-and-the-death-of-mac-software/. He shares some great stats and lays out the case for why iPhone development is more appealing and successful for him, but that doesn&#8217;t make the Mac dead. What he really meant and says later is that it&#8217;s <em>dead to him</em>.</p>
<p>For those of us who love writing Mac software and who don&#8217;t feel the pull of get-rich-quick blockbuster apps, the Mac is alive and remains just as healthy as it was before the iPhone was announced.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not what I want to write about, though. The real question is <em>how do we learn from the App Store and expand the market for Mac software</em>. Compared to the iPhone, the Mac has a fragmented application discovery and an inconsistent purchasing experience.</p>
<p>When Keith Alperin and Rick Fillion &#8220;talked on the MDN Show&#8221;:http://www.mac-developer-network.com/shows/podcasts/mdnshow/mdn017/ about a possible Mac app store, Rick revealed some interesting numbers from &#8220;Bodega&#8217;s&#8221;:http://appbodega.com/ installed base: 80,000 downloads and 10,000 active users. They&#8217;re not 1.0, and I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with these numbers, but it&#8217;s not big enough yet to make an iPhone-like impact on how we buy Mac software.</p>
<p>What Bodega does have is a technology head start. &#8220;My products&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ have been listed there since launch, and they have a polished application and feature-rich backend for tracking releases and collecting usage metrics. The key is solving the chicken-and-egg problem of getting the Bodega app in everyone&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>There are two approaches: either get people excited about installing Bodega because it&#8217;s useful for updating existing apps (which it is), or sneak a copy of Bodega on to many more Macs (which is what this post is about). This solution isn&#8217;t perfect, but short of Apple building a real Mac App Store or a marketing giant like MacHeist getting involved, it&#8217;s the only idea I can see working.</p>
<p>First, start with &#8220;PotionStorefront&#8221;:http://github.com/potionfactory/potionstorefront. There are a few of these in-app purchase frameworks out there, but I like the &#8220;Potion Factory&#8217;s aesthetic&#8221;:http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/ and Potion Store is popular. The web service used to submit orders could be supported by other custom store backends, including Bodega&#8217;s own purchasing system when they have it.</p>
<p>On top of this in-app purchase foundation, you bundle a subset of the Bodega application discovery UI directly into the framework. Users can download and install demo versions of new apps without leaving the catalog. Think of it as a &#8220;lite&#8221; version of Bodega, streamlined to fit inside everyone&#8217;s app. You also include the full Bodega application so that it can be launched and optionally installed in the user&#8217;s applications folder.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;ve effectively done here is give everyone who buys a third-party app access to a new store where they can discover other apps. It&#8217;s compelling for developers because the more companies that participate, the wider their reach becomes. And it&#8217;s great for users because over time it starts to create a consistent user experience, and familiarity reduces the effort in buying Mac software.</p>
<p>Some tricky issues remain, though. You don&#8217;t want to distract users from buying their first application, or muddle that app&#8217;s branding, and you want to later encourage users to find or be notified about new applications without it looking like an advertisement. The challenge is in finding a balance that most developers would want to use.</p>
<p>Back to the iPhone&#8217;s success, from a post by &#8220;Guy English&#8221;:http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/67:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People, lots and lots of people, people who have no idea what software even is, will download Apps like they&#8217;re snacking on potatoe chips. What&#8217;s my proof? Well, two million downloads of an App in a week supports that and I&#8217;d argue that a total of three billion Apps downloaded backs up my argument too.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;ve never seen anything like it, and I&#8217;m really happy for my friends who have had success on the iPhone. Luckily, the iPhone and Mac don&#8217;t actually compete. The App Store can sell ten thousand times the amount of software as the Mac does and it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that Mac users need software too. It&#8217;s our job as developers to continue to provide solutions for users and help those users find us.</p>

			<p>I like &#8220;this article on Mobile Orchard about the relationship between price and ratings&#8221;:http://www.mobileorchard.com/app-store-heresies-higher-price-better-ratings-dont-discount-your-app-at-launch/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Customers with some skin in the game carry a psychological pressure to feel that they&#8217;ve been wise in their purchases; they&#8217;ll tend to over emphasize their positive feelings.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This makes sense to me, and the other side of pricing that&#8217;s so important is the message you send. The perceived value of a product is connected to the published price. This is especially true in the App Store, where there&#8217;s no way to try the software before purchasing it. The price sets expectations.</p>
<p>So to take the Mobile Orchard analysis a little further: no one feels guilty judging a free app harshly with a 1-star rating because <em>even the developer thinks the app is literally worthless</em>.</p>
<p>Sure, there are good reasons to have a free app. To complement another paid service or desktop app, as a demo for a game or full version, or to &#8220;make $125,000/month in ad revenue&#8221;:http://fingergaming.com/2009/12/02/paper-toss-developer-earns-125000-in-monthly-ad-revenue/. In fact half the ideas I had for iPhone apps would have been free. But I don&#8217;t think any of that changes the truth of what Mobile Orchard said, that free stuff isn&#8217;t respected as much as something the customer is personally invested in.</p>

			</h1>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I let my iPhone developer account expire last week. Even though I had already stopped development on my iPhone projects, officially letting go of even the temptation to build for the iPhone platform has really helped me focus.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Rogue Amoeba rejection for Airfoil Speakers Touch&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2009/11/13/airfoil-speakers-touch-1-0-1-finally-ships/ has been covered on Twitter and &#8220;at Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2009/11/airfoil_touch_situation, but I think it&#8217;s easy to get distracted by legal technicalities and not the heart of the matter: as long as Apple is the gatekeeper, there will be bad decisions and apps that deserve to be approved will be rejected instead. For this reason the App Store cannot be fixed with incremental improvements.</p>
<p>There are only two possible solutions:</p>
<h1>Accept all applications. Joe Hewitt, the developer of the Facebook application who this week also quit the App Store, &#8220;has written well on this solution&#8221;:http://joehewitt.com/post/innocent-until-proven-guilty/.</h1>
<h1>Allow applications to be installed on the phone without being listed in the App Store. Both Android and the Palm Pre &#8220;support this model&#8221;:http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/05/palm-free-apps-for-the-web-free-development-for-open-source-and-free-pres/.</h1>
<p>There is no third or fourth solution. There is no compromise or small improvement to the review process. Better transparency or tiered support options won&#8217;t help either. Without either of the above two changes, rejections will continue because in a subjective review process there will always be bad judgement calls. Some percentage of indie developers will abandon the iPhone either because the risk is too great or based on principle alone.</p>
<p>Let me take the second one (allow applications to be installed without being listed) because it plays directly to this Rogue Amoeba rejection. Rogue Amoeba is one of my favorite Mac companies, and Daniel Jalkut and I record &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ using their Audio Hijack Pro app. It&#8217;s universally regarded as great software.</p>
<p>It might surprise you to find out that Audio Hijack Pro is not listed in the &#8220;Apple Downloads&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/ site, though other Rogue Amoeba products such as Fission, Nicecast, and Airfoil are. I&#8217;m not sure Rogue Amoeba has ever spoken on the record about this, but Apple apparently doesn&#8217;t like the app and won&#8217;t list it. Maybe because you can use it to record copyrighted music? Who knows.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t matter because being rejected from Apple Downloads doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t make Mac software! It just means you have to market the software yourself. Rogue Amoeba has to work extra hard to get the word out about the app, but their business won&#8217;t fail just because Apple doesn&#8217;t give it their blessing.</p>
<p>This is so important for a small company. I want my software to fail because it sucks, or is buggy, or doesn&#8217;t have the right features, not because Apple can shut me down over a minor difference of opinion.</p>
<p>There are a lot of well-intentioned suggestions for improving the App Store, but the result will always be the same until we acknowledge the root problem. The only fix is for Apple to remove itself as gatekeeper, or let us route around them.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Forget the developer perspective for a minute. Even as a user I find the race-to-the-bottom iPhone price drops completely maddening. I&#8217;ve bought apps for $5 and $10, and now many of those prices have either been cut in half or lowered to 99 cents. I felt like I got my money&#8217;s worth at the higher price, so I&#8217;m not complaining that I was ripped off. Instead, I just feel like a fool.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve learned my lesson. The message from developers could not be more clear. Apparently the way to buy iPhone software is just to wait a month for the price to drop.</p>
<p>I realized this week that I don&#8217;t consider myself an iPhone developer. Technically I&#8217;ve paid my $99, but I&#8217;ve scrapped all my ideas except a prototype I&#8217;m working on for &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/, and even that I expect someone else to finish and bring to market. If I was an independent iPhone developer I&#8217;d be furious at the instability of pricing on the App Store. Even to users it looks like chaos.</p>

			<p>&#8220;Buzz Andersen responds&#8221;:http://log.scifihifi.com/post/47592954/heres-an-idea-i-could-take-my-newly-minted to some of Mike Lee&#8217;s recent blog posts:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re living in the &#8216;anyone can play guitar&#8217; era of software entrepreneurship. Because of the confluence of increasingly accessible developer tools and the Internet, it&#8217;s now reasonable to think that one or two talented people, with little to no investment, can make anything from a good living to a fortune by bringing their idea to life. What kills me about the outmoded Silicon Valley gold rush mentality that I feel has entered the Mac developer community for the first time because of the iPhone is how much it fundamentally ignores the significance of Apple&#8217;s App Store as a field leveler.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I was at first disappointed that I had no time (either at VitalSource or for my own projects) to have an iPhone app at launch, as the weeks and months pass since the App Store opened I find myself less and less sure about what the App Store market actually looks like. Everything is changing very quickly. While there is no doubt a huge opportunity in iPhone development &mdash; and with another 30-40 million iPhones hitting next year, each of those new customers will have their own impulse buys and novelty purchases, to say nothing of the real apps that people need on their phone &mdash; at the same time I wonder when iPhone development will be as mature and stable as the Mac software market is.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a direct comment on what Buzz is saying. His blog and comments on &#8220;Mike&#8217;s post&#8221;:http://www.atomicwang.org/motherfucker/Index/832D1CF5-BDF8-493D-945A-E95105682EDC.html are right-on as usual.</p>

			<p>I wasn&#8217;t going to give the silly $999 &#8220;I Am Rich&#8221; iPhone application any more attention after the initial laugh, but the more that everyone reacts to what went wrong the more clear it becomes that there is something to learn here. &#8220;Kottke thinks Apple shouldn&#8217;t restrict&#8221;:http://www.kottke.org/08/08/the-1000-iphone-app based on taste; &#8220;Ryan Irelan points to no shopping cart&#8221;:http://www.ryanirelan.com/blog/entry/the-1000-iphone-app/ as the problem; &#8220;Dan Benjamin mostly agrees&#8221;:http://hivelogic.com/articles/2008/08/regarding-iphone-application-pricing but with some more analysis; and &#8220;John Gruber hits the same points&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/08/07/i-am-rich and mentions (in passing) what I think is the real problem: refunds.</p>
<p>iPhone developers have wondered for months how refunds were going to be handled. Although demo and trial versions (if added) will be used by many more customers, refunds to unhappy customers represent an extremely important part of the relationship between developer and customer. I&#8217;ve written before about &#8220;my philosophy with refunds&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/customer.html and customer support, an opinion that is shared pretty universally in the Mac community. Just yesterday I gave a refund to a customer who purchased the software over a year ago, but apparently didn&#8217;t get around to actually using it recently and found it did not meet his needs.</p>
<p>If there were a proper way for developers to send App Store refunds &mdash; because of unmet expectations (app crashes or doesn&#8217;t work as advertised) or accidental purchases (my son bought this without asking me) &mdash; then this issue just goes away. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether I Am Rich is worth $999 or whether the shopping cart should be an option in iTunes. The core issue is refunds because it fixes several problems at once, and removes Apple&#8217;s personal judgement about what is good or bad for iPhone users.</p>
