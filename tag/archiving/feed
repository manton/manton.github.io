				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2015/09/11/aGoodDayToThinkAboutWebHistory.html">Dave Winer</a> on the continued disappearance of old web sites:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to sound the alarms. Every day we lose more of the history of the web. Every day is an opportunity to act to make sure we don&#8217;t lose more of it. And we should be putting systems into place to be more sure we don&#8217;t lose future history.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://stevenf.com/2015/09/09/http-is-obsolete-its-time-for-the-distributed-permanent-web/">Steven Frank pointed to</a> a new format and protocol called IPFS, which <a href="https://blog.neocities.org/its-time-for-the-permanent-web.html">Neocities is embracing</a>. Copies of your content would live in multiple nodes across the web instead of in a single, centralized location. From their blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Distributing the web would make it less malleable by a small handful of powerful organizations, and that improves both our freedom and our independence. It also reduces the risk of the &#8216;one giant shutdown&#8217; that takes a massive amount of data with it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I took some time to read through what it can do, and I&#8217;d like to support it for the publishing platform that&#8217;s in my new microblogging project. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s technically feasible yet, but I love that someone is trying to solve this. We just have to start somewhere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/a-eulogy-for-twitter/361339/">The Atlantic has an interesting essay</a> on whether Twitter is on a slow decline, less useful and meaningful than it once was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Twitter is the platform that led us into the mobile Internet age. It broke our habit of visiting individual news homepages first thing in the morning, and established behaviors built around real-time news consumption and production. It normalized mobile publishing power. It changed our expectations about how we congregate around shared events. Twitter has done for social publishing what AOL did for email. But nobody has AOL accounts anymore.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It reminds me of something I brought up on Core Intuition a few months back, wondering if Twitter is a core part of the web, something that would be with us forever, or if it is “just another web site”. When we get into the groove of using a new service for a few years, it’s easy to forget that web sites don’t have a very good track record. Giant sites like Facebook and Tumblr seem to have been with us forever, but my personal blog is older than both.</p>
<p>Think about this: if it’s even <em>possible</em> for Twitter to fail — not likely, just possible — then why are we putting so much of our content there first, where there are <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms">rules for how tweet text can be used</a>? Storage for all tweets is so massive that there’s no guarantee that other companies will be able to take over the archive if the service has to fold. It’s why I built <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a> to archive and publish tweets.</p>
<p>Decentralization is the internet’s greatest strength and weakness. There shouldn’t be <a href="https://medium.com">one service</a> to hold all of blogging; each writer should have his or her own domain and web site. But web sites also die all the time from neglect. We need centralized services to index and syndicate content so that it’s <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">preserved</a> and accessible to more people.</p>
<p>Longevity is the next great challenge for the web. All of my work on Riverfold apps is leading this way, from archiving tweets, to <a href="http://sunlit.io/">curating and publishing your best photos</a>, to <a href="http://searchpath.io/">indexing a copy of the text and HTML from your blog</a>. But I’m just one guy with a limited server budget.</p>
<p>It’s time for a new web standard — a metadata format and API that describes how to mirror published content. Maybe it’s part of <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">IndieWebCamp</a>? When I write on my blog, I want the content to flow to GitHub Pages, to the Internet Archive, to Medium. When I post photos, I want the content to flow to Dropbox, to S3, to Flickr. It’s not enough to backup or copy data blindly; the source must point to each mirror, and each mirror service must understand who the creator is and how to find the original data if it still exists.</p>
<p>Unlike a distributed platform that works at the level of raw data, like BitTorrent, this new system should work natively with well-understood common files: text, photos, video, and the glue (usually HTML, Markdown, or JSON) that makes a collection meaningful. Instead of yet another generic sync system, it’s a platform that understands publishing, with adapters to flow content into each mirror’s native storage.</p>
<p>If you accept that this is something worth doing, then every place we put our content must be classified as either an original source or a mirror. And this brings us back to Twitter. Because while I think the next 5 years for Twitter will be strong, I’m not convinced that it will last 50 years. Therefore, Twitter cannot be an original source of data; it must be just one of several mirrors for micro-blogging.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As 2012 was winding down, I was fascinated with LongPosts.com (built on top of App.net) and so used it to post some thoughts about Twitter archives. The site is gone now, so I&#8217;ve moved the text back to my weblog here, where it belongs anyway. The link to the ADN discussion <a href="https://alpha.app.net/manton/post/2143060">is here</a>. — future me, January 2016</em></p>
<p>One of the main goals of my web app Watermark is to archive and search tweets and ADN posts, so it was natural for me to implement support for Twitter&#8217;s new archive export format. I finished it last night and linked it from the Watermark account page this evening for all customers.</p>
<p>I had heard that Twitter&#8217;s export included a CSV version before I saw the actual files, so I started work coding an importer based on that, with the assumption that I could tweak it later. Once I saw a real tweets.zip, I had to throw out most of my initial work. The CSV files have two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don&#8217;t properly escape values using quotes, so a comma inside a tweet makes the files more difficult to parse.</li>
<li>They don&#8217;t include some essential Twitter metadata like the reply-to ID.<br />
I switched to using the JSON files and it&#8217;s working well. They&#8217;re JavaScript but not strictly JSON, so you just skip the first line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the ZIP archive can be fairly big, instead of uploading in a web browser I let the user choose the file via Dropbox. This was a nice opportunity to try out the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/chooser">Dropbox Chooser</a>. Then on the server I extract the files and load the data.</p>
<p>Dave Winer is <a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/uploadYourTwitterArchive">doing something interesting</a> with archives too. He&#8217;s started linking up other people&#8217;s archives on S3 — both the HTML view and the .zip file. I have a test Watermark account that I&#8217;ve loaded one of these into. It&#8217;s interesting to import multiple archives and have them all merged together and searchable.</p>
<p>For so long we&#8217;ve waited for access to our old tweets. In the meantime I&#8217;ve shipped two products around fixing this limitation, so it&#8217;s especially funny that Twitter finally rolls out archives <em>after I&#8217;ve stopped posting there</em>. (And of course I love that ADN has allowed access to your full post history from the very beginning.) Not entirely sure where all this is going to lead, but I agree with Dave Winer that new apps should be possible now.</p>
