				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I had to migrate the news blog section of the <a href="http://www.staple-austin.org/">Staple! site</a> from an ancient version of Movable Type (version 2.x) to Blogger. Even though Blogger has recently dropped features and seems mostly deprecated in favor of Google+, for this site there were a ton of existing users on Blogger. Upgrading just made sense.</p>
<p>However, what a file format mess. Export in Movable Type&#8217;s custom text format; import in Blogger&#8217;s Atom format. So first step is to find a service that&#8217;ll convert between the two, then manually fix up usernames so it imports properly. I exported, tweaked, and imported this file at least a dozen times before getting it right.</p>
<p>I was so frustrated because this wasn&#8217;t just accidental bugs. Developers made conscious choices that led us to this compatibility dead-end. They <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kellan/7354863752/in/photostream">bet against Dave Winer and lost</a> at a pivotal time in the development of blogging.</p>
<p>We had a format that was perfect for both blog syndication and as an interchange format between systems: RSS. Instead, some developers criticized RSS, then proceeded to create new products that have not been well cared for.</p>
<p>That is now part of their legacy. 10 years after blogging went mainstream, the end result of reinventing the wheel isn&#8217;t better software, it&#8217;s user frustration trying to get anything to work together.</p>
<p>This lesson keeps playing out, as if we&#8217;re doomed to repeat it with each new generation of file formats. Here&#8217;s this week&#8217;s post from Eran Hammer <a href="http://hueniverse.com/2012/07/oauth-2-0-and-the-road-to-hell/">declaring OAuth 2.0 a failed format</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The web does not need yet another security framework. It needs simple, well-defined, and narrowly suited protocols that will lead to improved security and increased interoperability. OAuth 2.0 fails to accomplish anything meaningful over the protocol it seeks to replace.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you have a choice, always pick the old boring format that works above the new hotness that is only theoretically better.</p>
