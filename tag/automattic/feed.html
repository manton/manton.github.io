				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/14/1382.html">Dave Winer has a good comment</a> for anyone questioning the web:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  So when they tell you they know for sure that the web is dead, or that everyone wants to host their blogs in locked-up silos, or that you can&#8217;t build a great open social net on RSS, you might want to lower your glasses down your nose and look out over the top and ask Reallly? Are you sure?? ;-)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing is certain in business. For every success, there are many &#8220;sure thing&#8221; failures.</p>
<p>I posed a question on <a href="http://coreint.org/241">this week&#8217;s Core Intuition</a> as we were talking about Automattic&#8217;s upcoming <a href="https://dotblog.wordpress.com/">.blog</a> domain name registration. The gist of it was: what is more likely to survive for the next 50 years, Twitter or .blog? Twitter is huge, dominating the news and seemingly unstoppable, but social networks don&#8217;t have a great track record. I&#8217;d put my money on a new top-level domain, both because of the vision of empowering users to control their own content and also because domains were designed to last.</p>
<p>Companies aren&#8217;t exactly <em>designed</em> to fail. But that is their default outcome.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve become quite the fan of WordPress and Automattic over the last year, since <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/thank-you-movable-type.html">finally switching</a>. WordPress still has some problems — mostly in self-hosted web admin performance, and the clunkiness of editing themes — but Automattic is a good company. Around web publishing and hosting, I think 2 platforms are going to last for decades: GitHub and WordPress.</p>
<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/interviews-matt-mullenweg/">There&#8217;s a great interview</a> with Automattic founder Matt Mullenweg on the Post Status podcast:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I had the opportunity to interview Matt Mullenweg about an ambitious project that included more than a year and a half of development to create an all new WordPress.com interface, both for the web and a desktop app. The project was codenamed Calypso, and we talked about many aspects of Calypso, as well as a variety of subjects that relate to it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>After listening to this episode, I&#8217;ve subscribed to the podcast. Looking forward to being a little more aware of what is going on in the WordPress community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last half of <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2014/05/episode-136-throwing-fits-and-leaving-platforms/">this week’s Core Intuition</a> serves as a follow-up to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/05/would_i_go_back.html">my recent blog post on Twitter</a>. Daniel tries to get at the business problems of not being active on Twitter. On the show I say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Me trying to make a statement, even if it’s insignificant, by not posting to Twitter&#8230; It wouldn’t mean anything if it didn’t cost me anything. If it didn’t have a cost, it would not matter.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>We also talk about Automattic raising money, blog software, and what that sandwich shop that Daniel avoids has to do with customer service.</p>
