				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The MDN Show episode 16&#8221;:http://www.mac-developer-network.com/shows/podcasts/mdnshow/mdn016/ reveals the winner of the MDN Community Award: a tie between Matt Gemmell and Jonathan &#8220;Wolf&#8221; Rentzsch, with Mike Ash as runner-up. Looking back on 2009 there should be no surprise over these top three. Matt has been sharing great code with the community for years and is now a fixture of the MDN podcast; Wolf started the successful C4 conference and won a Macworld Eddy for ClickToFlash; and Mike Ash has packed more technical information into a year of his weekly Q&amp;A series than would fit in many Mac programming books.</p>
<p>(This also seems like a good time to link to nominee Daniel Jalkut, who got &#8220;his own version of a community award&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/1074/payback-time last month.)</p>
<p>I had a tough time singling out a specific developer among a dozen or more fantastic people, many who I consider my friends. But for me it was an opportunity to reflect on something at C4 that I didn&#8217;t get a chance to write about earlier, and since he won anyway I&#8217;ll include the email I sent to Scotty here.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are so many worthy candidates for the &#8220;MDN Community Award&#8221;:http://www.mac-developer-network.com/news/mdn-community-award-2009-update-the-nominations-so-far/ &mdash; people who are helpful to the Mac developer community by writing books, blogging, and sharing code &mdash; but when I heard about this award I thought about leadership. My pick is Jonathan &#8216;Wolf&#8217; Rentzsch.</p>
<p>&#8220;A leader sets the tone and attitude of the community. For example, at the C4 conference when some attendees used the Twitter backchannel to turn against and openly mock a presenter, Wolf shamed the audience instead of glossing over or ignoring the event. It was a community course-correction and a reminder that Mac OS X developers come from many different backgrounds: old-school classic Mac programmers, NeXT developers, Linux and Windows users, even designers and web application developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The community went through a rough transition point migrating to Mac OS X over 10 years ago, and is in the middle of another transition to embrace everyone excited about the iPhone platform. What I learned from Wolf is that we should never be afraid to welcome &#8216;outsiders&#8217; to the community even if they haven&#8217;t yet caught up on the history and conventions of the platform.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I have nothing but great things to say about everyone listed on the MDN page. Congrats again to Matt, Wolf, Mike, and the rest of the nominees.</p>
