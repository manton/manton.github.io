				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of a renewed commitment this year to work on my web app <a href="http://searchpath.io/">Searchpath</a>, I’ve just rolled out a few improvements. A search engine like Searchpath needs frequent maintenance to keep running smoothly — minor bug fixes and behind-the-scenes work on queues and web crawling — but I also hope to catch up on new features that I’ve long planned for the product.</p>
<p>One marketing bullet I always had that wasn’t fully realized: “Also serves as a text backup for your site.” Searchpath now exposes links to download both the HTML for any stored page on your site as well as a text-only version of that page after Searchpath has attempted to trim out the navigation and other links. Hopefully this will help out any customers who might need to retrieve lost text from their site if their primary site backup failed (or doesn’t exist).</p>
<p>Searchpath is free to try and $8/month or $75/year. Setup is as simple as copy/pasting one line of JavaScript where you want a search box. You can <a href="http://searchpath.io/">learn more and get started here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dave Winer reiterates that <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/08/16/privatizingAndSocializing.html">we must plan now to preserve our online writing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “There were far fewer bloggers. Maybe thousands. Today there are millions. None of them are thinking about what happens when Tumblr or Blogger or WordPress or Facebook disappear. But come on — we almost know for certain that one of them will. Given enough time they will all disappear.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>These companies are only as strong and permanent as their leaders, and leadership doesn’t last. If you think it can’t happen soon, look at the new Digg. Although <a href="http://digg.com/archive">they want to export the previous content</a>, currently nothing from Digg’s 7-year history is accessible. Not by accident, not by catastrophic failure, but because no one at the new company cared to keep it around.</p>
