				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time in weeks, we had nothing going on this morning and could sleep in. After a late breakfast I worked on implementing a better trial for my new product, letting the <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/two-weeks-notice-your-business-model-is-wrong.html">business model advice I mentioned yesterday</a> sink in.</p>
<p>Ryan Irelan, who founded <a href="https://mijingo.com/">Mijingo</a> to create books and video courses for developers, <a href="http://ryanirelan.com/2015/07/24/mijingo-mistakes.html">wrote today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;One of my biggest mistakes in my first several months of running Mijingo full-time is that I was going too fast.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I probably needed to hear that. I&#8217;m increasingly worried about launching this new project either half-baked or too late, so I&#8217;ve been trying to ramp up the hours I dedicate to it each week. But I&#8217;m scrambling to quickly change fairly major aspects of it. It may be better to slow down to make sure I still have the bigger picture correct.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be traveling some in August, so that rules out releasing anything brand new before the trip. I&#8217;m thinking my focus leading up to that is to send this to the subscribers of my <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">beta announce list</a> first. Both the free parts and paid plans will be open as if it was a finished product, but it will just be limited to an invite-only group. Based on that feedback I&#8217;ll know how close it really is to shipping for everyone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2008/maclife.png" alt="MacLife" border="0" width="200" height="256" hspace="10" align="left" style="border: solid 1px lightgray;" /> Wii Transfer has a full-page mini-tutorial in the May edition of &#8220;MacLife magazine&#8221;:http://www.maclife.com/, as part of a section on connecting your Mac to video game consoles. I finally &#8220;picked up a copy&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/792260641 last night. It was certainly a nice surprise and seems to have brought a small increase in sales.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been wrapping up the next version of Wii Transfer, which hopefully smoothes over most of the rough spots in the current release. After sending beta copies to a few customers, I&#8217;m opening up a &#8220;new forums section&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/forums/ as an experiment in getting early builds out without a more formal public beta. (It&#8217;s not linked from the main site yet, but will be soon.) Every developer handles betas in a different way, but I like the balance Jesse at &#8220;Hog Bay Software&#8221;:http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/ has achieved between his released software page and the early builds and developer notes in the forums section, for those customers willing to dig a little bit below the surface.</p>
