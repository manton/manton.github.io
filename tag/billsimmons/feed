				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bill Simmons announced on his podcast last week that his new media site <a href="http://theringer.com/">The Ringer</a> will use Medium. He said they’ve been working with the Medium folks on it, although I don’t know if that means using existing features that are available to anyone, or if Medium has built anything custom just for The Ringer.</p>
<p><a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/bill-simmons-medium-underlines-platform-focus/">Digiday has a story</a> about this, and about the larger context of how Medium is doing and evolving:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “At one point last year, a former staffer said, Medium decided to move away from funding publications directly and instead fund initiatives meant to grow audiences in specific areas such as women in tech and the election. Last year, it closed down Re:form and Archipelago, a home for personal essays. Its remaining verticals have been roped into Medium’s effort to generate more conversation with readers, with tactics like prompts at the end of articles.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve written several times about how Medium is <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/silos-as-shortcuts.html">worse than your own blog</a> for building an audience, and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/evan-williams-on-indie-web-sites.html">worse for the open web</a> if it continues down the Twitter-like path as a centralized social network. But encouraging larger publishers to adopt Medium is good, because custom domains will come along for the ride. Owning your domain and URLs is the first step to owning your content.</p>
