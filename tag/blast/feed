				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I received two great surprises this week. In the mail came the 9th issue of &#8220;Animation Blast&#8221;:http://www.animationblast.com/, Amid Amidi&#8217;s magazine on the art and history of animation artists. This started as a smaller quarterly magazine, but the latest issue has grown to over 100 pages. It&#8217;s an extremely high quality, ad-free book. I think I placed an order for Animation Blast #9 <em>over 3 years ago</em>, and it was continually delayed due to Amid&#8217;s other responsibilities. No worries, though, because the book is beautiful.</p>
<p>The other related surprise was a new episode of the &#8220;Animation Podcast&#8221;:http://www.animationpodcast.com/. The last one was over 2 months ago, but again, the quality is so high and the information so valuable that it makes my day when a new one drops into iTunes. The 17 episodes so far, if taken together, represent a huge wealth of animation history, rivaling most DVDs and books in my collection. They are probably the only podcasts I subscribe to that I would archive to audio CDs to make sure I always have access to them.</p>
