				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My content is all on this blog or linked from it, but if you&#8217;re following RSS feeds or Twitter it&#8217;s not as obvious where everything is posted. Here&#8217;s a summary to clear things up.</p>
<p><strong>Microblog posts:</strong> Posted here and in <a href="http://www.manton.org/snippets.xml">a special RSS feed</a>. Also automatically cross-posted to <a href="https://twitter.com/manton2">Twitter</a> and App.net, with some occasional truncation.</p>
<p><strong>Longer posts:</strong> Posted here and in <a href="http://www.manton.org/rss.xml">the default RSS feed</a>. Also automatically cross-posted to Twitter and App.net with the title and link. Twitter cross-posting is handled by my upcoming <a href="http://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a> platform.</p>
<p><strong>Photos:</strong> Posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/manton/">to Instagram</a> and then copied here <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/blogging-your-photos.html">using this workflow</a>. They don&#8217;t show up in either of the RSS feeds above. They&#8217;re not cross-posted to Twitter.</p>
<p><strong>Timetable:</strong> Posted to <a href="http://timetable.fm/">timetable.fm</a> which has its own feed. Discoverable in your favorite podcast client.</p>
<p><strong>Core Intuition:</strong> Posted to <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">coreint.org</a>. I&#8217;ll usually post a link here on the blog for each new episode.</p>
<p><strong>All posts:</strong> Switching to WordPress brought a new global RSS feed, but I redirect it to the longer posts for now. There&#8217;s a new <a href="http://www.manton.org/everything.xml">everything RSS feed</a> which contains all posts: microblog, full posts, and photos. Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://thaterikperson.com/10-year-challenge">Erik Person wants to prove</a> Marco Arment’s claim that indie success just requires <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/654375561696047104">working hard for 10 years</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Proving whether he is right or wrong is pretty hard to do. Maybe it’s all hard work. Maybe it’s pure luck. Hell, maybe it only takes five years of hard work, and Marco just kind of sucks at it. Either way, I’m going to try to prove it. And not by convincing you with some incredibly efficacious essay. Rather, I’m going to start my 10 years of hard work today.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In a follow-up post, <a href="https://thaterikperson.com/ten-year-update">6 months later</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In the past six months, I’ve managed to change quite a few things. The biggest change was leaving my job at the end of May. After several months of trying to work on projects in the evenings and weekends, I decided it was necessary to go full-time on the projects if I wanted to see any real progress.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve subscribed to Erik’s blog and look forward to following his progress. I hope he blogs more often about how it’s going. If you look at <a href="https://marco.org/2011/08/">Marco’s blog even 5 years ago</a>, he was usually blogging every day. (By the way, “blog more often” is my advice to nearly everyone, including myself.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just noticed <a href="http://fsteeg.com/notes/owning-your-content-on-the-web">this blog post from Fabian Steeg</a> on the value of personal domain names:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  So the mere decision to use a custom domain for my blog many years ago made it independent of the actual hosting location (wordpress.com or self-hosted) and publishing system (wordpress or my own software). In a way I’ve been referencing a system for years that I only now created. Your own domain and URLs really give you a lot of control over your content, even if that content is actually stored elsewhere for years.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Strongly agree with this. Having your own domain will future-proof everything you publish.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/05/mediums-latest-intriguing-publishing-experiment/">Glenn Fleishman writes for Six Colors</a> about Medium&#8217;s subscription features that will let publishers charge readers:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It’s absolutely clear the revenue side is an experiment, and Medium labels it as such all over. There’s no guarantee it will work for its early partners or pan out in the long run. But it’s the only publishing option that combines so many things in one place without any over-the-top cost or commitment on the part of a periodical.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While Medium is certainly doing a lot right, and I still think <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/silos-as-shortcuts.html">it&#8217;s not a bad place to mirror content</a>, the &#8220;long run&#8221; Glenn mentions is really what we should think about when considering Medium. I have no confidence that Medium will last 5-10 years.</p>
<p>If my whole business was based on blogging, why would I trust Medium to control something so crucial? With iOS development, we have no choice but to use the App Store. Writing on the web isn&#8217;t like that, and voluntarily giving up both control of the publishing platform and 20% of revenue strikes me as very short-sighted.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m registered for the <a href="https://releasenotes.tv/conference/">Release Notes conference</a>, coming up later this year in Indianapolis. This will be the only conference I attend this year outside of another ticketless WWDC week. If you didn&#8217;t go last year and want to know more about it, check out the web site or <a href="https://releasenotes.tv/151-our-2-0-1/">listen to episode 151 of their podcast</a>.</p>
<p>One of my favorite blog posts on this site from last year was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/10/release-notes-2015.html">my review of the conference</a>, because I think it both described the conference itself and also captured that inspired feeling you get when you&#8217;re heading off to the airport and your head is buzzing with ideas. And because it&#8217;s a blog, where I allow myself to be informal, it also has the meandering narrative of the everyday — a stop for coffee, a conversation with an Uber driver. My memory of the conference wouldn&#8217;t be complete without those things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to visiting Indianapolis again. I may also look at flying into Chicago and taking the train down, then flying out. Sounds like some people did that last year, and I think it would make a great start considering the venue at Union Station. We&#8217;ll see if the schedule works out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twitter has lost some of what made it special for communities 5 years ago. I&#8217;ve noticed a few trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter’s 140-character limit and easy retweeting encourage and amplify negative tweets. Sincerity is less common. Everything is an opportunity for a joke.</li>
<li>Widely followed, long-time Twitter users don’t find the joy they used to when interacting with followers. Some have retreated to private Slack channels, at the cost of public discussion and approachability.</li>
<li>Developers have never completely forgiven Twitter for crippling the API. This doesn’t directly impact most users anymore, but it’s a backdrop that gives every new Twitter feature a tone of distrust. Progress is slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, blog comments have slowly been killed off over that same period. The rise of social networks, combined with the technical problems of fighting blog comment spam, pushed most bloggers to prefer answering questions on Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="http://beckyhansmeyer.com/2016/03/07/follow-up-the-nuances-of-online-discussion/">Becky Hansmeyer writes about</a> the intersection of these problems — that some Twitter users avoid public discussion, but most blogs no longer have comments to fall back on — by pointing to <a href="http://blog.bellebethcooper.com/online-relationships.html">a post from Belle Beth Cooper</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Belle’s post really resonated with me because it reminded me of something I think about a lot: when an ever-increasing number of blogs and media outlets are disabling comment sections, where do decent, thoughtful people bring their discussions? I only offer readers one way to contact me on this site, and it’s via Twitter. But what if, like Belle, you no longer use Twitter (or never did in the first place)?”
</p></blockquote>
<p>We didn’t realized how much we lost when we turned our backs on blog comments years ago. Just look at <a href="https://red-sweater.com/blog/181/the-cocoa-carbon-advantage#comments">one of Daniel Jalkut&#8217;s blog posts from 10 years ago</a>, which he and I discuss on an upcoming episode of Core Intuition. 53 comments! And they&#8217;re all preserved along with the original content. That&#8217;s difficult to do when comments are spread across Twitter and easily lost.</p>
<p>It’s time to take what we’ve since learned from social networks and apply it the openness of cross-site replies. That’s why I want to support <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/Webmention">Webmention</a>. As Becky mentions, <a href="https://www.civilcomments.com/">Civil Comments</a> look great too. I think we can encourage both in parallel: distributed comments like Webmention for sites that can support it <em>and</em> better centralized comments like Civil.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/blogging-your-photos.html">written about already</a>, I now post photos to my own site in addition to Instagram. I use the <a href="https://workflow.is/">Workflow app</a> to make this easier, automatically uploading a photo and making a new blog post for it from iOS.</p>
<p>Ryan Toohil has taken my rough workflow <a href="https://blog.ryantoohil.com/2016/03/owning-your-own-social-media-content.php">and improved it</a>, adding support for prompting for the photo title, fixing the photo’s orientation, and a better dynamic folder name based on the date. You can <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/c485d9227ed347c4b3aab2a94fb822d6">see his updated workflow here</a>.</p>
<p>I still have a lot to learn about using Workflow. It’s the kind of app that you can only really understand the potential for after diving in with a real problem. Now I find myself looking for more ways I can use the app.</p>
<p>I’ve also finally read Federico Viticci’s excellent <a href="http://www.imore.com/how-use-workflow-ios-when-you-dont-know-where-start">intro to Workflow over at iMore</a>, which includes this advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “When I was new to Workflow, visualizing the vertical flow of actions before building the stack was my biggest hurdle in getting started. I&#8217;ve since developed a habit that comes in handy every day: if I already know what a workflow should do at the beginning and at the end, I place the first action and the last one immediately on the canvas. Then, I only have to figure out how to go from Point A to Point B, dropping actions between those two as I play around with different ideas.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Federico has written many times about Workflow. He has an article about <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/publishing-articles-to-wordpress-with-workflow-on-ios/">using Workflow to post to WordPress</a>, and tips and example workflows in the MacStories Club email. His podcast <a href="https://www.relay.fm/canvas">Canvas</a> with Fraser Speirs also routinely discusses workflows.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The echo chamber. We only follow people who we already agree with. We only jump on the bandwagon of snark and ridicule when it’s already the accepted narrative, and thus safe to be part of the mob.</p>
<p>But sometimes you&#8217;ll find an area where you aren&#8217;t completely in line with the crowd’s opinion. There’s a topic that keeps coming up for which you have something to add. The default story is missing an important angle.</p>
<p>When you disagree, that’s what you should write about, and you should post it to your blog. 140 characters thrown against wave after wave of mainstream opinion tweets will be drowned out. A blog post isn’t a cheap opinion; it’s a statement that what you think matters.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cdevroe.com/15094/fits-and-starts-and-homesteading">Colin Devroe started microblogging</a> on his own site, with separate sections for statuses and photos:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I want to post content to my own personal site and not through closed social networks — because I want to keep control of everything I create forever. [&#8230;] This doesn’t mean that I won’t be posting to Twitter or Facebook or Instagram, but that everything that I post there will originate here on my site.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s the photos and their RSS feed that caught my attention. Others have done this too, but for some reason I rarely post photos here on my own site. I’ve stuck with using Instagram instead.</p>
<p>I need to change that. I do like the Instagram app, though, so I’m going to keep using it. I’ll just copy the photos over to my site as well, and I’ll use <a href="https://workflow.is/">Workflow on iOS</a> to help automate it. The basic steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>After posting the photo on Instagram, copy the caption to the iOS clipboard. This will be the title of the blog post.</li>
<li>Select the Instagram-edited image in the Photos app and run the workflow.</li>
<li>Workflow makes a filename based on the title, with some simple substitutions. Lowercase, spaces become underscores, and drop some characters.</li>
<li>Transmit gets launched and I confirm the upload to my own server.</li>
<li>Workflow creates a WordPress blog post with an img tag and the relevant metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not bad. You can <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/75265d33bcd64c4d8485b2644de7df17">see the workflow here</a>. I’ve uploaded a bunch of my most recent Instagram photos this way. I’m not sure whether I’ll go back and mirror all the old ones.</p>
<p>These photos live under a new <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/photos">Photos category</a>. I’ve excluded this category from the main RSS feed that I use for cross-posting, so they won’t automatically go to Twitter. You can continue to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/manton/">follow me on Instagram</a> if you prefer that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bill Simmons announced on his podcast last week that his new media site <a href="http://theringer.com/">The Ringer</a> will use Medium. He said they’ve been working with the Medium folks on it, although I don’t know if that means using existing features that are available to anyone, or if Medium has built anything custom just for The Ringer.</p>
<p><a href="http://digiday.com/publishers/bill-simmons-medium-underlines-platform-focus/">Digiday has a story</a> about this, and about the larger context of how Medium is doing and evolving:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “At one point last year, a former staffer said, Medium decided to move away from funding publications directly and instead fund initiatives meant to grow audiences in specific areas such as women in tech and the election. Last year, it closed down Re:form and Archipelago, a home for personal essays. Its remaining verticals have been roped into Medium’s effort to generate more conversation with readers, with tactics like prompts at the end of articles.”

<p>I’ve written several times about how Medium is <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/silos-as-shortcuts.html">worse than your own blog</a> for building an audience, and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/evan-williams-on-indie-web-sites.html">worse for the open web</a> if it continues down the Twitter-like path as a centralized social network. But encouraging larger publishers to adopt Medium is good, because custom domains will come along for the ride. Owning your domain and URLs is the first step to owning your content.</p>
