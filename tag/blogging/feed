				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a lot of weblogs. RSS is a great way to keep up with sites that update infrequently, or that aren&#8217;t popular enough to bubble up on Twitter with dozens of retweets. But the Mac and iOS community has grown so much over the years. I know there are many new writers who haven&#8217;t been on my radar yet.</p>
<p>Brent Simmons has posted <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/11/16/blogs_by_women">a great list of tech blogs by women</a> that I&#8217;m going through now. There should be something there for anyone interested in development or design:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I made a list of some blogs I already knew about, and then I asked my friends for more, and they totally came through.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The list grew to include over 50 blogs as suggestions arrived to Brent via Twitter. I&#8217;ve already subscribed to a bunch and look forward to discovering even more.</p>
<p>One of my favorite new blogs is the travel blog complement to <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/">Natasha The Robot</a>, which made Brent&#8217;s list. Natasha was recently <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3973-natasha-the-robot-murashev-joins-basecamp">hired at Basecamp</a>, runs the <a href="https://swiftnews.curated.co/">This Week in Swift</a> newsletter, and <a href="http://www.natashathenomad.com/">writes on her new blog</a> about working remotely. From a post about taking her laptop to restaurants in Europe:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The nice thing about this is that I get a really cool and inspiring office for a few hours &#8211; each cafe or restaurant has it&#8217;s own vibe, people, music and I don&#8217;t feel rushed internally knowing that I need to go back to my apartment or coworking space to actually work.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>When I quit my day job this year, it was partly so we could travel more without worrying too much about my work schedule, outside of when the kids are in school. In fact, just days after I finished writing my <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/2weeks">two weeks notice</a> blog posts, we went to Europe and started a private family blog about the trip. So I&#8217;ve been inspired by Natasha&#8217;s blog as she shares her experience working in different cities.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a theme you&#8217;ll find in many of the developer-oriented blogs on Brent&#8217;s list. Wanting to get better, learning something new, and then sharing it with everyone else. Take this advice from Becky Hansmeyer, who wrote a daily series of posts about what she learned building her iPhone app, one post each day while she waited for her app to be approved by Apple. <a href="http://beckyhansmeyer.com/2015/06/05/waiting-for-review-day-4-visual-style/">From day 4</a>, on design and color:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I think the biggest thing I learned in choosing colors and fonts for my app is not to get too hung up in making comparisons to other apps. I spent a lot of time looking at my favorite apps like Overcast and Tweetbot and thinking about the decisions the developers made, and as a result I wound up feeling like I had to make those same decisions. But that was stupid because my app is my own and is also designed for a much smaller market.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Or this quote from Kristina Thai, who wrote <a href="http://www.kristinathai.com/how-to-be-a-speaker-if-you-dont-have-any-experience/">a post about preparing to give a talk</a> for the first time:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;My presentation didn’t flow, it was jagged and very rough around the edges, but I kept at it, made some changes and it got better. And better. And even better. And then I practiced it in front of a couple of friends who gave me even more feedback until I was ready.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Kristina also gave a talk called <a href="http://www.kristinathai.com/writing/">Become a Better Engineer Through Writing</a>. You can get a sense of the talk by downloading the slides. It covers the value to programmers in keeping a private journal, why you might write tutorials for your site, and makes a strong case for blogging.</p>
<p>Blogging isn&#8217;t difficult, but it&#8217;s still not yet as easy as tweeting. By creating a blog, you&#8217;re making a statement that you <em>care</em> about something. As I go through <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/11/16/blogs_by_women">Brent&#8217;s list of bloggers</a>, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for: what does the author care about, and what can I learn from or be inspired by in their writing? Because the more diverse our RSS subscriptions are — the more varied the opinions in what we read and share with others — the closer it gets us to a strong, healthy community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Derek Sivers <a href="https://sivers.org/nowff">had a great idea</a>. We&#8217;re constantly writing about the things we care about and whatever we&#8217;re working on, but the nature of blogs is that posts are always falling off the home page. There&#8217;s rarely a single place to get the tl;dr summary of what someone is working on.</p>
<p>This idea hit home for me last week at Release Notes when several people asked how to sign up on <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">my microblog project announcement list</a>. I&#8217;ve linked to it several times in blog posts, but I didn&#8217;t have an easy place to point people to without asking them to dig through the archives. A /now page is the perfect place for that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Shawn Blanc <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/now">linked to his page</a> too, which reminded me to put my own /now page together. You can read mine here: <a href="http://www.manton.org/now">manton.org/now</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://medium.com/the-story/taking-medium-to-the-next-level-cb7f223fad86">Ev Williams announced</a> a batch of new Medium features recently:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;There’s always another level. Another level of polish and power in our product. Another level of breadth to our content. Another level of dialogue and discussion. And another level of progress. Today, we are announcing a slew of updates to bring Medium to the next level and in the process make it more powerful, more fun, more democratic, and more essential.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Those updates include new mobile apps, @-mention support, a publishing API, and editor improvements. There&#8217;s also a new logo. (I know they put a lot of thought into this, and it&#8217;s a strong idea, but to me the logo&#8217;s design is so clever it&#8217;s actually kind of distracting. A little more subtlety in how they&#8217;re using depth could improve future iterations.)</p>
<p><a href="https://red-sweater.com/blog/3079/mediums-new-api">Daniel Jalkut blogs about</a> what&#8217;s included (and what&#8217;s left out) in Medium&#8217;s new API:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;One of the most unique aspects to Medium’s API is the provision for specifying a <em>canonical URL</em> and <em>license</em> on a post being submitted to the service. The canonical URL refers to another web location that should be considered <em>the original</em>, or most authoritative version of a post, while the license designates whether the post’s copyright terms stipulate a post is sharable as public domain or under a particular Creative Commons license. These attributes together indicate that Medium expects and encourages users of the API to contribute content that is not intended to be exclusive to Medium.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>While <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/evan-williams-on-indie-web-sites.html">I generally think</a> the trend to centralized writing platforms is bad for the web, I&#8217;m happy to see these changes from Medium, especially the API and expanding custom domain support. Medium has grown very slowly and carefully. I expect we&#8217;ll see quicker iteration on these new features now that they&#8217;re officially out.</p>
<p>In the process of experimenting with Medium posting, <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/13/gettingInSyncWithMedium.html">Dave Winer shared his take on post title support</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;It seems they have arrived at what I think is the correct answer: posts can have titles or not, and the content system has to be prepared for either case. That&#8217;s where this blog was <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/07/iNeedABetterBloggingSystem.html">in 1999</a>, before other blogging tools and Google Reader pushed the world toward requiring titles. And then Twitter came along not having titles at all, and the intersection between all the kinds of blog-consuming environments became almost empty.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m very interested in this because <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">microblogging shouldn&#8217;t include titles</a>. While Medium is mostly traditional essays, clearly comments don&#8217;t need titles, and Medium&#8217;s quick-posting UI encourages short posts. I hope this approach will get more RSS readers to gracefully handle title-less posts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I was writing <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/08/2959.html">some documentation</a> this week, I kept thinking about what makes great marketing copy. 37signals used to say that <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Copywriting_is_Interface_Design.php">copywriting is a form of user interface design</a>. That&#8217;s true but I think there&#8217;s more to it.</p>
<p>The best products don&#8217;t just have marketing copy; they have a mission statement. They don&#8217;t just sell a tool; they sell a movement.</p>
<p>When I stare at my product wondering if it&#8217;s too confusing — if it&#8217;s too different, and tries to do too many things, to be immediately understood by new users — I try to remind myself that it&#8217;s an opportunity. Instead of simply explaining what I&#8217;m doing, how can I pitch it in a way that strengthens a community around the idea. Because dozens of bloggers can spread the idea more quickly and in a more meaningful way than I can by myself.</p>
<p>And unlike a one-way press release, a community is inherently two-way. Every mention of the idea is both marketing <em>and</em> feedback. Someone blogs about how they&#8217;re excited for the product, but also how they wish it had a certain missing feature. Someone in the press writes a review, but also with a pros and cons list.</p>
<p>This cycle means the product gets better. And if we&#8217;re thoughtful in that first approach to marketing copy, then every blog post, review, and tweet that follows is laced with a little part of our mission statement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dancounsell.com/articles/how-i-raised-120000-dollars-with-crowdfunding">Dan Counsell wrote a long post</a> this week about the planning and executing of Realmac’s crowdfunding campaign for Typed.com. It’s worth a read for the careful thought he put into it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I spent two weeks planning and building the entire campaign. I started out with the video as I knew this would be a huge amount of work and to be honest, it was also something I wasn&#8217;t entirely comfortable with doing. Every popular campaign I looked at had a half-decent and engaging video. I did a lot of research and it turns out the flow of the video should be something like this: Introduce yourself, talk about the problem, move onto the solution that you&#8217;re building, and finally finishing up with a direct plea asking for pledges.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The beta for Typed.com is well underway, and linked in Dan’s post is a support forum for users. <a href="http://community.realmacsoftware.com/t/first-impressions/13/21">This post by Realmac designer Elliot Jackson</a> especially caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We don’t have an API yet but this is something I’ve been enjoying playing with for shorter posts. My workaround is to send the content over a URL then decode it and use JS in the browser to fill in the form elements (tags etc).”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He details a way to send short microblog posts to Typed.com by using Drafts and Editorial. Check out the full post for his JavaScript and Python scripts linking these apps together on iOS. I’m really looking forward to Typed.com’s official launch.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://eggfreckles.net">Thomas Brand has changed his blog</a> to let short link-style posts essentially expire off his site, with no permanent archive:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;For the last five months I have been practicing a new way of blogging. Articles of reference receive a permalink with a link on my homepage and a link in my RSS feed. Quotations and comments are displayed in full on the homepage and in the RSS feed, but do not receive a permalink of their own. As I write, older quotations and comments are pushed down the homepage and lost from the site forever.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>And since that post may go away, I’ll quote a little bit more:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I feel like disposable blogging lends itself to a more carefree publication, not only for me but my audience as well. When you pick up a magazine, you don&#8217;t expect to have access to every back issue.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/03/28/silofreeIsNotEnough.html">Dave Winer has been working on</a> his own new blogging platform:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;There haven&#8217;t been new features in blogging in a long time. Where&#8217;s the excitement? It looks to me like there&#8217;s been no effort made to factor the user interface, to simplify and group functionality so the first-time user isn&#8217;t confronted with the full feature set, left on his or her own to figure out where to go to create a new post or edit an existing one.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the next 5 years of blogging are going to be a lot more varied than the previous 5 years. Medium-style UIs, Twitter-like microblogs, and of course traditional WordPress blogs, plus the work Dave is doing and whatever else people build as blogging takes off again. I&#8217;m looking forward to shipping an app that contributes something to all of this, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Daniel and I welcomed <a href="http://inessential.com/">Brent Simmons</a> on the <a href="http://coreint.org/160">Core Intuition podcast this week</a>. Here&#8217;s Brent on writing and the web as a guarantee of free speech:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The old web where I feel like more people saw the web as what I was talking about: as a unique and amazing invention in human history, a thing that can bring the 6 billion voices out into the open, to tell their stories and say what they&#8217;re going to say. That this thing is really something special, and it shouldn&#8217;t just be treated as a way for monetizing eyeballs and figuring out great new advances in interstitial ads. [&#8230;] We can&#8217;t lose sight of the opportunity this is. And if the story really is that the web exploded in the mid 90s and became a wonderful thing, and then stopped being that wonderful thing a little more than 20 years later&#8230; Then I couldn&#8217;t even bear that heartbreak.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hope you all enjoy the episode. It was great to have Brent on the show.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday you had lunch with friends or family and posted a photo of your food and location to Twitter. It didn&#8217;t matter much. You put it on Twitter and didn&#8217;t care that you didn&#8217;t <a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">have a copy</a> or didn&#8217;t post it to your own blog first, because controlling that trivial bit of content just didn&#8217;t seem important at the time.</p>
<p>5 years later, 10 years later, 15 years later. That lunch is magic now — a captured moment, something you wouldn&#8217;t remember and didn&#8217;t think to record elsewhere unless you keep a comprehensive private journal. Maybe it was the day before a significant event or on a trip. The true context is only revealed with hindsight.</p>
<p>I wrote this blog post because I wanted to follow up on <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/10/blogging-every-day.html">my post about blogging every day</a>, underscoring that seemingly unimportant events can carry great meaning later. Those common everyday activities that don&#8217;t seem noteworthy today? <em>That&#8217;s our life.</em> One after another, strung together for days and then years until we die. It&#8217;s the culture of the 21st century scattered among millions of micro posts. And it&#8217;ll be lost to time if we don&#8217;t curate it.</p>
<p>Yesterday was unremarkable only because we&#8217;re too close to it. Later we&#8217;ll understand that it meant everything. And if that&#8217;s true, let&#8217;s aspire to something greater than our content being sliced up and interspersed with ads on someone else&#8217;s platform.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Matt Mullenweg on <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/10/streak/">being challenged to blog every day</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I thought blogging every day would be a burden, but it actually became a great source of joy. It was more a shift in mindset than anything — every day I read things I think are interesting, share links with friends, have thoughts that are 80% of a blog post, and write a ton privately, it was just a matter of catching those moments and turning them into something that was shared with the world.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Whenever I get out of the habit of writing daily, it creates friction to get anything published. When you post every day, there&#8217;s no expectation that all posts have to be great. But when you wait too long, there&#8217;s an increasing feeling that the next post has to be perfect.</p>
<p>Tools that make writing effortless — like Twitter&#8217;s limited, fast UI — should be part of the next generation of blogging software. I think that&#8217;s going to be around microblogs. Just because traditional blogs initially failed to embrace microblogging doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t take that format back with better server apps and clients.</p>
<p>When people first started paying attention to Twitter, the criticism was that no one cared &#8220;what you had for breakfast&#8221;. But if you look at some of my earliest posts on this weblog, many are equally trivial. What appears unremarkable today — the first lunch you had with co-workers at a brand new job, the stop at REI to get a tent for an upcoming family campout, the missed flight on the way to a great conference — might carry important meaning in later years, looking back. It hurts the web to keep that <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/09/28/myManifestoForWebWriting.html">locked in a silo</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  “And for the past 1091 days, I’ve been journaling every single day — that’s about 3 years or 12% of my entire life. My only regret? I wish I started sooner.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>When I was younger, I had tried off and on to keep a sketchbook or journal, but it never quite stuck. Like blogging, or writing, or drawing, or anything you aren&#8217;t paid to do, it takes setting a routine. There&#8217;s always something more important to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://instagr.am/p/Kf0zpaCbwH/"><img src="http://distilleryimage7.s3.amazonaws.com/5931b2b29b9b11e1abb012313813106f_7.jpg" width="150" height="150" align="right" style="border: 1px solid darkgray; margin: 8px;" alt="journals" /></a> Then in 1998, I started a journal again with a renewed commitment. I filled a book from that day up until I got married. Then another book through when my daughters were born. Another for the first 10 years of their life, and my son&#8217;s. The travel, the big life moments, the election, the work. It&#8217;s not everything — sometimes the entries are every day and sometimes months go by with nothing — but it&#8217;s the stuff that matters, and the snapshots in time of little everyday things too.</p>
<p>I would be devastated to lose these books. Open the pages and it rolls back the years like a time machine, to a previous life full of small details that are priceless today. I&#8217;m writing the books half for my terrible fading memory, and half for my children, who will only care what these years have been like when it&#8217;s too late to ask me.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve recently started transcribing the handwritten entries into digital form. One page at a time, into <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a>, then exported as plain text. It&#8217;s a long and tedious process, but multiple copies are the only sure way to make something last.</p>
