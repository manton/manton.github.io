				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pretty hilarious <a href="https://medium.com/@padlet/an-honest-guide-to-the-san-francisco-startup-life-6df13d23689">guide to San Francisco startup life</a> from Padlet on Medium. Here&#8217;s just one small part:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Markets are chockablock with these desk+gym hybrids — standing desks, treadmill desks, cycling desks. This is why I feel bullish about my swimming desk idea — a big water tank with an infinity pool and a computer bolted on one side. Noise cancelling scuba masks, snorkels, and fins come as standard equipment.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been fascinated with Medium lately, and have cross-posted a couple recent posts <a href="http://medium.com/@manton">over there</a> to better understand it. Is it a blogging tool? Sort of. Is it a social network? Not exactly.</p>
<p>While you can follow other users there, I find that even with the 100+ people I&#8217;m following, the posts I see on Medium are almost exclusively popular essays written by people I don&#8217;t know. They&#8217;re recommended enough that they show up in Medium&#8217;s daily emails, or on the home page, or linked from other blogs I read. But it&#8217;s like if you signed in to Twitter and only saw retweets.</p>
<p>This may explain Medium&#8217;s design changes to encourage quick, microblog-like posts, in addition to full essays. Longer blog posts just aren&#8217;t written often enough to make for a meaningful social network.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, to not much fanfare at all because nearly everyone had already lost interest, <a href="http://ello.co/">Ello</a> shipped their iPhone app. Credit to them for attempting to build a new social network, because this is extremely difficult. But it seems to me that Ello is a bust. They needed a more compelling pitch than simply “no ads”.</p>
<p>(I’ve heard some people joke about Ello’s monospaced font, but I kind of love that about Ello. If you want to differentiate yourself, design isn’t a bad place to start.)</p>
<p>App.net was — and likely will be for many more years — the most successful attempt to compete with Twitter and Facebook. If they fell short, despite how many things they got right, how can another clone of existing social networks hope to do any better?</p>
<p>I wish I could cheer Ello on. Spend enough time clicking around on Ello and you discover a niche but fascinating community, full of beautiful art and photos. It’s just that after so many months, there’s still not even a mention of an official API on the <a href="https://ello.co/wtf/resources/feature-list/">planned features page</a>.</p>
<p>The next great social platform can’t be yet another centralized system. It has to be more distributed and more open even than App.net. It has to focus on writing and bloggers and embrace what is good about the web. Ello doesn’t do any of these things.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  “Medium is now the most Twitter-like service on the web, was founded and is run by one of Twitter’s creators, and answers most of the gripes that people have had about Twitter over the years.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>My gut reaction to this was that Medium creates more problems than it solves. <a href="https://medium.com/@manton/not-progress-over-twitter-e2615d929ed3">In a reply</a> on Medium:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Medium is really interesting, and beautifully designed, but it’s not progress over Twitter unless you’re annoyed about the 140 character limit. It’s still totally centralized, has no API, and works against wanting to host and control our own content. Basically a step back for the open web. (Although I think there’s real value in mirroring content here.)”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Medium also feels like it wants to be a desktop experience right now. It’s not optimized for mobile in the way that Twitter has been from the beginning. There’s good stuff happening there, but I want to see more tools that encourage blogging instead.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://realmacsoftware.com/blog/typed-indiegogo">Typed.com</a> from Realmac Software looks great. Set to launch later this year, crowdfunding for the project has already passed $67k.</p>
<p>Ben Thompson wrote recently about <a href="http://stratechery.com/2015/bloggings-bright-future/">how blogging has changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Twitter has replaced link-posts and comments, Instagram has replaced pictures, and Facebook has replaced albums and blogrolls; now Medium is seeking to replace the essay. None of this is a bad thing: literally <em>billions</em> more people now have a much simpler way to express themselves online thanks to the ease-of-use that is characteristic of any service that seeks to focus on one particularly aspect of communication, a big contrast to a blog’s ability to do anything and everything relatively poorly.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a good post, although I’d say that even if those changes aren’t “a bad thing”, they can have bad <em>consequences</em>. Medium is a beautifully designed site and there is some great writing published there. But if it discourages people from owning their own content and writing at their own domain name, then it is a step back for the web. The best use of Medium is to cross-post there, to expand your audience, but not as the primary location for your writing.</p>
<p>If you’ve read between the lines on my posts <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">about microblogging</a> and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/10/return-to-open-apis.html">open APIs</a>, you may have guessed that I’ve also been working on a blog platform, although (I think) of a much different kind than Realmac’s Typed.com. I believe we need more blog platforms, not fewer. Accepting that Twitter and Facebook are the only way to publish online is like collapsing all the publishing systems down to a couple centralized tools. That approach is convenient in the short term but ultimately bad for the web.</p>
<p>The best and most diverse writing on the web still happens on individually-owned blogs. It’s linked to from Twitter, but it originates on blogs. If you’re not blogging than your writing doesn’t have the reach, doesn’t have the permanence, doesn’t have the impact that it could have.</p>
<p>And 2015 is going to be great for blogging. I’m looking forward to trying Typed.com and also sharing some of what I’ve been working on. If you want an early heads-up, <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the announcement mailing list</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I use <a href="https://feedwrangler.net/">Feed Wrangler</a> as my RSS service, but I like <a href="http://blog.feedbin.com/2014/05/07/major-sharing-read-it-later-upgrade/">this quote from Feedbin’s Ben Ubois</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Twitter and Facebook are often cited as the reason for the decline in RSS usage. Where does content originate though? Right where it always has: on blogs and websites that probably have an RSS feed.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a great point. If you had to choose between only reading Twitter or only reading weblogs, which would you choose? Losing Twitter would be a bummer for a lot people, but losing weblogs would <em>decimate the web</em>. We should do more to strengthen weblogs and RSS because they are the foundation for so much of the most important writing on the web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s SXSW this weekend, and while I’m again not attending this year, it’s a reminder that today is the 12th anniversary of starting this blog. I took some time today to fix the categories and tags on about a dozen older posts. One of those was fun to rediscover, <a href="http://manton.org/2002/09/john_siracusa_has.html">linking to John Siracusa’s review of Mac OS X 10.2</a>. Here’s the part from John that I quoted:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “And forget about any truly forward-looking features akin to Copland’s saved searches or BeOS’s metadata-powered custom views. Put simply, the Finder, once the crown jewel of the Mac user interface, no longer seems to be a priority at Apple.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>That was September 2002. It feels like it has really taken until 10.9 Mavericks (with tags and Finder tabs) for that to change.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two great blog posts yesterday from Brent Simmons that I think are related, though I read one early in the day and the other catching up on RSS feeds late at night. First, <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/12/12/one_year_anniversary">on quitting his job</a> to work full-time on Vesper:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “A year ago I was a designer for an enterprise app I didn’t care about — or even like in the least tiny bit — and which you’ve never seen or heard of. That’s no way to live.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It reminds me, of course, of the famous Steve Jobs quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And then, <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/12/12/the_stream">Brent says about Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The 140-character stream is where things not worth saying, and not worth reading, thrive. It’s where things actually worth saying get over-simplified and then get lost, if they get said at all.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, do something you care about, write something lasting. The older I get, the more both of these resonate with me. And even though I haven’t posted to Twitter in over a year, I think I needed to read that post to focus back on this blog, where my writing should live.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>App.net started 10 months ago as <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal">a blog post</a>. I thought it would be interesting to look back on a few things I’ve written on my blog about the service as it has grown.</p>
<p><a href="http://manton.org/2012/08/appnets_great.html">August 12, 2012</a>, on the potential:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “In less than a month, they went from a mission statement video that seemed just a step away from vaporware, to following through on an API spec and then alpha version web site. They delivered.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://manton.org/2012/08/announcing_watermark.html">August 28, 2012</a>, when I launched Watermark with App.net support:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “You can now add an App.net account and it will download any posts from your friends, making them available for search. Watermark is already storing tens of millions of tweets, and I’m excited to start adding App.net posts to that archive as well.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://manton.org/2013/01/three_months_without.html">January 11, 2013</a>, with how and why I stopped posting to Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Over three months ago I stopped using Twitter. I wanted to make a statement — perhaps in an overly-dramatic way — that the developer-hostile environment that Twitter had evolved into wasn’t something I could support anymore.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://manton.org/2013/01/what_makes.html">January 21, 2013</a>, reacting to one use of the global feed:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “And that’s the really good news: if what makes ADN special is the people, then it’s because all of the people have something in common. They didn’t chose ADN by accident, or because it was the default choice. They chose it because <em>they wanted something better</em>.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://manton.org/2013/03/three_adn.html">March 25, 2013</a>, where I review 3 iPhone apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “In this post I’m going to briefly review 3 of the most popular iPhone clients: Netbot, Felix, and Riposte. You can’t really go wrong with any of these three apps.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://manton.org/2013/03/climber_for_adn.html">March 28, 2013</a>, about adopting the file storage API:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “There’s a lot of activity around App.net file storage right now. I think we’re going to see some great things built with this.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And of course I’ve said much more about this on the Core Intuition podcast. Episodes <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2012/07/episode-50-dont-get-too-attached/">50</a>, <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2012/11/episode-65-sensitive-to-security/">65</a> and <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2013/03/episode-82-did-you-get-this-at-poundland/">82</a> are probably good places to start.</p>
<p>If you’ve been thinking about giving App.net a try, you can <a href="https://join.app.net/from/dsyxykqtzx">use this invite link</a> to sign up for free. There’s also a great <a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/05/08/app-net-passport-for-ios-is-now-available/">new iOS app</a> that lets discover apps and sign up directly on the iPhone.</p>

<p>What I finally realized is that I have to be serious about posting <em>every single day</em>. If even one day slips by, the whole thing breaks down and I’ll fall back into ignoring it, because there’s the added friction of wanting to post something “great” to make up for the missed days.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to <a href="http://www.manton.org/rss.xml">the RSS feed</a>, you’ll notice that I’ve now been posting once or twice every day for about a week and a half. I don’t link to all of these posts from App.net, so here’s the recent ones you might have missed:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/app_store_old_app.html">App Store old app maintenance</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “But if apps are an art form, an important part of our culture, then it shouldn’t require so much work to make sure they don’t disappear forever, so quickly.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/smartphone.html">Smartphone religion</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I got into the Mac in the 1990s during the lead-up to Apple’s certain doom, so I spent quite a lot of time arguing with Windows users.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/moving_off.html">Moving off SendGrid</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “So it’s a good time to move away, to a company that I can pick based on merits and attitude and not just because it was the default choice.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/no_new_apple_products.html">No new Apple products yet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Apple’s aggressive releases add even more anxiety about updating apps to keep up with the latest APIs and hardware.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/start_small.html">Start small</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It’s a reminder to me that great things can start small, unambitious. I never would’ve guessed that a web comic artist starting so plainly would later produce a single strip that’s so incredible.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/three_adn.html">Three ADN clients for iPhone</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “In this post I’m going to briefly review 3 of the most popular iPhone clients: Netbot, Felix, and Riposte. You can’t really go wrong with any of these three apps.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/little_outliner.html">Little Outliner</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Yesterday Dave Winer and Kyle Shank launched Little Outliner, an impressive JavaScript outliner that uses HTML5 local storage.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/apple_and_the_impression.html">Apple and the impression of being small</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “But too many voices also creates noise, and noise makes simple things messy, confusing. Apple still gives the impression of being smaller than they really are because our view of them is heavily filtered.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/ios_text_cursor.html">iOS text cursor swipe</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “While I was writing my review of ADN clients, I wondered aloud if Riposte or Felix or some other app entirely was the first to support swiping to move the text cursor. It seems a nice enough trick that someone should get credit for trying it first.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/icloud_sync_narrative.html">iCloud sync narrative</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Pretty sure we hit a tipping point in the <em>iCloud just doesn’t work</em> narrative this week. Whether that judgement is fair or not, Apple should drop everything to focus on making iCloud totally robust in time for WWDC.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/climber_for_adn.html">Climber for ADN</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Toward the end of this week’s Core Intuition, we talked a little about the App.net file storage API and mentioned the new iPhone app Climber.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/register_a.html">Register a domain name</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Using Facebook or Twitter or LinkedIn exclusively for your content is like an artist who picks their own colors but still stays within the lines of a paint-by-numbers kit. A domain name is your own canvas.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/hotline_servers.html">Hotline servers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “This article from Macworld is important because it will serve as a sort of Hotline software ‘about page’ for future internet searchers.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/searchpath.html">Searchpath invoices and automation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Then life and other work got in the way, and weeks later I still hadn’t shipped it. I wanted it to be completely perfect and automated, so that I never had to think about it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I also got tired of the non-retina (and outdated tag-line) of the old header. I’ve started over with a plain blog design, finally dropping HTML tables for layout (!) in favor of Bootstrap CSS. A more complete new design will follow later.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I’m happy to announce my new web app: <a href="http://searchpath.io/">Searchpath</a>. It’s search for your web site or blog with an innovative “popover” UI. Simple, fast. With better control of your search results, and no need to link to Google or show ads to your readers.</p>
<p>There are so many sites out there that don’t have search, or have very poor search. I wanted to build something that makes setting up a great search box on your site absolutely trivial.</p>
<p>Searchpath knows about blogs — it finds the text on your page to index, and can automatically strip out redundant titles from posts for clearer search results. It tracks popular search terms. It gives you more control, by letting you exclude archive pages and customize the font and links with CSS.</p>
<p>I’m running it now on this blog. Check it out in the sidebar, or visit <a href="http://searchpath.io/">searchpath.io</a> to sign up and try it on your own site.</p>
