				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been some good commentary on &#8220;Sergey Brin&#8217;s interview&#8221;:http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/15/web-freedom-threat-google-brin with the Guardian. It&#8217;s probably best summarized in &#8220;John Gruber&#8217;s comment&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/15/google-open-web:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The assumption here is that the only way to search is through Google, and that the &#8216;open Internet&#8217; is only what Google can index and sell ads against.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This resonates with me because I think Google has put enough ads on the internet. It&#8217;s impossible to take anything Google says at face value if they talk of &#8220;open&#8221; but their intentions say &#8220;ads&#8221;. But here&#8217;s the thing: Brin is actually right. There <em>is</em> great data hidden behind apps that should be indexable.</p>
<p>In the race to win the App Store, we forgot about the web. Think about Instagram. Millions of photos are being shared that are inaccessible via a search engine. These photos can&#8217;t be found again and aren&#8217;t discoverable. When you search the web, how does it make sense that public photos on Flickr show up, but public photos on Instagram do not?</p>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t have to choose between Apple&#8217;s closed systems and Google&#8217;s ad-driven business. I want to talk about improving the web without automatically being pro-Google. &#8220;This tweet from John Marstall&#8221;:https://twitter.com/iconmaster/status/191901693527605248 made me realize it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;d prefer to separate &#8216;indexable&#8217; from &#8216;indexable by Google.&#8217; Yes, they&#8217;re mostly the same for now. Might not always be.&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>We need competition in web search. More than Bing. A new search engine is the number 1 item from &#8220;Paul Graham&#8217;s frighteningly ambitious ideas&#8221;:http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The best ideas are just on the right side of impossible. I don&#8217;t know if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be. Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and recently I&#8217;ve noticed some cracks in their fortress.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s crazy, but so was the 1st search breakthrough, lightning-fast AltaVista, and so was the 2nd major innovation, Google itself. It&#8217;s time for a search engine that isn&#8217;t all about ads. It&#8217;s time for search that understands apps and embraces data from web services as much as it does from web sites. It&#8217;s time for the 3rd act in search.</p>
