				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s Sunday before day 1 of WWDC 2006. &#8220;Willie&#8221;:http://www.angrylearner.com/ and I took a walk this afternoon, down Market Street to the bay, following the water around to Pier 39, then up Lombard and meandering through quiet San Francisco back streets until we come through the middle of Chinatown and back to the hotel. Along the way I recorded some pieces of audio, hoping I could use them for a podcast I&#8217;m preparing about the city. Willie snapped pictures, almost all of which came out looking really good. I like &#8220;this one of me&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/willie/208562868/in/set-72157594226958432/ trying to get the sound from underneath the cable car track.</p>
<p>I accidentally left the MiniDisc recorder going for a part of our trek, wasting a bunch of disc time. The UI is so bad on these devices that I don&#8217;t know how to cut out just part of a track, so I went off searching for a new disc. Over lunch Daniel Steinberg had showed me his &#8220;M-Audio&#8221;:http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/MicroTrack2496-main.html, which I had considered earlier and now pretty much regret not purchasing. Maybe I&#8217;ll eBay the MiniDisc recorder at some point.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning is the keynote.</p>
