				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone who builds blogging software should have a blog. Everyone who builds podcasting software should probably have a podcast, too. (And sometimes, like for Marco Arment, even <a href="http://atp.fm/">a</a> <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar">few</a> <a href="https://www.relay.fm/topfour">podcasts</a>.)</p>
<p>So I was happy to see <a href="http://supertop.co/">Supertop</a> start a podcast recently to talk about the Castro 2 launch and other thoughts on being a 2-person indie shop. <a href="https://castro.fm/episode/HaPv6C">Episode 3</a> features Brent Simmons:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Pádraig and Oisín are joined by Brent Simmons to discuss indie app development in the wake of Vesper shutting down.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One subject I&#8217;m glad they touched on is the special challenge for a company that needs to support multiple salaries, but isn&#8217;t big enough yet to actually have significant revenue like a large company. <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/08/episode-247-maybe-there-is-hope/">Last week</a>, Daniel and I talked about the balance of loving being independent but also knowing that one day you want to expand to support a small team. It&#8217;s not easy.</p>
