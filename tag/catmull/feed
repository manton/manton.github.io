				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Need something to listen to on your iPod while waiting in line to vote today? Try out these fantastic recent episodes of two of my favorite podcasts for animators and animation fans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spline Cast with Ed Catmull&#8221;:http://splinedoctors.blogspot.com/2007/11/original-spline-doctor.html. I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;ve followed the careers of John Lasseter and Steve Jobs a lot closer than I have for Ed Catmull, but this podcast shows pretty clearly the depth of impact Ed Catmull has had on the computer industry and the Pixar culture. It&#8217;s a great listen not just for anyone who cares about animation, but also for entrepreneurs who want a look into how you stay successful year after year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Animation Podcast with James Baxter&#8221;:http://animationpodcast.com/archives/2008/02/04/james-baxter-part-one/. There are many great animators, from well known independents who receive Oscar recognition to those who work 12-hour days in relative obscurity at a big studio, but there are only a handful of true masters of the art form. Baxter is one of my favorites. The powerful sequence with Moses and the burning bush and the mannerism of Belle fixing her hair were both always really memorable for me.</p>
<p>Enjoy! Happy Super Tuesday.</p>
