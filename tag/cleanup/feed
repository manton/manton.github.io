				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Smith has <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2016/09/06/app-store-name-lengths/">an analysis of long names in the App Store</a>, as developers try to understand the scope of Apple&#8217;s upcoming <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/09/app-store-cleanup.html">cleanup changes</a>. Don&#8217;t miss the text file of 255-character names he found, which are all ridiculous. I&#8217;d laugh if this kind of gaming of the store didn&#8217;t make me sad.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always thought that the title shown in the App Store should be the actual app name. Keyword spamming is clearly bad, but I personally don&#8217;t like even tag lines in the name. Of the 4 apps from my company <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">Riverfold</a> that have been in the App Store, the names in the store all exactly match what is shown on your home screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunlit</li>
<li>Tweet Library</li>
<li>Clipstart</li>
<li>Watermark Mobile</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe my sales suffered because of my refusal to add more words after the real name, but to me, these names are pure and gimmick-free. I don&#8217;t want my customers subjected to a truncated mess of words even before they use my app.</p>
<p>If tag lines and brief descriptions in the App Store name are so common (and they are), then Apple should complement the new 50-character limit by having a separate 1-line description field in search results. This was discussed on the <a href="https://releasenotes.tv/173-wont-get-fooled-again/">latest episode of Release Notes</a>. My worry is that Apple attempts to fight problems with new policy alone instead of also encouraging the right behavior with App Store features.</p>
