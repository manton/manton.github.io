				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/06/10/how_not_to_crash_9_mindset">9th essay about avoiding crashes in your code</a>, Brent Simmons writes about learning to be even less clever:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;But over the years I’ve come to think that I should write code that’s about 10% as clever as I am. And I’ve come to believe that true cleverness is in making code so clear and obvious that it looks like nothing at all.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m in San Francisco for WWDC this week, but without a ticket again. I took some time this afternoon — miles away from the hotel and Moscone — to reflect on what I&#8217;m doing here and what I need to do next. I&#8217;ve been to WWDC many times; my first was in 1996. And it has taken almost all of those years for me to understand the truth of Brent&#8217;s statement about being clever.</p>
<p>I also believe that a programming language can either encourage or discourage clever code based on the syntax it allows. I saw it with Ruby — programmers intent on fitting as much logic into a single line of code as possible. I think I see it with Swift as well, in operator overloading and maybe even a kind of rejection of Objective-C&#8217;s notorious verbosity. We&#8217;ll know for sure if we eventually see a Swift book in the pattern of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>.</p>
