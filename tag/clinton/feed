				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Democratic National Convention starts today and the latest round of polls are out. <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/#now">FiveThirtyEight&#8217;s polls-only estimate</a> of the election now shows Trump in the lead. Just in case you think we can not vote or not volunteer, and Hillary will coast to a win anyway&#8230; we can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>As a long-time Hillary supporter — I <a href="http://www.manton.org/2008/02/hillary_podcast.html">recorded a podcast episode</a> about the primary process back in 2008, which I&#8217;m still very proud of — I&#8217;m increasingly frustrated to realize how much damage has been done with the constant attacks against her character over 20 years. She&#8217;s held to a different standard of perfection than everyone else. But she&#8217;s a very good candidate and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-honest-transparency-jill-abramson">fundamentally honest</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not forget how historic this election is. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/opinion/campaign-stops/behind-hillarys-mask.html">From a New York Times profile</a> by Gail Collins:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  You can argue the pros and cons of Hillary Clinton’s character, or her potential to change the nation, or her position on trade policy. But you can never take away the fact that she was the one who made the idea of a woman becoming president so normal that many young women are bored by it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If Hillary wins, future generations will grow up learning about how Republicans (and even some Democrats) threw everything at her for decades, and she never gave up on politics. Success isn&#8217;t just the best ideas, the best product, the best marketing. Success is perseverance.</p>
<p>There are many people alive today who were born before women had the right to vote. Trump is wrong about what makes America &#8220;great&#8221;. The country is great because it is progressive, even if progress takes a long time. Electing the first woman president isn&#8217;t supposed to be easy. Hillary is a strong Democrat, and her place in history is worth fighting for and celebrating.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Iowa kicks off the election today, I thought I’d offer my 2 cents on the campaign. I&#8217;m a strong Hillary Clinton supporter.</p>
<p><a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/30/0958.html">Dave Winer writes</a> that Hillary is what we need right now in terms of projecting a stable image to the rest of the world:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “At this moment, we need a solid hitter, someone who the rest of the world is comfortable with, and who a deeply injured Republican Party can work with.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see the passionate Bernie Sanders supporters, too. I was fired up for Howard Dean in 2004, so I remember what that excitement is like. But I believe Hillary would be a great president.</p>
<p>Eight years ago I put together a short podcast episode about the campaign, trying to capture something from 2008. You can <a href="http://www.manton.org/2008/02/hillary_podcast.html">listen to it here</a>. My daughters — who were 7 years old at the time — make an appearance at the end of the episode. Now, of course, they’re 15, and the weight of time passing couldn&#8217;t be more clearly felt.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good line from Hillary in one of the first Democratic debates in 2015:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I&#8217;m a progressive. But I&#8217;m a progressive who likes to get things done.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that sums up what we can expect from a Hillary Clinton presidency. I have no idea what a Bernie Sanders presidency would look like — what it would accomplish — and I&#8217;m not sure he does either. My concern isn’t in the ideas, but in the execution against a politically calculating, Republican congress.</p>
<p>Bernie and Hillary share something in a fighting attitude, though. Neither candidate will let the Republicans walk over them. If you don’t think Hillary’s got this, re-watch <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?280557-17/senator-hillary-clinton-2008-convention-speech">her speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention</a>.</p>
