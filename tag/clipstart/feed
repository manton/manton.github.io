				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://devmate.com/mac-dev-survey">DevMate surveyed 679 Mac developers</a> to put together a report on who is using the Mac App Store vs. selling direct, what concerns developers have, which tools they use, and more. On why developers leave the Mac App Store:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If you’re thinking giving away 30% of your hard-earned revenue is the deal-breaker, you’d be surprised. Revenue share is not the main reason developers flee. The main reason is the long and unclear App Review process, closely followed by revshare and the absence of trial versions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While sandboxing does show up on the complaint list, it’s ranked low as a reason to not use the Mac App Store, even though <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html">it was why</a> I pulled my app Clipstart from the Mac App Store 4 years ago. And not much has changed since I wrote about Sketch and other apps leaving the Mac App Store <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/12/too-late-to-save-the-mas.html">last year</a>.</p>
<p>For anyone who has been following blog posts and conference talks about the Mac App Store, there won&#8217;t be many surprises in this new survey, but I found the details interesting. The survey appears to be a good snapshot of how the Mac community is feeling about selling software.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard <a href="http://blog.sketchapp.com/post/134322691555/leaving-the-mac-app-store">the news about Sketch</a>. I found this section of their announcement the most interesting, because it highlights that this isn&#8217;t just about technical and strategic problems with the Mac App Store, but also about having a direct relationship with the customer to provide the best experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Over the last year, as we’ve made great progress with Sketch, the customer experience on the Mac App Store hasn’t evolved like its iOS counterpart. We want to continue to be a responsive, approachable, and easily-reached company, and selling Sketch directly allows us to give <em>you</em> a better experience.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Sketch joins <a href="https://dancounsell.com/articles/not-on-the-mac-app-store">a growing list</a> of apps unavailable in the store. From <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/12/01/sketch-leaves-mac-app-store">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Sketch isn’t the first big name professional app to be pulled from the Mac App Store (Bare Bones Software’s <a href="http://www.barebones.com/store/macappstore.html">BBEdit</a>, Panic’s <a href="https://panic.com/blog/coda-2-5-and-the-mac-app-store/">Coda</a>, <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/11/24/quicken-2015-switches-from-mac-app-store-to-direct-updates/">Quicken</a>, just to name a few). But Sketch is the poster child for Mac App Store era professional Mac software. It’s the sort of app Apple might demo in a keynote — and the winner of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-2012-apple-design-award-winners/">an Apple Design Award</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/sketch-is-leaving-the-mac-app-store/">Federico Viticci writes</a> that Apple has to do something:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The simple reality is that, gradually, developers of the best apps for OS X are finding it increasingly hard to justify doing business on the Mac App Store. I hope Apple also sees this as a problem and starts doing <em>something</em> about it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Daniel and I talked about this <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/11/episode-207-pretty-please-apple/">on Core Intuition recently</a>. Developers have been complaining about the Mac App Store for years without seeing any progress. It was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html">over 3 years ago</a> that I pulled my app Clipstart from the Mac App Store to sell direct-only instead, because of my concerns about adapting to sandboxing.</p>
<p>All this time, Apple could have been iterating on the Mac App Store, improving sandboxing entitlements, improving review times, customer interaction, and more. Yet they have not. At this point, Apple can&#8217;t just do &#8220;something&#8221;. They can&#8217;t just improve the Mac App Store a little. They have to <em>significantly</em> improve it, addressing many issues at once. And even then, some of these great apps — Sketch, BBEdit, Coda, RapidWeaver — may not come back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I worked on some bug fixes to one of the new apps I hope to ship for Riverfold Software. I have just a handful of beta users, but got some good feedback and bug reports last week, things I want to address before opening it up to more users.</p>
<p>When I think of the in-progress apps that I can ship soon to help increase revenue, there are really only 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clipstart 2.0, which will be renamed Sunlit for Mac, to complement the iPhone version.</li>
<li>Unannounced microblogging-related web app, which may also come with iPhone and Mac apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with Sunlit for Mac is that I’m requiring 10.11 El Capitan. So no matter how much progress I make on it, I can’t ship it until Apple releases their next version of Mac OS X. I want to chip away at the new features, but I can’t spend all of my time on it yet. I need to focus attention on projects that have a chance of bringing in additional revenue in the very near future, not by the end of the year.</p>
<p>So the microblogging app — the one I worked on tonight — keeps coming to the front. Since it’s mostly a web app, it has the least number of external API and App Store dependencies that would hold it up. I can ship the core functionality whenever it’s ready. The sooner I get it out the door, the sooner I’ll know if it’s something I can count on as business income.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sixcolors.com/2014/10/taking-apples-lead/">Jason Snell writes about some of the inconsistencies in Mac OS X 10.10 Yosemite</a>, such as how only a few of Apple&#8217;s own apps use the new combined title bar / toolbar style:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;It makes me wonder if Apple was initially enthusiastic about this approach, then realized it wasn’t applicable to many situations, and rather than abandoning it just decided to live with the inconsistency. There’s certainly no clear, this-is-the-future signal.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t hate the new style, but that does seem like the fundamental problem with it: it can&#8217;t possibly be used for all apps, especially those with lots of toolbar buttons. I considered it for the next version of <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart</a>, but it&#8217;s not really a compelling enough change to risk breaking things that already work well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/05/clipstart_142.html">everything I said</a> about how easy it would be for customers to upgrade from the Mac App Store version of Clipstart to the direct download version, in the real world this doesn&#8217;t appear to be working well for some customers. Might be a little buggy, and it&#8217;s too late to fix anything in the Mac App Store. So I&#8217;m doing upgrades the old-fashioned way, giving everyone new serial numbers.</p>
<p>After the first few emails came in, I automated this with <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/upgrade/">a simple form</a> that customers can fill out. It&#8217;ll give them a new serial number right away and email the registration information. I&#8217;ve added a link in the FAQ on the <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart home page</a> too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gabe at Macdrifter comments on <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/07/1password-on-the-mac-app-store/">the shift back to direct download for 1Password</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I recall the <a href="http://forum.agilebits.com/index.php?/topic/8048-1password-only-from-app-store/">massive forum discussion</a> about the decision to take 1Password MAS only. I converted to the MAS version in March to get on-board with their product roadmap. Now I see that <a href="https://agilebits.com/store">it is available again as a direct download purchase</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/roustem">@roustem</a> confirms it will <a href="https://twitter.com/roustem/statuses/224965704015810560">receive the next update soon</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve never liked the idea of being exclusive to the Mac App Store. I don&#8217;t think any of those transitions — from 1Password to Pixelmator — were good for users, especially when customers had to re-purchase a product they already owned. I hope sandboxing will at least make more developers think twice about pinning their business to the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>The blog post continues with this point, and all the good and bad that comes with it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;This is the MAS as I see it: It is not for utility apps or power users. Apps like 1Password, TextExpander and Keyboard Maestro should all be purchased directly from the developers site. The MAS is for people afraid of using a computer.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words: it&#8217;s good for some users and some apps, and not others. And that&#8217;s okay. I have no regrets about pulling <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart</a> from the Mac App Store. I think of my app as pretty easy to use, but it&#8217;s for people who get file systems and tagging and uploads. Most definitely <em>not</em> for people afraid of using a computer.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I released <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart 1.5</a> for direct download customers and removed the previous version of Clipstart from the Mac App Store.

<li>
<p>Added &#8220;Consolidate&#8221; command for finding videos that have not been imported or duplicates outside the library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added AppleScript support for uploading videos. See the help menu for scripting examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved performance throughout the app, especially with importing and refreshing video thumbnails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved error message when failing to import all videos from a camera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed tags field on Add Folder dialog not resetting tags value after an import.</p>

TextExpander is the first popular app I&#8217;ve seen to do it.</p>
<p>Moom is another one that actively encourages users to move away from the store. Recently on launch Moom displayed a news window that included this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Apple has <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1167055/sandboxing_deadline_arrives_what_it_means_for_apple_developers_and_you.html">activated sandboxing</a> on the Mac App Store; under the sandboxing rules, we can no longer add new features to the App Store version of Moom (we can only fix bugs). However, we have a method by which you can migrate (<strong>at no cost</strong>) to our direct sales version of Moom, which <strong>has no such limitations</strong>. For details on how sandboxing affects our apps, and how to migrate to the direct sales version, please <a href="http://manytricks.com/sandbox">read this article</a> on our blog.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even Panic – frustrated with the long approval times for Coda 2.0.1 – is experimenting with how best to let Mac App Store customers migrate to the direct version. <a href="http://twitter.com/panic/statuses/215505347371220992">See this tweet and screenshot</a> from Cabel Sasser.</p>
<p>This has been a theme on the last couple episodes of <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>. Daniel Jalkut and I talked about how we feel about sandboxing after WWDC, and more on my decision to migrate Clipstart out of the store. Things are getting better in Mountain Lion, and I&#8217;ll revisit my decision next year, but for now I think I made the right call to focus on work outside the Mac App Store.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just approved in the Mac App Store, Clipstart 1.4.2 fixes upload issues with YouTube and especially Vimeo, which was broken in previous releases because of Vimeo API changes. I expect this to be the final Mac App Store release for Clipstart. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html">As I blogged about before</a>, all Mac App Store customers can upgrade to the direct download version for free.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you should do if you bought Clipstart from the Mac App Store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update to Clipstart 1.4.2 using the App Store app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run Clipstart at least once, then quit it. This allows it to copy the Mac App Store receipt so that it&#8217;s accessible to other versions of the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the latest version from the <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">main Clipstart web site</a> and replace the existing copy in your Applications folder with the direct download.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you&#8217;re thinking about buying Clipstart for the first time, please get it directly from the web site and checkout via PayPal. There&#8217;s also a demo with support for 2 uploads and tagging 20 videos.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now turning my attention to version 1.5, which will improve a few things and add support for Gatekeeper on Mountain Lion.</p>

<p>As I said <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_followup.html">earlier this year</a>, there will only be a couple more releases of Clipstart in the Mac App Store. My current plan is to switch completely over to direct-only sales with version 1.5. The new versions run without prompting for registration if you&#8217;ve already purchased and run a copy from the Mac App Store.</p>
