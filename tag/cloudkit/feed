				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, <a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/697911652142968832">Federico Viticci tweeted</a> that he lost a draft blog post he was working on because of an iCloud problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Just lost 1.5k words I had prepared for tomorrow because I wanted to try iCloud sync instead of Dropbox this week.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The story has a happy ending because he was able to manually recover the document from the app&#8217;s database, but that is well beyond the complexity that most users could handle. iCloud is usually so opaque that we just can&#8217;t see what is going on behind the scenes with our data.</p>
<p>Everything I write on this blog (and notes for all my projects) goes into simple text files on Dropbox. I can edit from multiple apps on different platforms, the files are synced everywhere, and Dropbox tracks the revisions of each file so that I can restore a previous version at any time. I could take the text file I&#8217;m currently typing in, drag it to the Finder&#8217;s trash <em>and empty it</em>, and restore from the web in 30 seconds even without any kind of traditional backup solution.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why all my photos are on Dropbox too. Instead of being opaque like iCloud, with no easy way to troubleshoot or recover files when things go wrong, with Dropbox it&#8217;s all there in the local file system or over the web.</p>
<p>Dropbox has had a few side projects and distractions, but their foundation is obvious and accessible, so they can keep coming back to that. <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/12/dropbox-to-discontinue-mailbox-and-carousel">Here&#8217;s Stephen Hackett writing in December</a> about documents and photos after Dropbox shut down Mailbox and Carousel:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;As much as these apps were loved by their users, it&#8217;s clear that the company is moving in another direction. While things like Paper don&#8217;t make much of a difference to me, knowing that Dropbox will reliably sync my files, be easy to use on iOS and continue to be around is important to me. If Mailbox and Carousel had to go to make that possible, then so be it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I really like the clean UI in Dropbox’s Paper, but because it doesn’t yet sync with regular files like the rest of Dropbox, Paper isn’t building on Dropbox’s core strengths. Daniel and I use it for planning <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, but I wouldn’t use it for critical writing any more than I would use the new Apple Notes.</p>
<p>I hear that people love iCloud Photo Library and Notes, and that the quality of these apps and companion services has significantly improved. That&#8217;s great. (I also think that CloudKit is clearly the best thing Apple has built for syncing yet.)</p>
<p>But to me, it doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s reliable or fast, or even if it “always” works. It only matters if I trust it when something goes wrong. Conceptually I’m not sure iCloud will ever get there for me.</p>
