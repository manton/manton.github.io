				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As most Nintendo Wii owners know by now, Mario Kart for Wii shipped last week. I put together yet another friend code database to track and share codes, but this one is unique because it builds on Twitter. Just follow &#8220;@wii&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii and send your friend code in a reply. No registration, no data entry. All your friends on Twitter who also use the system will automatically be linked, so you can quickly get a view of which friend codes to add. It&#8217;s also a great way to discover new Twitter users.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty happy with how the implementation has worked out. It&#8217;s build on essentially three background scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parsing replies every minute looking for the friend code pattern (1234-1234-1234 for game codes, with dashes or spaces).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking queued users and pulling everyone they are following into the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generating and caching the RSS feed for recently tweeted friend codes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The system currently only pulls the first 300 followers, but it&#8217;s running smoothly enough that I will bump that up to 500 this week. Over 150 people are currently using it, and the database has about 10,000 records to keep track of friends. I feel like it&#8217;s architected well enough to grow significantly from here, so I may do some casual promotion of the service this week.</p>
<p>If you own a Wii and use Twitter, &#8220;give it a try&#8221;:http://wiitransfer.com/codes/. If you have any questions or feature requests, please send me an email or reply on Twitter. Enjoy!</p>
