				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I was writing <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/08/2959.html">some documentation</a> this week, I kept thinking about what makes great marketing copy. 37signals used to say that <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Copywriting_is_Interface_Design.php">copywriting is a form of user interface design</a>. That&#8217;s true but I think there&#8217;s more to it.</p>
<p>The best products don&#8217;t just have marketing copy; they have a mission statement. They don&#8217;t just sell a tool; they sell a movement.</p>
<p>When I stare at my product wondering if it&#8217;s too confusing — if it&#8217;s too different, and tries to do too many things, to be immediately understood by new users — I try to remind myself that it&#8217;s an opportunity. Instead of simply explaining what I&#8217;m doing, how can I pitch it in a way that strengthens a community around the idea. Because dozens of bloggers can spread the idea more quickly and in a more meaningful way than I can by myself.</p>
<p>And unlike a one-way press release, a community is inherently two-way. Every mention of the idea is both marketing <em>and</em> feedback. Someone blogs about how they&#8217;re excited for the product, but also how they wish it had a certain missing feature. Someone in the press writes a review, but also with a pros and cons list.</p>
<p>This cycle means the product gets better. And if we&#8217;re thoughtful in that first approach to marketing copy, then every blog post, review, and tweet that follows is laced with a little part of our mission statement.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The MDN Show episode 16&#8221;:http://www.mac-developer-network.com/shows/podcasts/mdnshow/mdn016/ reveals the winner of the MDN Community Award: a tie between Matt Gemmell and Jonathan &#8220;Wolf&#8221; Rentzsch, with Mike Ash as runner-up. Looking back on 2009 there should be no surprise over these top three. Matt has been sharing great code with the community for years and is now a fixture of the MDN podcast; Wolf started the successful C4 conference and won a Macworld Eddy for ClickToFlash; and Mike Ash has packed more technical information into a year of his weekly Q&amp;A series than would fit in many Mac programming books.</p>
<p>(This also seems like a good time to link to nominee Daniel Jalkut, who got &#8220;his own version of a community award&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/1074/payback-time last month.)</p>
<p>I had a tough time singling out a specific developer among a dozen or more fantastic people, many who I consider my friends. But for me it was an opportunity to reflect on something at C4 that I didn&#8217;t get a chance to write about earlier, and since he won anyway I&#8217;ll include the email I sent to Scotty here.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are so many worthy candidates for the &#8220;MDN Community Award&#8221;:http://www.mac-developer-network.com/news/mdn-community-award-2009-update-the-nominations-so-far/ &mdash; people who are helpful to the Mac developer community by writing books, blogging, and sharing code &mdash; but when I heard about this award I thought about leadership. My pick is Jonathan &#8216;Wolf&#8217; Rentzsch.</p>
<p>&#8220;A leader sets the tone and attitude of the community. For example, at the C4 conference when some attendees used the Twitter backchannel to turn against and openly mock a presenter, Wolf shamed the audience instead of glossing over or ignoring the event. It was a community course-correction and a reminder that Mac OS X developers come from many different backgrounds: old-school classic Mac programmers, NeXT developers, Linux and Windows users, even designers and web application developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The community went through a rough transition point migrating to Mac OS X over 10 years ago, and is in the middle of another transition to embrace everyone excited about the iPhone platform. What I learned from Wolf is that we should never be afraid to welcome &#8216;outsiders&#8217; to the community even if they haven&#8217;t yet caught up on the history and conventions of the platform.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I have nothing but great things to say about everyone listed on the MDN page. Congrats again to Matt, Wolf, Mike, and the rest of the nominees.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brent Simmons, from a &#8220;TUAW interview&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/05/5-questions-with-brent-simmons-creator-of-netnewswire/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One of the things I love about being a Mac developer is getting to meet the folks who make the apps I use. In a way, my /Applications folder is also my social network. Which is cool.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I never thought about it that way, but it&#8217;s definitely a great aspect of the Mac developer community. I hope to add a few more people to my /Applications social network next week at WWDC.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to a bunch of WWDCs now, but I&#8217;m particularly excited this year because it will be the first time I&#8217;ve attended as representing both a &#8220;large-ish company&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ and an &#8220;independent one-man shop&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/.</p>
<p>I will be carrying VitalSource business cards in my wallet, but I also hope to have a printed batch of Wii Transfer serial numbers to hand out. I know a lot of Mac developers have a Nintendo Wii and it&#8217;s a shame I haven&#8217;t given out more copies. If you have a Wii and see me (I look &#8220;something like this&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/me/), please get my attention so that I can correct this oversight.</p>
