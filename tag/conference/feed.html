				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m registered for the <a href="https://releasenotes.tv/conference/">Release Notes conference</a>, coming up later this year in Indianapolis. This will be the only conference I attend this year outside of another ticketless WWDC week. If you didn&#8217;t go last year and want to know more about it, check out the web site or <a href="https://releasenotes.tv/151-our-2-0-1/">listen to episode 151 of their podcast</a>.</p>
<p>One of my favorite blog posts on this site from last year was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/10/release-notes-2015.html">my review of the conference</a>, because I think it both described the conference itself and also captured that inspired feeling you get when you&#8217;re heading off to the airport and your head is buzzing with ideas. And because it&#8217;s a blog, where I allow myself to be informal, it also has the meandering narrative of the everyday â€” a stop for coffee, a conversation with an Uber driver. My memory of the conference wouldn&#8217;t be complete without those things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to visiting Indianapolis again. I may also look at flying into Chicago and taking the train down, then flying out. Sounds like some people did that last year, and I think it would make a great start considering the venue at Union Station. We&#8217;ll see if the schedule works out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2006/airport_man.jpg" width="143" height="296" alt="Airport sketch" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" /> I attended &#8220;RailsConf&#8221;:http://www.railsconf.org/ in Chicago last month. There&#8217;s a lot of excitement in the Rails community right now, and it was nice to be there for the first year before it explodes to the even bigger event that the conference will be next year when O&#8217;Reilly takes over.</p>
<p>The talks were a mix of great to just okay. &#8220;Damon Clinkscales&#8221;:http://www.damonclinkscales.com/ provided a solid introduction to migrations, and even though he had previewed the talk for me the night before I still picked up some useful tips. I was finally able to hear first hand what a fantastic speaker &#8220;Mike Clark&#8221;:http://www.clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom is. James Duncan Davidson rounded out the weekend with a high-level &#8220;vision for deployments&#8221;:http://duncandavidson.com/essay/2006/06/webaspipe/. I also enjoyed presentations by &#8220;Paul Graham&#8221;:http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html, the music and brilliance of &#8220;Why&#8221;:http://redhanded.hobix.com/, the closing Rails core team panel, and of course &#8220;DHH on REST and embracing CRUD&#8221;:http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000593.html. One of the nice things about open source is that soon after announcing the new ActiveResource framework, David checked in his code so you can immediately see &#8220;what he has been working on&#8221;:http://dev.rubyonrails.org/svn/rails/trunk/activeresource/ and play along.</p>
<p>As I look back on the schedule, there were many talks I missed completely, so I&#8217;m looking forward to catching the audio or video of some of those. Still, you could get a lot out of the conference just by talking to people between or during sessions.</p>
<p>While at the Austin airport, I filled a sketchbook page with random people waiting for the delayed flight. This man on the right was leaning against an abandoned ticket counter.</p>
