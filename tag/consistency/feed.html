				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I went to <a href="http://opencoffeeaustin.org/">Open Coffee Club</a> during SXSW week, I met several company founders and investors in Austin, and one was also an iOS developer. I usually do a poor job of promoting my own work in person, but I somehow managed to plug my <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition podcast</a>.</p>
<p>He hadn’t heard of the show before, and when he pulled it up to subscribe his comment was something like: “wow, you’ve been doing this for a long time”. It’s true. Daniel and I started the podcast in 2008. We only have 225 episodes, because we published episodes less frequently back in the old days, but I’ve always been proud of our consistency with the show format going back to the very beginning.</p>
<p>And it made me wonder: is there another Mac or iOS developer-focused tech podcast that has such a long history? Or really, many tech podcasts at all? The ones that come to mind are <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>, which started in 2007, and <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech">This Week in Tech</a>, which started in 2005.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another reminder to me that a big part of success is consistently showing up to work. If you&#8217;re always starting over, you can&#8217;t build on anything and take it further. The secret with the &#8220;version 2.0&#8221; of most apps isn&#8217;t that it has new features; it&#8217;s just that it exists at all.</p>
<p>In a couple months, just as WWDC is about to roll around, we’ll celebrate our 8th anniversary of recording Core Intuition. Our audience keeps growing, which is amazing, but there are still a lot of people who have never heard of the show. If you like what we&#8217;ve been doing, consider telling a friend, or posting a tweet or blog post about the show.</p>
<p>We expanded to 2 sponsors per episode this year because we wanted to grow the podcast — to commit more time and resources to both recording and to companion web sites like <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">the jobs site</a>. I think 2016 will be a great year and I&#8217;m happy that Core Intuition is a key part of helping me stay independent. Thanks for your support!</p>
