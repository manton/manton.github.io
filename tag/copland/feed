				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;John Siracusa rants a bit&#8221;:http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits.ars/2006/7/21/4727 about the lack of access to WWDC for non-attendees. I agree that the session DVDs, sample code, and other resources should be made available to everyone. But there is so much to the conference that can&#8217;t be bottled up for later.</p>
<p>I have been extremely lucky to have been able to attend WWDC for each of the last 5 years with &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/, and a few years off and on before that. I think my first WWDC was 1996, which also makes next week my 10th anniversary of attending.</p>
<p>1996 was &#8220;Copland&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copland, the middle of the dark years for Apple. It was strange to be a Mac developer back then, to stay optimistic in the face of a barrage of bad press. I think it helped that I was &#8220;part of a small team&#8221;:http://www.purity.com/ that was passionate about this stuff. We couldn&#8217;t imagine building Windows software, although we did dabble in BeOS pretty extensively.</p>
<p>So, on to my hopes for this year. First, I have no idea what will be in Leopard. Like many people, I hope for some Finder improvements and an effort to bring the fragmented window and control types back together. I also assume that Leopard will have nice new features, and that those features will have developer APIs to go along with them.</p>
<p>Second, for the last couple of years I&#8217;ve believed that a Mac tablet is forthcoming. Tiger introduced two core pieces to this: handwriting recognition and portrait mode. &#8220;Patent rumors&#8221;:http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/archive/buzz_apples_new_accelerometer_patent_reveals_a_stunning_tablet_pc/ continue to hint at such a device. Judging by how many designers and animators have embraced the Windows-based Tablet PCs (for which the hardware mostly still sucks), I think an Apple-designed tablet could be extremely popular. This is the only piece of hardware I would literally buy on day 1.</p>
<p>Going to WWDC? Say &#8220;hi&#8221; if you see someone who &#8220;looks like this&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/me/293.jpg.</p>
