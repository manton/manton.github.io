				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s no denying the fact that my writing would have a greater reach today if I was still active on Twitter and tweeting links there. Posting to <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">my own microblog feed</a> and cross-posting to the dwindling user base that is App.net has an obvious “if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?” aspect to it. If the post is read by so few people, some might argue that it can’t be as relevant to a larger conversation.</p>
<p>This doesn’t bum me out, though. It <em>inspires</em> me. It reminds me that I believe in something ambitious that has to be built in layers, starting small — a more open microblog platform that other apps can hang on to, encouraging new writing that will last.</p>
<p>Dave Winer calls this process of building successful platforms <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2007/04/28/twitterAsCoralReef.html">a coral reef</a>. I think it’s a forest. Only the most passionate users of the open web can hear the tree falling today, but tomorrow there will be new growth. We plant a seed with each tool we build and with every RSS feed that’s wired up. There will eventually be many forests, crowded with plenty of people listening, interconnected regions that can’t be bound in the way a closed system inherently is.</p>
<p>If you <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/04/how-to-start-a-microblog.html">join in and post</a>, maybe your posts won’t be heard as clearly today. But in the future they will become the oldest, strongest pillars around which everything else grows.</p>
