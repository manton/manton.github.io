				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/podcasting-microphones">Marco&#8217;s review of his favorite microphones</a> is comprehensive. You can&#8217;t go wrong by following his advice. I recorded my first podcast <a href="http://www.manton.org/2005/08/trains_podcast.html">10 years ago</a>, and Daniel and I are about to hit 200 episodes of <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, yet I still learned a few new things from reading Marco&#8217;s review.</p>
<p>As with most things, though, it&#8217;s a personal choice too. Take this part:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;If you’re just getting started with podcasting, a USB mic is good enough. If you’re established and looking to upgrade your production quality, or if you just love gear like me, you’ll likely find the jump to XLR worthwhile.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I did the opposite of this. For years I used an XLR mic along with a chain of two additional audio devices: the M-Audio FireWire Solo for getting the audio into the Mac, and the PreSonus TubePRE preamp for boosting the signal. This produced a nice sound and gave me knobs to fiddle with, but the extra complexity was just not worth it. I now use a simple USB mic and prefer it. (It&#8217;s the Rode Podcaster, which gets a mediocre endorsement in Marco&#8217;s review.)</p>
<p>This kind of &#8220;downgrading&#8221; is a common pattern with me and computers. I used to run a Mac Pro with 2 external Cinema Displays. Now I exclusively use a 13-inch retina MacBook Pro without a monitor.</p>
<p>In both cases — Macs and microphones — I find the trade-off worth it. If I want to work from a coffee shop, it&#8217;s the same resolution display, so I don&#8217;t need to change how I use Xcode. If I travel and need to record a podcast, it&#8217;s the same as if I was home, so I don&#8217;t need to risk messing up my audio settings. You give up some performance and flexibility, but in exchange you get the simplicity of having the same setup no matter where you are. And best of all: no more cables all over my desk.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My good friend and Core Intuition co-host <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel Jalkut</a> isn&#8217;t convinced. After we recorded last week&#8217;s podcast, we talked privately about the direction I&#8217;m headed in. He&#8217;s seen the projects I have in development, but he thinks working on Mac apps is a safer bet than web services. And he works on a blogging app, so if I can&#8217;t convince him that the goals I have around microblogging-related tools can be a real business, how am I going to convince the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Earlier this year I gave a talk at CocoaConf about tips I&#8217;ve learned to be productive while juggling multiple projects. But as I worked on the talk, it turned out to be about something else. It was about Walt Disney moving from Kansas City to Hollywood. It was about crazy side projects that no one else believed in. It was about Texas Hold &#8216;Em poker and risking everything for an idea.</p>
<p>The new microblogging app and service I&#8217;ve been working on, off and on for the last year, is the most ambitious project I&#8217;ve ever attempted. It is difficult to explain and market, it might only resonate with a niche audience, and it is going to increase my hosting costs. So part of me knows that Daniel is right — that the smart business decision is to put it on hold and focus on my Mac apps, which will probably have more predictable revenue.</p>
<p>And yet, this project is also the most meaningful. In the words of Peter Thiel, it could take independent microblogging from <a href="http://zerotoonebook.com/">zero to one</a>. A new push forward for weblogs, maybe the first in a while. Therefore, I must do it, and I must accept some risk in the process.</p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been working on the iPhone version. When you look at these screenshots, it might be tempting to compare it to Twitter. Don&#8217;t. Instead, think about how the plumbing fits together: RSS, microblogs, and the open web.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/snippets_iphone_screenshots.png" width="607" height="344" alt="screenshot" border="0" /></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to officially announce and ship this. If you&#8217;d like to get an email when the beta is ready, <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the announcement list</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.caseyliss.com/2015/8/17/a-year-of-relay-fm">Casey Liss summarizes</a> the excellent first year of new podcast network Relay FM:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Last year, I was deeply honored to be invited to be part of the launch shows on Relay. This year, I’m deeply honored to be a part of a network that not only airs some of the best spoken word programming on the internet, but also cares so deeply about being more inclusive.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to all the podcast hosts, and of course to Relay founders Myke Hurley and Stephen Hackett. <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/8/how-im-spending-my-indie-time">Stephen posted</a> about how his time as an indie is going:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The hours break down about how I felt they would break down, with Relay FM taking up about half my time and everything else going down from there. I suspect that consulting number will shrink as I wrap up some stuff for my former employer, but for now, I think this balance works. It&#8217;s a decent reflection of where my income is, which is encouraging.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Rewinding a few weeks, <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/8/whole-ass-one-thing">this is what he had to say</a> about the shift to indie work:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;It’s profoundly surreal, but incredibly freeing, to be focused on my writing and podcasting full-time. There’s still lots to work out with budgets and time management and extra things I could take on, but it’s all under the category of <em>my</em> work. That’s what makes it so much fun, despite the unknowns.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to watch the rise of podcast networks. It has now been a little over 5 years since I <a href="http://www.manton.org/2010/02/5_by_5.html">first wrote about the 5by5 launch</a>. Daniel and I will probably keep <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> independent forever, but I hope that the continued success of larger networks means that the overall podcast market is still growing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing from last week’s Core Intuition, today Daniel and I talk more about how things are going with the final days of my job winding down. We then take the second half of the show to catch up on recent news around Twitter’s leadership.</p>
<p>From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Daniel and Manton acknowledge celebration as a survival tactic, discuss the urgency of making ends meet as an indie, and examine changes underway at Twitter with interim CEO Jack Dorsey.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>You can listen or subscribe at the <a href="http://coreint.org/192">Core Intuition web site</a>. Special thanks to returning sponsor <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/">CocoaConf</a>. They’ve got conferences coming up in Boston and San Jose, and then Yosemite National Park next year.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We just published <a href="http://coreint.org/191">Core Intuition 191</a>, the first episode recorded since I resigned from my regular job. In a way, it feels like this episode was 7 years in the making. Although I clearly wasn’t about to go indie that long ago, the topics that we’ve chosen to discuss on the podcast over the years have always followed that basic narrative: what can we do to improve our apps and business.</p>
<p>And as I hinted about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/two-weeks-notice-podcast-revenue.html">earlier this week</a>, this episode also features the return of our sponsor Twitter to promote their Fabric suite of tools for developers, including Crashlytics and Answers. Great to have them back.</p>
<p>From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Manton and Daniel discuss Manton&#8217;s big decision to quit his job and go full-time indie. They also discuss the challenges of freeing up one&#8217;s mind to focus on work, the freedom of indie development, and the psychological benefits of a dedicated workplace.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a milestone episode for me. I hope you enjoy it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/two-weeks-notice-the-first-weekend.html">In my first post</a> I framed the situation as pinning my indie hopes on two things: my own apps and client work. But <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2015/07/20/full-time-indie/">as Daniel points out</a>, I’ve actually lucked into several distinct revenue sources. And one of the most promising continues to be our <a href="http://www.coreint.org/sponsorship/">Core Intuition podcast sponsorships</a> and the companion <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">jobs site</a>.</p>
<p>The podcast got some good news over the weekend as we’re adding another long-term sponsor. We’ve had this company as sponsors in the past, and I’m looking forward to having them back and talking about how I use their products.</p>
<p>Like software, revenue from Core Intuition comes in waves. Sometimes we’ll be booked up for months, other times there will be a drought of sponsors, so we’ll focus on pitching the jobs site instead. Sometimes we’ll get new job listings every day, other times a week will go by with nothing. Since we’re not actively marketing it as if it was a full-time business, we can’t count on any kind of consistency from it.</p>
<p>It’s funny how the podcast worked out, though. We started it just because we thought it would be neat — because we thought we had something to share with the community, back in 2008 when there were very few developer podcasts. We added sponsorships to help justify the time and keep us to a weekly schedule. And now, ironically, the podcast that was <em>about</em> running an indie business will actually help me do just that.</p>
<p>I’m so grateful to listeners new and old who have supported us. I received a bunch of nice “congrats!” emails and mentions on <a href="http://chat.coreint.org/">our Slack channels</a> yesterday. We’re approaching 200 episodes now, over 7 years, and I hope we can continue to keep the podcast interesting for some time to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve been lucky to see some great job listings appear on <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">Core Intuition Jobs</a>. Companies are getting good résumés and job applicants are finding the kind of job they’ve always wanted.</p>
<p>When we hear from companies who have hired someone, we like to include a brief testimonial on the sidebar of the site. We’re about to add this one from Ken Drew at iRobot:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Our experience with the Core Intuition Jobs board went beyond our expectations. It provided higher caliber candidates for our recent iOS developer position. After doing code reviews for the candidate we eventually hired, we are more than pleased with who we found.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you to everyone who <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">listens to the podcast</a> or watches <a href="http://twitter.com/coreintjobs">on Twitter</a> for new job listings. The opportunities for iOS and Mac developers have never been better. Get the job you want or find the next great member of your team.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We were lagging a little after the Thanksgiving break, so we posted two episodes of Core Intuition last week. On <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2014/12/episode-166-i-should-be-making-a-mac-app/">the latest episode</a> we talk about the <a href="http://code.org/">Hour of Code</a> and welcome new listeners who found our podcast from the App Store feature.</p>
<p>After we recorded, I helped out my son&#8217;s elementary school class with the Hour of Code tutorials. I learned a lot and came away even more impressed with the project. The reach is pretty incredible. Even if it only sways the interest of a couple kids here and there, but spread over classrooms all across the world, you can imagine how big a difference it might make.</p>
