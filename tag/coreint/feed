				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://coreint.org/211">Today on Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I talk about my time at the tvOS Tech Talk and the recent executive changes at Apple. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Manton and Daniel discuss Apple TV development challenges, Apple’s executive team shakeup and its impact on the App Stores, and keeping a good attitude about successes and shortcomings as an ambitious indie developer.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>We wrap up the show with a conversation about taking risks and setting the right priorities for an indie business. Along the way I mention <a href="http://twitter.com/boltcity/status/6672228351">this tweet from Kazu Kibuishi</a>, which I misquoted slightly. Here&#8217;s the actual text:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;A professor once told me that &#8216;if you have a fallback, you will fall back.&#8217; I have found this to be true.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you enjoy the show, consider letting a friend know about it, or leaving a mini review on Twitter or iTunes. Thanks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/12/episode-210-they-pushed-it-to-github/">latest Core Intuition</a>, we talk about open source Swift, it&#8217;s potential for web server frameworks, and more about blogging tools. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Daniel and Manton react to Swift’s open-sourcing, and the extent to which it adds momentum to the language and increases its appeal. They also discuss the open-sourcing of Microsoft’s MarsEdit-esque blog editor, Windows Live Writer.&#8221;

<p>There were also a few new jobs posted to <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">jobs.coreint.org</a> yesterday. Check them out if you&#8217;re considering a change for 2016, or just curious what is out there for Objective-C and Swift jobs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many developers, I&#8217;ve spent the morning looking over the <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift open source release</a>. I continue to be intrigued and look forward to working Swift into more of my routine.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/12/episode-209-we-need-a-grand-gesture/">today&#8217;s Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I talked about Swift for about half of the 50-minute episode. We recorded the episode yesterday afternoon, before the open source announcement, so we&#8217;ll be following up next week on everything that has changed. I bet there will be some more progress in Swift web server frameworks by then, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard <a href="http://blog.sketchapp.com/post/134322691555/leaving-the-mac-app-store">the news about Sketch</a>. I found this section of their announcement the most interesting, because it highlights that this isn&#8217;t just about technical and strategic problems with the Mac App Store, but also about having a direct relationship with the customer to provide the best experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Over the last year, as we’ve made great progress with Sketch, the customer experience on the Mac App Store hasn’t evolved like its iOS counterpart. We want to continue to be a responsive, approachable, and easily-reached company, and selling Sketch directly allows us to give <em>you</em> a better experience.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Sketch joins <a href="https://dancounsell.com/articles/not-on-the-mac-app-store">a growing list</a> of apps unavailable in the store. From <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/12/01/sketch-leaves-mac-app-store">John Gruber</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Sketch isn’t the first big name professional app to be pulled from the Mac App Store (Bare Bones Software’s <a href="http://www.barebones.com/store/macappstore.html">BBEdit</a>, Panic’s <a href="https://panic.com/blog/coda-2-5-and-the-mac-app-store/">Coda</a>, <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2015/11/24/quicken-2015-switches-from-mac-app-store-to-direct-updates/">Quicken</a>, just to name a few). But Sketch is the poster child for Mac App Store era professional Mac software. It’s the sort of app Apple might demo in a keynote — and the winner of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/the-2012-apple-design-award-winners/">an Apple Design Award</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/sketch-is-leaving-the-mac-app-store/">Federico Viticci writes</a> that Apple has to do something:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The simple reality is that, gradually, developers of the best apps for OS X are finding it increasingly hard to justify doing business on the Mac App Store. I hope Apple also sees this as a problem and starts doing <em>something</em> about it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Daniel and I talked about this <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/11/episode-207-pretty-please-apple/">on Core Intuition recently</a>. Developers have been complaining about the Mac App Store for years without seeing any progress. It was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html">over 3 years ago</a> that I pulled my app Clipstart from the Mac App Store to sell direct-only instead, because of my concerns about adapting to sandboxing.</p>
<p>All this time, Apple could have been iterating on the Mac App Store, improving sandboxing entitlements, improving review times, customer interaction, and more. Yet they have not. At this point, Apple can&#8217;t just do &#8220;something&#8221;. They can&#8217;t just improve the Mac App Store a little. They have to <em>significantly</em> improve it, addressing many issues at once. And even then, some of these great apps — Sketch, BBEdit, Coda, RapidWeaver — may not come back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we published <a href="http://coreint.org/206">episode 206 of Core Intuition</a>. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Daniel returns from Amsterdam to find Mac App Store issues abound. Manton buys an iPad Pro but has to wait for the Pencil. The two discuss the Mac App Store’s 6-year failure to evolve substantially, and dig into the emotional highs and lows of enjoying and surviving Apple’s platform constraints.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I really love how this episode turned out. It hits on several themes that have run through our show since the very first episode: a little tech news, some high-level coding talk, a bit of business analysis, and wrapped up with just how we <em>feel</em> right now about being indie developers. I hope you enjoy it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We posted <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/10/episode-202-juggling-more-than-ever/">episode 202 of Core Intuition</a> yesterday. This was a fun episode because we didn&#8217;t plan for it; we just started talking. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Manton and Daniel discuss the paralysis of choosing what to work on as an indie, Manton’s mysterious Kickstarter campaign, and the allure of company stickers and other marketing stuff.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Make sure to listen through the end for why I ordered <a href="https://twitter.com/riverfold/status/651509114284044288">stickers for my new app</a>. If you want one, you can <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">email me</a> or send us <a href="mailto:feedback@coreint.org">podcast feedback</a>.</p>
<p>As I said on the show, I highly recommend checking out <a href="http://www.relay.fm/tc">Thoroughly Considered</a>, the companion podcast for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/obi-a-smart-laser-toy-for-pets">Studio Neat&#8217;s Kickstarter project</a>. While you&#8217;re there, also consider backing the project, at the podcast level or the full Obi product if you have a pet that would love it. Even if it doesn&#8217;t successfully fund, I really enjoyed the first couple episodes of their podcast and hope it continues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/podcasting-microphones">Marco&#8217;s review of his favorite microphones</a> is comprehensive. You can&#8217;t go wrong by following his advice. I recorded my first podcast <a href="http://www.manton.org/2005/08/trains_podcast.html">10 years ago</a>, and Daniel and I are about to hit 200 episodes of <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, yet I still learned a few new things from reading Marco&#8217;s review.</p>
<p>As with most things, though, it&#8217;s a personal choice too. Take this part:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;If you’re just getting started with podcasting, a USB mic is good enough. If you’re established and looking to upgrade your production quality, or if you just love gear like me, you’ll likely find the jump to XLR worthwhile.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I did the opposite of this. For years I used an XLR mic along with a chain of two additional audio devices: the M-Audio FireWire Solo for getting the audio into the Mac, and the PreSonus TubePRE preamp for boosting the signal. This produced a nice sound and gave me knobs to fiddle with, but the extra complexity was just not worth it. I now use a simple USB mic and prefer it. (It&#8217;s the Rode Podcaster, which gets a mediocre endorsement in Marco&#8217;s review.)</p>
<p>This kind of &#8220;downgrading&#8221; is a common pattern with me and computers. I used to run a Mac Pro with 2 external Cinema Displays. Now I exclusively use a 13-inch retina MacBook Pro without a monitor.</p>
<p>In both cases — Macs and microphones — I find the trade-off worth it. If I want to work from a coffee shop, it&#8217;s the same resolution display, so I don&#8217;t need to change how I use Xcode. If I travel and need to record a podcast, it&#8217;s the same as if I was home, so I don&#8217;t need to risk messing up my audio settings. You give up some performance and flexibility, but in exchange you get the simplicity of having the same setup no matter where you are. And best of all: no more cables all over my desk.</p>
