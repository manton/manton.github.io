				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I went to <a href="http://opencoffeeaustin.org/">Open Coffee Club</a> during SXSW week, I met several company founders and investors in Austin, and one was also an iOS developer. I usually do a poor job of promoting my own work in person, but I somehow managed to plug my <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition podcast</a>.</p>
<p>He hadn’t heard of the show before, and when he pulled it up to subscribe his comment was something like: “wow, you’ve been doing this for a long time”. It’s true. Daniel and I started the podcast in 2008. We only have 225 episodes, because we published episodes less frequently back in the old days, but I’ve always been proud of our consistency with the show format going back to the very beginning.</p>
<p>And it made me wonder: is there another Mac or iOS developer-focused tech podcast that has such a long history? Or really, many tech podcasts at all? The ones that come to mind are <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>, which started in 2007, and <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech">This Week in Tech</a>, which started in 2005.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another reminder to me that a big part of success is consistently showing up to work. If you&#8217;re always starting over, you can&#8217;t build on anything and take it further. The secret with the &#8220;version 2.0&#8221; of most apps isn&#8217;t that it has new features; it&#8217;s just that it exists at all.</p>
<p>In a couple months, just as WWDC is about to roll around, we’ll celebrate our 8th anniversary of recording Core Intuition. Our audience keeps growing, which is amazing, but there are still a lot of people who have never heard of the show. If you like what we&#8217;ve been doing, consider telling a friend, or posting a tweet or blog post about the show.</p>
<p>We expanded to 2 sponsors per episode this year because we wanted to grow the podcast — to commit more time and resources to both recording and to companion web sites like <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">the jobs site</a>. I think 2016 will be a great year and I&#8217;m happy that Core Intuition is a key part of helping me stay independent. Thanks for your support!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/03/episode-225-keep-your-eyes-open/">Episode 225 of Core Intuition</a> is out now. We talk about the new iPhone and iPad news from Monday’s Apple event, plus Swift. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Manton orders his dream phone, the iPhone SE. Daniel reflects on the growing allure of Swift, and the two discuss the risks of either adopting new technologies too soon, or holding on to the past for too long.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Also there&#8217;s this line from Daniel in the podcast that I like:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We have to be tuned into the future <em>and</em> tuned into the past to really do great work.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We pull in some history from Daniel&#8217;s time at Apple, and from our experience building Mac apps in the 1990s and early 2000s, and how it relates to the current Swift transition. Hope you enjoy it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We posted <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/03/episode-224-its-good-enough-for-cookie-monster/">episode 224 of Core Intuition today</a>. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Manton and Daniel discuss Apple’s revelation that Cookie Monster uses an iPhone, consider the Amazon Echo as the next big technology platform, and catch up with Manton’s successful 30 days of Austin coffee challenge.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I like this episode because it touches a little on tech industry and business themes that we weren&#8217;t planning to talk about, so it captures whatever our gut feelings were on those topics. And as we talk about at the end of the show, I did end up wrapping up the coffee shop visits today. I&#8217;ve updated <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">the coffee shop page on this site</a> with the final list.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I tell people that <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">I&#8217;ve started going to a new coffee shop every day</a> for a month — and importantly, one which I&#8217;ve never been to before after living my whole life in Austin, with no duplicates or separate locations from a coffee chain — they usually ask: are you going to run out of places to go? At the beginning I didn&#8217;t know. And that has made it a particularly fun challenge, because <em>doing something that you know is possible is boring</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been interested in building an iOS app that someone else has already done. I&#8217;ve never been excited to write a blog post that is just a rephrasing of someone else&#8217;s idea. Starting a new project with a unique twist, even a minor one, is what makes our job as developers and writers fun.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s easy to take a simple idea and build it into a more advanced project. <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/02/episode-221-in-the-zone-of-programming/">On the latest Core Intuition</a>, Daniel continues to suggest ways to add layers to my coffee trips, from adding photos, to publishing future locations ahead of time so that anyone can stop by and join me for a coffee. (I&#8217;m going to be doing this.)</p>
<p>Now at day 10, I can more easily answer the original question, though. I have 16 suggested coffee shops in the queue, so if I visit all of those, I&#8217;ll only need 4 more places to hit 30 new coffee shops in 30 days. A few of these might seem like borderline cheats — a donut shop, or a food truck to pick up a Thai iced coffee — but being exposed to new places I would never otherwise go is the whole point.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On <a href="http://coreint.org/218">this week’s Core Intuition</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Manton and Daniel talk about Apple’s current and future stock price, and their potential to branch out into other technologies such as virtual reality. They discuss Facebook’s shuttering of Parse and the implications for iOS developers and Facebook’s PR. Finally, they respond to listener Q&amp;A about getting up to speed on using and implementing your own web services.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Toward the end of the show, I also discuss my approach to password-less accounts for <a href="http://searchpath.io/">Searchpath</a> and my not-quite-released latest web app. While still far from perfect, I think getting away from passwords is an important next step for apps. Passwords are just too annoying for users to keep track of and enter, and a potential security issue and headache for system administrators.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m launching a new podcast today. For a while I&#8217;ve felt like there could be something interesting in a very short podcast, where I talk a little about what I&#8217;m working on or thinking about throughout the week. Each episode is going to be just 3-5 minutes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/">Timetable</a>. I&#8217;ve published 3 episodes, and have a 4th that will go out later today. I think of it as a &#8220;microcast&#8221;, complementing the informal nature of my microblog posts. And just as I have longer essays on my weblog, of course I&#8217;ll continue to explore larger topics for indie Mac and iOS developers on <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> with Daniel Jalkut.</p>
<p>If you check it out, let me know what you think at <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">manton@manton.org</a>. Thanks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://coreint.org/211">Today on Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I talk about my time at the tvOS Tech Talk and the recent executive changes at Apple. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Manton and Daniel discuss Apple TV development challenges, Apple’s executive team shakeup and its impact on the App Stores, and keeping a good attitude about successes and shortcomings as an ambitious indie developer.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>We wrap up the show with a conversation about taking risks and setting the right priorities for an indie business. Along the way I mention <a href="http://twitter.com/boltcity/status/6672228351">this tweet from Kazu Kibuishi</a>, which I misquoted slightly. Here&#8217;s the actual text:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;A professor once told me that &#8216;if you have a fallback, you will fall back.&#8217; I have found this to be true.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you enjoy the show, consider letting a friend know about it, or leaving a mini review on Twitter or iTunes. Thanks!</p>

<p>On <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/12/episode-209-we-need-a-grand-gesture/">today&#8217;s Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I talked about Swift for about half of the 50-minute episode. We recorded the episode yesterday afternoon, before the open source announcement, so we&#8217;ll be following up next week on everything that has changed. I bet there will be some more progress in Swift web server frameworks by then, too.</p>
