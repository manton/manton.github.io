				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My friend &#8220;John Rubio&#8221;:http://www.johnrubio.com/ has launched a new site: &#8220;CREATEaPro&#8221;:http://www.createapro.com/. A steady flow of good essays is already filling up the site. His latest, &#8220;10 Essential Tips to Becoming a Successful Creative Pro&#8221;:http://www.createapro.com/2006/07/10/10-essential-tips-to-becoming-a-more-successful-creative-pro/, is equally applicable to a wide range of disciplines, not just designers, illustrators, animators, or other artists the site is aimed at.</p>
<p>I like this paragraph from his introductory post:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If I could go back, I would have paid more attention. I would have started my education not then, but at 8, when I first discovered the blackroom they had stashed behind my uncle Richard&#8217;s light table. I would have spent more time studying the racks of lead type before dismissing them as just things that got my hands and homemade clothes covered in ink.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It underscores what seems to be the main theme of the site: get working and stay confident.</p>
<p>Sometimes I worry that I wasted too much time with trivial stuff, pushing away time for what is really important. But then I&#8217;ll encounter an artist or visionary who got a late start and still made the best of it. It&#8217;s never too late.</p>
<p>Unless you listen to &#8220;John Kricfalusi&#8221;:http://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/2006/05/animation-school-lessons-do-you-want.html: &#8220;After 24 if you haven&#8217;t already become really good, you will stagnate and your powers of learning and your rebellious youthful attitude will have died.&#8221;</p>
