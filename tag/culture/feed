				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This line in a <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/feature-film/space-jam-sequel-is-in-the-works-96410.html">blog post on Cartoon Brew</a> made me laugh:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It’s certainly possible to write a Looney Tunes script, just as it’s possible to eat a hamburger with your feet, but there are smarter, easier, and better ways to do it.”

<p>Every industry that gets big probably has some of this. There’s the old school, the folks who know the right way to do things — for example, you start an animated film with sketches and storyboards, not words — and then there’s everyone who comes in afterwards, without the history and culture of what made it all work. Look at what the App Store has become, compared to how software development worked in the 1990s or early 2000s. If it wasn’t for all the money some of these new developers are making they’d be completely embarrassing themselves with technical naivety and <a href="http://www.bluecloudsolutions.com/blog/money-apps-turn-1k-200k-portfolio/">depressing lack of vision</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, great ideas often start with newcomers. But please respect the past before you break from it.</p>
