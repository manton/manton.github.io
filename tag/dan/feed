				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I received a lot of feedback after &#8220;I first wrote about the Kindle&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/11/kindle.html, so here&#8217;s an update. I admit I&#8217;m still trying to understand the device; it has not immediately fallen into a spot in my routine the way the iPod and iPhone did.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan Benjamin&#8221;:http://www.hivelogic.com/ pointed out that it&#8217;s wrong to compare the Kindle and iPhone because they are two completely separate kinds of devices, and that&#8217;s true. But the fact remains that Amazon could have partnered with AT&amp;T and required a monthly fee for connectivity. Instead they chose to eat that cost to provide a seamless user experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Willie Abrams&#8221;:http://willie.tumblr.com/ bought a Kindle and then returned it, unhappy with both the contrast on the device and the slow page turns. As I pointed out in my original post, the page turns are annoying, but they won&#8217;t ruin the device for most people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andy Ihnatko&#8221;:http://ihnatko.com/ wrote glowingly about the Kindle and spoke at length on MacBreak Weekly about the free wireless and adequate web browser. Personally I have found the web browser to be extremely poor and the slow refresh inappropriate for modern, interactive sites. I didn&#8217;t even realize it came with a browser when I ordered it, though, so I consider it a nice bonus.</p>
<p>When I left town to take a week and a half holiday road trip with my family, I decided to leave the Kindle at home. After all, I already had my MacBook, iPhone, Nintendo DS, and a hardback book that would easily fill the week. The Kindle is small but it would just be wasted clutter in my backpack.</p>
<p>This turned out to be a mistake. For one, I had spotty Edge coverage in middle-of-nowhere West Texas, and it would have been an interesting experiment to see how the Kindle&#8217;s EVDO faired in other cities. But more importantly, while checking blogs someone recommended a book that I was interested in. I clicked through to Amazon and noticed that it was available in Kindle format. It would have been the perfect opportunity to buy it and start reading right away.</p>
<p>That is what the Kindle brings to the table. The hardware design is not an improvement over the Sony Reader (the Kindle&#8217;s keyboard remains a definite mistake), but the integration with Amazon and the convenient downloads from anywhere are both well implemented. I think Amazon has a history of tinkering in public view (home page design, shipping experiments), and the Kindle is no exception. They&#8217;re no doubt already working on version 2.</p>
