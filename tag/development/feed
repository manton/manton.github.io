				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I talked in &#8220;Core Intuition episode 22&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/2009/08/episode-22-not-just-a-hobby/ about how I&#8217;ve stopped working on my indie iPhone apps. Mike Ash is also done with it. &#8220;He writes&#8221;:http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/the-iphone-development-story-one-year-later.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have abandoned the platform. Apple&#8217;s nonsense is just too much for me. There&#8217;s no joy in iPhone development, and an enormous amount of frustration.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading through the comments got me thinking. I&#8217;m not abandoning the iPhone just because the App Store is such a frustrating environment to run a business in, or that I have a bunch of real work I could be doing instead of playing games with Apple. It&#8217;s also because most of the apps I would write have already been done, and in some cases done very well.</p>
<p>I love having a small computer in my pocket and mine is full of third-party apps. I&#8217;m thankful for the developers who are coming from other platforms and focusing all of their attention on the phone. And they are thrilled to be an a platform that is such a step up from traditional mobile development. The financial success stories of developers hitting on a great idea and it just taking off in the App Store are real and inspiring.</p>
<p>But the iPhone doesn&#8217;t need me.</p>
<p>As a user there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;ll give up the phone, but as a developer I can focus my time on &#8220;things that I have control over&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/, and add value to places where no one else has a good solution. Perceived gold rush or not, stretching myself too thin with both iPhone and Mac development is a great way to fail at both.</p>
<p>Imagine for a moment that &#8220;Yellow Box for Windows&#8221;:http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?YellowBox wasn&#8217;t killed off &mdash; that we could build Windows apps using Cocoa. Should I make my apps cross-platform just because it&#8217;s Objective-C? No. Writing software for a platform I don&#8217;t use would be like still supporting Mac OS X 10.2; there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to boot into that thing to test and fix my app.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a Mac developer, my message to you is the same: just because the iPhone is awesome and runs on Objective-C <em>does not mean you are required to build software for it</em>. Maybe your time would be better spent refining old apps or building new ones on the Mac. Maybe&#8230; the iPhone doesn&#8217;t need you, either.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every product needs a believer. Not on the product team, but outside. A champion beta tester. Someone who sees the potential and will offer such constructive criticism and feedback early on that if you don&#8217;t make the app perfect you will be personally letting them down.</p>
<p>This is so critical, that many products succeed or fail to reach 1.0 on this point alone. Without inspiration from your peers, it becomes difficult to push through &#8220;the dip&#8221;:http://sethgodin.typepad.com/the_dip/, the rough times in development when everything goes wrong and you can&#8217;t imagine how your app will ever see the light of day. Seek out that one person &mdash; friend, spouse, blogger, anyone &mdash; who will light a fire under you to ship a quality product.</p>
<p>Yes, I want to hear how much you like my app, but I also want to hear where it fails and frustrates you.</p>
<p>The feedback I&#8217;ve received for &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ is astonishingly well thought out and helpful. I like to think the app is attracting the best kind of customers: articulate and experienced enough to know what they want. If I could only implement half the suggestions to improve the app it will evolve into something great.</p>
<p>Of course, great beta testers only go so far. We still have to work really hard. &#8220;Merlin Mann said it best&#8221;:http://www.43folders.com/2009/03/11/kutiman: &#8220;The only person who can sit on your ass is you.&#8221;</p>
