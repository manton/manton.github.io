				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://devmate.com/mac-dev-survey">DevMate surveyed 679 Mac developers</a> to put together a report on who is using the Mac App Store vs. selling direct, what concerns developers have, which tools they use, and more. On why developers leave the Mac App Store:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If you’re thinking giving away 30% of your hard-earned revenue is the deal-breaker, you’d be surprised. Revenue share is not the main reason developers flee. The main reason is the long and unclear App Review process, closely followed by revshare and the absence of trial versions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While sandboxing does show up on the complaint list, it’s ranked low as a reason to not use the Mac App Store, even though <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html">it was why</a> I pulled my app Clipstart from the Mac App Store 4 years ago. And not much has changed since I wrote about Sketch and other apps leaving the Mac App Store <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/12/too-late-to-save-the-mas.html">last year</a>.</p>
<p>For anyone who has been following blog posts and conference talks about the Mac App Store, there won&#8217;t be many surprises in this new survey, but I found the details interesting. The survey appears to be a good snapshot of how the Mac community is feeling about selling software.</p>
