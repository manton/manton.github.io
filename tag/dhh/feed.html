				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been doing Ruby on Rails work again. Although my indie web projects are all Sinatra, I generally recommend to clients that Rails is the way to go. Rails will be easier for them if someone else ever needs to take over the project.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like using 2 products that do the same thing, though. That&#8217;s why I consolidated my web app hosting to Linode, and my source code to GitHub. Why should I switch between 2 frameworks, especially since Rails has matured so well? I&#8217;m enjoying Rails 5.</p>
<p>David Heinemeier Hansson said <a href="https://interviews.slashdot.org/story/16/08/30/1759216/the-slashdot-interview-with-ruby-on-rails-creator-david-heinemeier-hansson">in an interview on Slashdot</a>, about the rise of JavaScript front-end frameworks:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  But it seems like that&#8217;s one of the lessons people have to learn by themselves. Just try to string things together on your own a few times and you&#8217;ll quickly get an appreciation for what Rails provides as a backend framework. We&#8217;ve had tons of programmers try just that and come back for refuge.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It struck home because I&#8217;ve had some regrets with choosing Ember.js for my new app. Part of that is my own lack of experience with the framework. But also I&#8217;m no longer convinced that the heavily JavaScript-based view layout of something like Ember.js is better than <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>, for example. I plan to rewrite my app in Rails and more classic Ajax at the earliest opportunity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/provide-sharp-knives-cc0a22bf7934">David Heinemeier Hansson has a great post today</a> about Ruby’s advanced dynamic features. Some people would criticize Ruby (and Rails) for including “sharp knives in its drawer of features”, but David argues that it’s a worthwhile tradeoff to give developers such power and flexibility:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There’s nothing programmatically in Ruby to stop you using its sharp knives to cut ties with reason. We enforce such good senses by convention, by nudges, and through education. Not by banning sharp knives from the kitchen and insisting everyone use spoons to slice tomatoes.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/05/21/dynamic-swift-2/">recent discussions</a> from the Apple community, I couldn’t stop thinking of Swift as I read David’s post. I wouldn’t go as far as saying that Swift is a dull knife; there is a lot to like about the language, and I feel reasonably productive in it now. But David’s “paternalism” line nevertheless rings true to me, that the Swift compiler is trying to protect us from ourselves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;David Heinemeier Hansson writes in detail&#8221;:http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/21-the-deal-with-shared-hosts on the problems with Rails in shared hosts:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Most Rails contributors are not big users of shared hosting and they tend to work on problems or enhancements that&#8217;ll benefit their own usage of the framework. You don&#8217;t have to have a degree in formal logic to deduce that work to improve life on shared hosting is not exactly a top priority for these people, myself included.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve been building Rails apps for a couple years, and will continue to do so, I made the choice with &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ to go PHP-only so that I could deploy on inexpensive shared hosts and easily move my sites. Fact is, you need to dedicate a significant portion of your time to being a system administrator if you run a Rails site.</p>
<p>I find the general &#8220;we don&#8217;t owe you anything&#8221; attitude in the Rails community off-putting. What it means is quite simple: Rails is not a product, despite what it might look like when you &#8220;visit the web site&#8221;:http://www.rubyonrails.com/. This is fine and consistent with the opinionated nature of Rails (which from a design perspective is what makes Rails excellent), but it also means that features like backwards compatibility are not just ignored but actively discouraged. The message this sends is that the core team values their own personal productivity over the productivity of the general Rails userbase.</p>
<p>Also, make no mistake, the performance questions surrounding Rails are directly related to the web shared host issue. Rails can&#8217;t be hosted in the same way that PHP is hosted because it takes so long for a Rails application to be initialized, requiring dedicated long-running app instances and an ever-changing array of &#8220;best practice&#8221; solutions starting with mod_ruby to FCGI to Mongrel to &#8220;Thin&#8221;:http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/.</p>
<p>My friends and &#8220;co-workers&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ are no doubt sick of me bashing Rails (see &#8220;this post on the priorities of the community&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/09/rails_and_mac_dev.html), but I still admire Rails and do want to see these problems solved. I would love to use &#8220;PotionStore&#8221;:http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore to power the Riverfold site, or to base my registration database and sales tracking in Rails.</p>
