				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Moren had <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3115792/ios/hey-apple-it-s-time-to-rethink-icloud.html">an article at Macworld last week</a> about the price for iCloud storage. Most iPhone users quickly run out of space for a backup, but they don&#8217;t use iTunes either because iCloud is just much simpler:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Apple’s philosophy is about making its products seamless and easy to use. Encouraging people to use iCloud backup is, in most cases, smoother and simpler than having to back-up to a computer.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTrO2wUxh0Q">5 years ago</a> that Steve Jobs introduced iCloud and talked about demoting the computer from the central hub:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Keeping these devices in sync is driving us crazy. So, we&#8217;ve got a great solution for this problem. And we think this solution is our next big insight, which is we&#8217;re going to demote the PC and the Mac to just be a device. Just like an iPhone, an iPad, or an iPod Touch. And we&#8217;re going to move the digital hub — the center of your digital life — into the cloud.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I use iCloud backup exclusively, with only the occasional manual iTunes backup when I know I&#8217;m going to immediately restore from it, such as when upgrading to a new iPhone. I expect most new iPhone users rarely sync with iTunes, relegating iTunes to a playback app for their iTunes rentals and Apple Music subscription, but not much else.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s certainly the case for my family, at least. After some lost photos recently, I told the kids I would bump their allowance by $1 to cover everyone having at least 50 GB of iCloud storage. No more excuses.</p>
<p>Maybe it should be free, as Dan Moren argues above. Or maybe Apple could encourage upgrades by bundling extra iCloud storage with Apple Music and other popular services. But even today, at 99 cents, it&#8217;s a small price to pay for cloud backup that you never have to think about.</p>
