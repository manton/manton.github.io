				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2014/9/the_wilderness.html">Great post by Gus Mueller</a> on losing your way in a project:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ve been making foundational changes to your app. You&#8217;ve been spending time cleaning up your code, rewriting those hacks you&#8217;ve been wanting to fix for years now. Or you&#8217;re targeting a new SDK and there&#8217;s all these deprecated methods to replace. So while important change is happening, you don&#8217;t seem to be moving forward. You look up and all of a sudden notice this has been going on for weeks and you&#8217;ve been standing still all this time, and now you&#8217;re standing still for no reason at all. And you&#8217;re lost in the wilderness.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I work on several apps throughout the week, evenings, and weekend. Most people would say: too many apps. The only way I can possible keep up is if every minute that I&#8217;m at the keyboard I&#8217;m productive, on the right path to finishing the project. Usually I can do it. But even so, I frequently fall into exactly the wilderness Gus describes, losing valuable time off in the weeds on things that just don&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>The difference between those who can ship apps and those who indefinitely have a great idea that&#8217;s never complete often comes down to how much time we&#8217;re lost in the wilderness. By giving it a name we can recognize when it happens and hopefully recover more quickly.</p>
