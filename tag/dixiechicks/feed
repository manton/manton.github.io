The last few weeks of a project are always the most stressful, but also the most rewarding as all the pieces start to fall into place. The user interface tightens up and the bugs are found and worked out.</p>

It&#8217;s a lazy Saturday afternoon &#8212; a holiday weekend, even &#8212; but I have a bit more code to knock out. The new Dixie Chicks CD is playing, iChat is safely in the &#8220;off&#8221; position, and for another hour or so, everything in the world is just fine.</p>
