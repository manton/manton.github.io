				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/14/1382.html">Dave Winer has a good comment</a> for anyone questioning the web:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  So when they tell you they know for sure that the web is dead, or that everyone wants to host their blogs in locked-up silos, or that you can&#8217;t build a great open social net on RSS, you might want to lower your glasses down your nose and look out over the top and ask Reallly? Are you sure?? ;-)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Nothing is certain in business. For every success, there are many &#8220;sure thing&#8221; failures.</p>
<p>I posed a question on <a href="http://coreint.org/241">this week&#8217;s Core Intuition</a> as we were talking about Automattic&#8217;s upcoming <a href="https://dotblog.wordpress.com/">.blog</a> domain name registration. The gist of it was: what is more likely to survive for the next 50 years, Twitter or .blog? Twitter is huge, dominating the news and seemingly unstoppable, but social networks don&#8217;t have a great track record. I&#8217;d put my money on a new top-level domain, both because of the vision of empowering users to control their own content and also because domains were designed to last.</p>
<p>Companies aren&#8217;t exactly <em>designed</em> to fail. But that is their default outcome.</p>
