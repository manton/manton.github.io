				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a wonderful video of <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tech/watch-glen-keane-draw-ariel-and-the-beast-in-3d-119110.html">Glen Keane drawing with VR goggles</a>. I&#8217;ve been watching and listening to Glen explain animation for a long time, on bonus videos going back to my small collection of Disney feature LaserDiscs. It&#8217;s great to see him still in the spotlight after leaving Disney, and the great work he did on last year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9CG_PoEWCg">Duet</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Disney company, I really enjoyed last night&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/waltdisney">American Experience on Walt</a>. Part 2 airs tonight on PBS.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Shortly after posting this, <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/cartoon-brew-pick/nephtali-by-glen-keane-119359.html">a new film</a> from Glen Keane showed up in my newsreader. It&#8217;s a good month for animation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was wired when I got back at midnight last Thursday from the late Mission Impossible 3 show with &#8220;Damon&#8221;:http://www.damonclinkscales.com/. A storm had passed over while we were in the theater. Tree branches were down in the neighborhood, and rain continued.</p>
<p>I sat at the dining room table with a sheet of typing paper and a fat red kids crayon and did some characters. It&#8217;s hard to draw small with something so big. These were at least twice the diameter of your standard crayon. I shrunk the result slightly and included a few below because I liked some of the line, despite the otherwise clunkiness.</p>
