				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When &#8220;the iPad commercial&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/ipad/gallery/#hardware06 popped up during the Oscars, I thought it captured the power and elegance of the device extremely well. But as I commented on Twitter, after repeat viewings you can see that it&#8217;s probably faked. The iPad must have been filmed on a stand or table and then composited into the shot later.</p>
<p>Contrast this to &#8220;Cabel Sasser&#8217;s&#8221;:http://www.cabel.name/2006/03/nintendo-ds-lite-first-look.html video of the Nintendo DS Lite, which was a faithful presentation of how the game system feels to use and yet still &#8220;sold people on the device&#8221;:http://twitter.com/shauninman/status/10175596516.</p>
<p>Apple stretches the truth with all the iPod and iPhone ads and it never bothered me before, but this one seems wrong. How it feels to hold an iPad will be the difference between a good product and a great one. Can you hold it still with one hand? How easy is it to rotate it? What is the angle like when propping it on your legs?</p>
<p>This is a pretty minor complaint &mdash; I&#8217;ll be pre-ordering my iPad this Friday regardless and couldn&#8217;t be more excited &mdash; but I wish Apple didn&#8217;t feel the need to lie about such an important part of the product.</p>
