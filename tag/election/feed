				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Iowa kicks off the election today, I thought I’d offer my 2 cents on the campaign. I&#8217;m a strong Hillary Clinton supporter.</p>
<p><a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/30/0958.html">Dave Winer writes</a> that Hillary is what we need right now in terms of projecting a stable image to the rest of the world:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “At this moment, we need a solid hitter, someone who the rest of the world is comfortable with, and who a deeply injured Republican Party can work with.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s great to see the passionate Bernie Sanders supporters, too. I was fired up for Howard Dean in 2004, so I remember what that excitement is like. But I believe Hillary would be a great president.</p>
<p>Eight years ago I put together a short podcast episode about the campaign, trying to capture something from 2008. You can <a href="http://www.manton.org/2008/02/hillary_podcast.html">listen to it here</a>. My daughters — who were 7 years old at the time — make an appearance at the end of the episode. Now, of course, they’re 15, and the weight of time passing couldn&#8217;t be more clearly felt.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good line from Hillary in one of the first Democratic debates in 2015:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I&#8217;m a progressive. But I&#8217;m a progressive who likes to get things done.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that sums up what we can expect from a Hillary Clinton presidency. I have no idea what a Bernie Sanders presidency would look like — what it would accomplish — and I&#8217;m not sure he does either. My concern isn’t in the ideas, but in the execution against a politically calculating, Republican congress.</p>
<p>Bernie and Hillary share something in a fighting attitude, though. Neither candidate will let the Republicans walk over them. If you don’t think Hillary’s got this, re-watch <a href="http://www.c-span.org/video/?280557-17/senator-hillary-clinton-2008-convention-speech">her speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Need something to listen to on your iPod while waiting in line to vote today? Try out these fantastic recent episodes of two of my favorite podcasts for animators and animation fans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spline Cast with Ed Catmull&#8221;:http://splinedoctors.blogspot.com/2007/11/original-spline-doctor.html. I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;ve followed the careers of John Lasseter and Steve Jobs a lot closer than I have for Ed Catmull, but this podcast shows pretty clearly the depth of impact Ed Catmull has had on the computer industry and the Pixar culture. It&#8217;s a great listen not just for anyone who cares about animation, but also for entrepreneurs who want a look into how you stay successful year after year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Animation Podcast with James Baxter&#8221;:http://animationpodcast.com/archives/2008/02/04/james-baxter-part-one/. There are many great animators, from well known independents who receive Oscar recognition to those who work 12-hour days in relative obscurity at a big studio, but there are only a handful of true masters of the art form. Baxter is one of my favorites. The powerful sequence with Moses and the burning bush and the mannerism of Belle fixing her hair were both always really memorable for me.</p>
<p>Enjoy! Happy Super Tuesday.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Obama is passionate, thoughtful, centrist enough for broad appeal, and a brilliant speaker. If he&#8217;s the nominee I&#8217;ll support him fully with every bit of strength I have. There is something special about him, and it comes around rarely in a candidate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave Winer wrote&#8221;:http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/01/08/gluedToTheTv.html: &#8220;Obama, like Carter in 1976, may be our pennance for having re-elected Bush in 2004. We&#8217;re taking the medicine we deserve for having been crazy enough to re-elect someone who was so bad for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what about Hillary? She&#8217;s part of the establishment, and I volunteered heavily for the Howard Dean campaign. Could I support someone as traditional as Hillary? As &#8220;Mike Cohen said&#8221;:http://mcdevzone.com/2008/01/08/bad-news-from-new-hampshire: &#8220;I oppose her very strongly, not only because of all the baggage she brings, but for her anti-progressive record.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I posted to Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/578006692 on election night that something had changed between the Iowa vote and New Hampshire: Hillary had found her voice, and it surprised me. Turns out she knows what is at stake. I always knew she was a fighter; after 2000 and 2004, we need the Democrats to show some backbone again. But I think she&#8217;s been underestimated even more deeply than that, in her ability to speak to the core Democratic base while drawing upon her new experience and record in the Senate that most people aren&#8217;t familiar with yet.</p>
<p>And then there is the woman factor. Some people will say this matters but they don&#8217;t really understand unless they have daughters of their own, daughters who will grow up and become teenagers, the defining moment of their lives, during a woman presidency. This is both personal and huge and it could spread like wildfire. For me, it tips the balance.</p>
<p>My family is throwing its support &mdash; our money for donations, our phones for getting out the vote, and our voice &mdash; behind Hillary. Thank you New Hampshire for making this a real primary election again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I couldn&#8217;t let the 5th anniversary of September 11th pass without saying something. On Friday &#8220;the Senate intelligence committee released a report&#8221;:http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/washington/09intelcnd.html showing that there was no link between Saddam Hussein and 9/11. That isn&#8217;t news. What is news is the details: that Saddam actually <em>distrusted</em> Al Qaeda and tried to <em>capture</em> Zarqawi. The simple truth is that terrorist organizations are a threat to any government, even ones we have disagreements with.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#8217;t make you sick, here&#8217;s another one that I haven&#8217;t heard mentioned yet. Sometime next year the number of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq will <em>surpass the civilian deaths on September 11th</em>. (September 11th = 2973, Iraq as of today = 2661)</p>
<p>The level of incompetence in our President, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and their advisors reaches new heights. What can we do? Five years ago we were uneducated and scared, and even two years later we could easily be led by fear alone. Now, just stay angry. Change starts in November.</p>
