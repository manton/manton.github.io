				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/03/apple-shifts-focuses-from-small-products-to-big-issues/">Dan Moren writes for Six Colors</a> about the structure for the 1-hour Apple event today, of which only about half the time was spent on new products:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;If the Apple-FBI fight isn’t yet about public opinion, it probably will be if the matter ends up going to Congress. So it’s no surprise that Tim Cook is going to use his bully pulpit to push Apple’s track record on the welfare of its customers and the world at large, rather than how many products it’s sold and how much money it’s made.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see this continue at future events. Leave the record sales numbers for the finance call, and instead focus on what good Apple is doing <em>because</em> they are big, not just <em>how</em> they are big. Even though I own some Apple stock, I do not personally care that much about the precise magnitude of iPhone shipments this quarter.</p>
<p>As for the new products, nothing to complain about. Since the $10,000 Apple Watch Edition didn&#8217;t get a $50-dollar price drop like the Apple Watch Sport did, guess I&#8217;ll skip that purchase and get an iPhone SE instead.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve now wrapped up the first week of my attempt to visit a new coffee shop I’ve never been to, every day for a month. To track the progress, I’ve <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">created a web page</a> with all the visits so far, the coffee shops I hope to try soon, and also a bunch of places I’ve already been over the years (and so which are disqualified from this endeavor).</p>
<p>This has required a little more planning than I expected. I’ll be going to all corners of the city to not repeat myself for a full 30 days. Even then, I’ll have to broaden my search to include more traditional cafes and donut shops too.</p>
<p>I’ve also realized that I need to do a better job of ordering something unique when it’s on the menu, or asking for a recommendation. After all, the point is to get out of the house more often — to take a break from the isolated work-from-home environment, be exposed to something new, even if it’s just a simple drink or view outside, and get back to my current projects refreshed.</p>
