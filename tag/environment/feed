				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hardest transition for fans of Apple Computer from the 1990s is realizing that Apple <em>no longer needs us to defend the company</em>. If I&#8217;m sometimes critical of Apple, both here and on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re the largest tech company in the world.</p>
<p>I will always hold Apple to a very high standard of excellence. They&#8217;ve earned it. When airline flight attendants tell passengers to turn their <a href="http://pxlnv.com/linklog/galaxy-note-7-faa/">Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones off</a> along with the usual warnings about oxygen masks and life vests, we shrug and laugh because it&#8217;s Samsung. From Apple, we expect higher quality and attention to detail, not shortcuts.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs has been gone for 5 years, but the spirit of building insanely great products is well-rooted at Apple. Apple employees are doing incredible, passionate work.</p>
<p>And yet the company itself hardly resembles the struggling computer maker of 20 years ago. Apple is a giant corporation now. Unlike its employees, who have the best intentions, giant corporations are by default selfish, arrogant, and rarely courageous.</p>
<p>Apple does a lot of good for the world. I doubt there&#8217;s another company even approaching Apple&#8217;s size that <a href="http://www.apple.com/environment/">does as much</a>, from renewable energy to safer materials to workplace diversity. But that good doesn&#8217;t absolve them of criticism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/03/apple-shifts-focuses-from-small-products-to-big-issues/">Dan Moren writes for Six Colors</a> about the structure for the 1-hour Apple event today, of which only about half the time was spent on new products:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;If the Apple-FBI fight isn’t yet about public opinion, it probably will be if the matter ends up going to Congress. So it’s no surprise that Tim Cook is going to use his bully pulpit to push Apple’s track record on the welfare of its customers and the world at large, rather than how many products it’s sold and how much money it’s made.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see this continue at future events. Leave the record sales numbers for the finance call, and instead focus on what good Apple is doing <em>because</em> they are big, not just <em>how</em> they are big. Even though I own some Apple stock, I do not personally care that much about the precise magnitude of iPhone shipments this quarter.</p>
<p>As for the new products, nothing to complain about. Since the $10,000 Apple Watch Edition didn&#8217;t get a $50-dollar price drop like the Apple Watch Sport did, guess I&#8217;ll skip that purchase and get an iPhone SE instead.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve now wrapped up the first week of my attempt to visit a new coffee shop I’ve never been to, every day for a month. To track the progress, I’ve <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">created a web page</a> with all the visits so far, the coffee shops I hope to try soon, and also a bunch of places I’ve already been over the years (and so which are disqualified from this endeavor).</p>
<p>This has required a little more planning than I expected. I’ll be going to all corners of the city to not repeat myself for a full 30 days. Even then, I’ll have to broaden my search to include more traditional cafes and donut shops too.</p>
<p>I’ve also realized that I need to do a better job of ordering something unique when it’s on the menu, or asking for a recommendation. After all, the point is to get out of the house more often — to take a break from the isolated work-from-home environment, be exposed to something new, even if it’s just a simple drink or view outside, and get back to my current projects refreshed.</p>
