				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I watched two documentaries last week. The first was <a href="http://www.magpictures.com/stevejobsthemaninthemachine/">&#8220;Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine&#8221;</a>, which I somewhat regret paying $7 to rent. It had its moments, but also seemed to become more negative and dramatic the longer it went on. I guess we should all hope to be so lucky and famous to have people try to bring out the best and worst of us.</p>
<p>The second documentary I watched was <a href="http://www.netflix.com/title/80042198">&#8220;Atari: Game Over&#8221;</a>, which was free on Netflix. It was great, interspersing a history of the rise and fall of Atari with the effort to dig up the ET game cartridges supposedly buried in New Mexico. Highly recommended.</p>
