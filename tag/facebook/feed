				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twitter has retweets. Facebook has sharing. But Instagram has no built-in reposting. On Instagram, there&#8217;s no instantaneous way to share someone else&#8217;s post to all of your followers.</p>
<p>The first version of Instagram was built by a very small team. They&#8217;ve always grown slowly and expanded the UI thoughtfully. I think the lack of a repost feature was deliberate.</p>
<p>When you have to put a little work into posting, you take it more seriously. I wonder if <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/11/todays-social-networks-are-broken.html">fake news</a> would have spread so quickly on Facebook if it was a little more difficult to share an article before you&#8217;ve read more than the headline.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy to build software that encourages good behavior. When I look at my Instagram timeline I see beautiful photos, hand-drawn art, and snapshots of everyday life. I see the very best of the world. It&#8217;s not the full truth, but it&#8217;s all true.</p>
<p>Instagram was no accident. The only question: was it unique to photos, or can the same quality be applied to microblogging?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://waxy.org/2016/11/redesigning-waxy-2016-edition/">Andy Baio redesigned his blog recently</a> and argued that blogs still matter because of ownership and control. Of course, I agree. And though it may seem far off, there&#8217;s no guarantee that Twitter will outlast our own blogs. Andy writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Twitter, itself, may be acquired and changed in some terrible way. It’s not hard to imagine a post-Verizon Yahoo selling off Tumblr. Medium keeps pivoting, trying to find a successful revenue model. There’s no guarantee any of these platforms will be around in their current state in a year, let alone ten years from now.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ben Brooks <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/11/a-new-waxyorg/">followed up</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Having my own site gives me complete control to do whatever I want, whenever I want, however I want. I don’t understand why people ever want it any other way.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Words are powerful. Especially right now, why let anyone else have control over the format of our words and how they spread? Having a blog is a statement: our writing exists apart from the whim of an algorithmic news feed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2016/11/09/on_leaving_twitter">Brent Simmons has left Twitter</a>, frustrated with the diminishing value of the service, Twitter&#8217;s inability to deal with harassment, and more:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  And then it was part of the system that helped elect a fascist President. This tipped it over for me: it’s no longer worth my participation. The shitheads can have it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Facebook has also been in the news for <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/11/09/facebook-kill-news-feed-trump/">its role in letting fake news spread</a>. Ben Thompson has <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/fake-news/">a long essay this week on it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I get why top-down solutions are tempting: fake news and filter bubbles are in front of our face, and wouldn’t it be better if Facebook fixed them? The problem is the assumption that whoever wields that top-down power will just so happen to have the same views I do. What, though, if they don’t?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe. Though while we should debate how to balance Facebook&#8217;s enormous power, there should be a parallel effort to move away from the centralized publishing model that gave Facebook that power.</p>
<p>Facebook has confused itself into thinking it is the whole internet, and so the principles of a free press that apply to the open web, also must apply to Facebook. No. While Facebook has a great responsibility to do the right thing, because they are so big, Facebook is just a web site.</p>
<p>I want Facebook to improve. I want Twitter to improve. But I can do very little to effect change at those companies, and some problems are so fundamental as to be essentially unfixable. The web wasn&#8217;t supposed to be like this, with all the power and all the writing concentrated into so few sites.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for a new social network that brings discoverability and community without the baggage of an ad-driven network that must grow to a billion users. A social network that embraces the open web, and freedom of expression, while preserving a clean timeline that can&#8217;t be interrupted by harassment.</p>
<p>Not just one new social network. I hope that many developers will work on products that encourage independent publishing again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to take time to build. That&#8217;s why I started working on <a href="http://snippets.today/">Snippets.today</a> 2 years ago. I&#8217;ve made great progress, but I&#8217;ve also drifted, unfocused, uncommitted to finishing it, as if I knew something was missing.</p>
<p>Something <em>was</em> missing. The election results have made that clear. I was thinking big, but not big enough. The way forward must include both a decentralized publishing platform and the tools to encourage a safe community.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to know when the beta is finally ready, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">subscribe to the announce list</a>. Thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/02/app-review-for-the-fast-web.html">Maybe I misjudged</a> Facebook’s Instant articles. <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/24/1054.html">Dave Winer</a> is a supporter, because it builds on RSS:</p>

  “Facebook is using open web technology to power Instant Articles. I&#8217;m not sharing anything that isn&#8217;t already publicly documented on the Facebook developer site. People have trouble understanding this, I assume, because it seems so out of character for a big web destination like Facebook to care about the open web. It&#8217;s kind of a miracle. But there it is. The open web is about to get a real shot in the arm from a most unexpected place.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess one question is whether there will be any other RSS readers that support Instant Articles. If we can get some of the benefits of Instant Articles, but outside of Facebook, that is something.</p>

<p>That’s just what we need: the worst part of the App Store approval process applied to the web. No thanks.</p>
<p>Google’s competing Accelerated Mobile Pages has problems too, as I mentioned in the last half of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/twitter-and-the-cost-of-links.html">this post about the cost of links</a>. Although unlike Facebook, which wants to trap content behind their own platform, AMP is at least more open and useful to the larger web.</p>
<p>I hate to say it but neither Instant Articles nor AMP are really good enough. I think we need a third standard for super-fast web pages. (Or do we? Maybe the web is okay as-is if we <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">fight page bloat</a>.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.parse.com/announcements/moving-on/">Bad news from the Parse team</a> at Facebook today:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We have a difficult announcement to make. Beginning today we’re winding down the Parse service, and Parse will be fully retired after a year-long period ending on January 28, 2017. We’re proud that we’ve been able to help so many of you build great mobile apps, but we need to focus our resources elsewhere.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>For years I had always heard great things about Parse. I eventually used it for the first time a few months ago on a client project. It’s got a well-designed API, friendly monthly pricing (free for many apps), and it seemed well supported, with new features like tvOS support and a web dashboard redesign rolling out <em>just a month ago</em>.</p>
<p>Thinking about <a href="https://twitter.com/danielpunkass/status/692845189816123392">this tweet from Daniel Jalkut</a>, I&#8217;ve always advocated for iOS developers to also be good at web services. Customers expect sync everywhere now, and you can do things with your own server that will give you an advantage over competitors who have a simpler, standalone iOS app. But being forced to migrate server data isn’t fun, especially on someone else’s schedule.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hossein Derakhshan spent 6 years in jail in Iran because of his blog. Now, with the clarity of seeing years of changes to the web and social networks all at once after his release, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/29/irans-blogfather-facebook-instagram-and-twitter-are-killing-the-web">he&#8217;s written an important essay</a> on the value of hyperlinks and the open web:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;When a powerful website – say Google or Facebook – gazes at, or links to, another webpage, it doesn’t just connect it , it brings it into existence; gives it life. Without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn’t breathe. No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it, it is actually both dead and blind, and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>He mentions apps like Instagram, which have no way to link to the outside world. Too many apps are exactly like this: more interested in capturing eyeballs for ads than opening up their platform. The default for native mobile apps is to become silos, while the default for web sites is to be open and support linking.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a second part to Hossein&#8217;s essay that I don&#8217;t agree with, though. He writes that &#8220;the stream&#8221; – a.k.a the timeline, a reverse-chronological list of short posts or links – is turning the web into television. But I think there&#8217;s a lot we can learn from the timeline. It&#8217;s a valuable user experience metaphor that we should take back from Twitter and social networks.</p>
<p>Building on the timeline is basically the whole point of my microblogging project. We should encourage independent microblogs by using a timeline interface to make them more useful. (Interested? <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">Sign up</a> on my announce list.)</p>
<p>Back to links. Dave Winer, who has been cross-posting recently to Facebook and Medium, <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/03/0783.html">posted about</a> how Facebook doesn&#8217;t allow inline links in the text of a post. As a new generation grows up on these kind of posts instead of real blog posts, will people understand what they&#8217;re missing? Dave writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t end up having to try to explain linking to future generations who have no recollection of an electronic writing environment where words could take you to a whole other place. But I suspect we&#8217;re going there. Unless somehow we can get Facebook to relent and make it easy to link from words in Facebook posts to other places on the web.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a great challenge for 2016. Not specifically with Facebook, but with the larger idea of bringing back <a href="http://anildash.com/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">the web we lost</a>, retrofitted for today&#8217;s app-centric internet. I hope to spend a good part of the year working on it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/twitter-market/">an essay about Twitter written in 2014</a>, Ben Thompson described why he believed in the service:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I think this actually gets to the problem with Twitter: the initial concept was <em>so good</em>, and so perfectly fit such a large market, that they never needed to go through the process of achieving product market fit. It just happened, and they’ve been riding that match for going on eight years.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve always thought the same thing. That Twitter started out so good, with such strong core features, that those basic features have carried it through all the years of missteps and inaction. But it&#8217;s not just that the features are &#8220;good&#8221; (although they are); it&#8217;s that they are <em>unique</em>.</p>
<p>Listening to the <a href="http://www.relay.fm/connected/64">Connected podcast</a> the other day, Federico Viticci and Myke Hurley made the statement that only nerds care about Twitter changing stars to hearts, favorites to likes. I was nodding in agreement until I talked to my daughter. She also didn&#8217;t understand why they would change away from stars, and she&#8217;s been on Twitter less than a year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just nerds. Many new Twitter users recognize the subtle difference implied with hearts. But I realized that there&#8217;s something even more important about what this change says. Why is my daughter even on Twitter, in addition to Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and Vine? Because — even if most people can&#8217;t pin down exactly what makes it special — everyone knows Twitter is different and interesting.</p>
<p>All Twitter has going for it is its uniqueness. The timeline user experience, the retweets and favorites, the hashtag, and the short 140 character posts. Changing any of those key strengths to be just like every other social network means they&#8217;re watering down their own potential impact. Eventually that approach will produce a bland product that has no unique qualities.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already seen the timeline experience significantly altered. Promoted tweets, &#8220;while you were away&#8221;, inline conversation threads, and Twitter cards. Twitter in 2015 looks a lot more like Facebook than it did a few years ago, to everyone not using third-party Twitter apps.</p>
<p>Growing the user base is fine. But making Twitter more accessible to new users won&#8217;t do any good if you lose the much larger base of passionate users who have loved the product for years <em>because it&#8217;s unique</em>.
