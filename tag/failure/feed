				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seth Godin on an &#8220;exhibit for Tim Burton&#8221;:http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/unrealized-projects.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the guy who&#8217;s responsible for some of the most breathtaking movies of his generation, and the real surprise is this: almost every year over the last thirty, he worked on one or more exciting projects that were never green lighted and produced. _Every year, he spent an enormous amount of time on failed projects._&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of thing I&#8217;ll try to remember when I look at the apps I&#8217;ve started but never shipped, even as they sit very close to finished for a year or more. Almost everyone I know who has successful products also has experiments and failed prototypes and unfinished work you&#8217;ve never heard of. That&#8217;s okay as long as it doesn&#8217;t stop you from shipping the best and making those real.</p>
<p>I have a lot to announce this week. Posts on a new Wii Transfer, the Indie Relief effort, and Macworld all coming up.</p>
