				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/12/twitter-at-10-years.html">In yesterday&#8217;s essay about Twitter</a>, I also linked to my post on Instagram&#8217;s lack of native reposts. <a href="http://nearthespeedoflight.com/article/2016_12_02_fake_news_on_social_networks">Jason Brennan has written a follow-up</a> about fake news and propaganda, exploring what we can learn and apply to microblogging:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Aside from the normal reasons propaganda exists, it exists on social networks like Facebook and Twitter because it <em>can exist</em> on those networks. It’s <em>profitable</em> and <em>useful</em> for the parties manufacturing and disseminating it. To Facebook and Twitter, upon whose networks it propagates, it doesn’t really matter what the information is so long as it <em>engages</em> users. Facebook’s apathy to propaganda is regularly exploited.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hillary Clinton also connected fake news and propaganda <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/08/hillary-clinton-attacks-fake-news-in-post-election-appearance-on-capitol-hill/">in a speech this week</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Let me just mention briefly one threat in particular that should concern all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents alike, especially those who serve in our Congress: the epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year. It’s now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The internet is at a crossroads. Entrepreneurs love free speech, scale, and money, but those don&#8217;t always align in a good way. As much talk as there is of <em>making an impact</em>, very few leaders in Silicon Valley seem to think deeply about consequences.</p>
