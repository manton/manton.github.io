				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2013/11/08/five-years-in-the-app-store/">David Smith wrote last week</a> on the 5-year anniversary of shipping his first iPhone app. I started following David’s work in the middle this story — after he had started the Developing Perspective podcast, but before he created Check the Weather and Feed Wrangler — so it’s especially great to see such a nice, reflective post that fills in the earlier apps. On launching and scaling Feed Wrangler:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “In retrospect, it was one of the toughest challenges and most trying times of my career. The relentless dual-pronged attack of late nights and urgent work made it crushing physically and psychologically. Now that things have settled down, I can look back and be glad that I went through it. The kind of things you learn in that kind of crucible can’t be easily recreated.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I could read these kind of posts every day. Also last week, when Gus Mueller announced that he was selling VoodooPad, I remembered as I was <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2013/11/episode-112-it-wasnt-done-enough/">talking with Daniel on Core Intuition 112</a> that Gus’s similar <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/25.html">blog post from 2005</a> is still interesting and relevant today.</p>
