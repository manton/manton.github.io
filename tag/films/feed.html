				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://scottknaster.blogspot.com/2015/10/when-steve-jobs-movie-came-calling.html">Scott Knaster blogged about</a> his day advising the crew of the new Steve Jobs movie:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Every room had things taped up on the walls. Giant blown up pictures of the different events they were going to re-create. One entire wall was nothing but <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=old+mac+bomb+boxes&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1139&amp;bih=986&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMI_Ia0q76ryAIVxn2ICh2mqgvl#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=old+mac+bomb+errors">ancient Mac error messages</a>. Another was photos of buildings where different Apple events happened. One wall had pictures from the Internet of random Apple employees from the &#8217;80s.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple seems intent on downplaying this movie as inaccurate and unfair to Steve, but it&#8217;s not supposed to be a documentary. It&#8217;s promising that they asked Scott Knaster for help getting some of the everyday details right. I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we start 2009, I continue to be inspired by what independent artists and developers are able to create with limited resources. Here&#8217;s one example.</p>
<p>Roger Ebert recently &#8220;posted a thoughtful review&#8221;:http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/12/having_wonderful_time_wish_you.html of animator Nina Paley&#8217;s independent feature Sita Sings the Blues. Paley is still in a small bit of copyright trouble with the songs and is trying to &#8220;creatively find a way out&#8221;:http://blog.ninapaley.com/2008/12/28/sitas-distribution-plan/. The copyright problem was news to me. I subscribe to Paley&#8217;s blog but haven&#8217;t been keeping up with it lately.</p>
<p>Early in 2008 I invited Paley to screen her films at &#8220;STAPLE!&#8221;:http://www.staple-austin.org/, but she was busy finishing Sita and preparing for its premiere in Europe. She has some great older shorts too, including one of the first Flash to QuickTime animated shorts I remember seeing, Fetch, which was linked years ago off Hotwired&#8217;s defunct animation site.</p>
<p>(Speaking of STAPLE!, &#8220;Stan Sakai&#8221;:http://www.staple-austin.org/guests/ will be our guest in March. If you are in the Austin area, please stop by.)</p>
<p>Sita Sings the Blues will find an audience eventually. I gave some money as Paley was soliciting donations to finish the feature, and I know I&#8217;m not the only one inspired by what she&#8217;s created. Making an indie feature film is an amazing accomplishment.</p>
