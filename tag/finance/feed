				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Gus Mueller&#8221;:http://gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2009/08/setting_the_right_priorities.html, in response to a post from Joel Spolsky:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If no one is buying your app then you&#8217;ve either got a dud and you need to focus on something else, or you need to improve your app so it&#8217;s worth paying for.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I hinted at this in &#8220;my last post about new Clipstart features&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/08/clipstart_12_ships.html. When Clipstart 1.0 launched and sales were lower than I had secretly hoped, the feedback was still so encouraging that it was obvious I had to keep rolling out new versions. Release 1.1, a month later. Release 1.2, which is &#8220;shipping today&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/.</p>
<p>Some products are just easier to sell than others. For Wii Transfer, people enter &#8220;music wii mac&#8221; in Google and then a few minutes later they are clicking the Buy button on my web site. But with Clipstart, even though I believe it to be a superior product, it&#8217;s going to take work and marketing and word-of-mouth and demo coaxing and making it so good that you&#8217;d be nuts to shoot video and not have it installed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started reading the &#8220;Get Rich Slowly&#8221;:http://www.getrichslowly.org/ blog last year and it has quickly become one of my favorites. Don&#8217;t let the name fool you &mdash; it&#8217;s really just about practical advice for paying off debt, keeping a budget, and saving money for retirement. The author hits that perfect blogging voice that feels very authentic, as if he and his readers are peers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This recent post&#8221;:http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2009/01/05/9-methods-for-mastering-your-money-in-2009/ to start off 2009 covers all the major goals of the site. Here&#8217;s a snippet from budgeting:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are a variety of budgeting methods you can choose, from Andrew Tobias&#8217; three-step budget to the 60% budget. My recent favorite (and a favorite of GRS readers) is Elizabeth Warren&#8217;s balanced money formula: 50% to Needs, 20% to Savings, and everything else to Wants. Simple but effective.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think there&#8217;s something for just about anyone in his blog, whether you are paying off a mountain of credit card debt or starting as an entrepreneur who wants to keep enough cash in the bank to cover those slow months.</p>
