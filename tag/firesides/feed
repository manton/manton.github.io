				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday <a href="http://firesid.es/Chat/billkunz">Bill Kunz was interviewed on Firesides</a>, talking about his app Felix, and life as an indie developer vs. at a startup. Bill was especially open about how he used his own savings to build Felix, and some of the planning problems he ran into:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “One thing I would do differently &#8211; and this is probably going to come out wrong &#8211; but I would have stuck to my guns on my own plans better. I added quite a few niche features that ultimately ended up not being used, when I could have spent that time on the core of the app, or other projects. I burned a lot, lot, lot of time on things I ultimately didn’t need to.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Firesides is a very nice use of App.net. You can browse chat transcripts from previous guests without signing in, or sign in with App.net to ask questions when there’s a chat taking place. It’s a little like Reddit’s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/">Ask Me Anything</a>, but more readable and visually appealing, and built on the App.net messaging platform.</p>
