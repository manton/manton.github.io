				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/12/apple-watch-follow-up">Stephen Hackett posted</a> an Apple Watch follow-up recently. He has mostly stopped wearing it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The Apple Watch can do a lot of neat things, and I miss its fitness tracking, but so much of it just doesn&#8217;t fit my lifestyle anymore. It&#8217;s not super useful for work, apps are still miserably slow and at times, its an additional distraction.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Apple Watch is a very personal device. It&#8217;s okay that it&#8217;s not for everyone. There&#8217;s no network effect; the watch isn&#8217;t better or worse if other people don&#8217;t use it. And it&#8217;s even okay if most of the apps are too slow to bother with. Fitness tracking, notifications, the time — for me, those 3 simple features are enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2015/12/17/apple-watch-revisited">Casey Liss also writes</a> that notifications have been one of the most important features, letting him keep his iPhone ringer off:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The Apple Watch has allowed my iPhone to transition from being a <em>personal</em> device to being a <em>private</em> one. That’s a really profound change. More so than I expected.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Once every couple of months, I leave the house in a hurry and forget to put my Apple Watch on. I survive without it, of course, but I do miss it. After not wearing a watch for most of my life, it&#8217;s weird now if I don&#8217;t have the Apple Watch with me. I expect to use it for years to come.</p>
