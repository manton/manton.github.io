				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.twitterflight.com/">Twitter&#8217;s new mobile developer conference</a> is tomorrow. <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/10/20/wsj-twitter-peace-offering">Marco Arment writes</a> about whether developers should give Twitter another chance:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Twitter started out as a developer-friendly company, then they became a developer-hostile company, and now they’re trying to be a developer-friendly company again. If I had to pick a company to have absolute power over something very important, Twitter wouldn’t be very high on the list.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2014/10/21/whyISayYesToTwitter.html">Dave Winer responds</a> that for now, we&#8217;ll be okay trusting Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Twitter is not going to screw us in the short term. They need us as much as we need them. Independent developers are where wholly new ideas come from. You can&#8217;t hire people to do that to work inside companies.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The unique tragedy with Twitter&#8217;s changing attitude toward developers is that so many of Twitter&#8217;s early innovations <a href="http://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/">did come from third-party developers</a>. The new leadership displayed an incredible disrespect for the value developers added to both the ecosystem and core platform.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in the &#8220;short term&#8221; it&#8217;s still happening. Not 4 years ago, not 2 years ago — just <em>1 month ago</em>, TwitPic announced they are shutting down after a legal threat from Twitter. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/twitpic-and-whats-next.html">It&#8217;s a loss for the web</a>, leaving millions of broken image links in old tweets. This latest third-party developer casualty from Twitter&#8217;s policies comes practically on the eve of their new developer conference.</p>
<p>I agree with Dave&#8217;s larger points, though, on mirroring content to your own blog in addition to Twitter and Facebook. His <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a> is a step forward for RSS and the open web while still embracing social networks. We need more tools like it.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/manton/status/254228056657494016">2 years ago</a> I chose to stop tweeting from my personal Twitter account as a minor protest. I don&#8217;t expect everyone else to take such an extreme stance. We can agree on open formats and the power of microblogging while disagreeing on how to interact with Twitter.</p>
<p>(Skeptics say that leaving Twitter is a pointless gesture, like a pebble thrown into a river. The timeline flows on and the outrage is washed away as if it didn&#8217;t happen. If leaving doesn&#8217;t make an impact, why bother? But it does matter. It matters not for the change it creates directly for others, but for how it changed me. In the same way that writing an essay will solidify your thoughts on a subject, posting that last tweet has given me a new clarity from which to judge whether my own products are on the right track, living up to my ideals.)</p>
<p>Back to the present. On the flight up to Çingleton and back, I finally got around to reading the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847087/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591847087&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mantonorg&amp;linkId=B2NMWRQKBXSK7MCT">Hatching Twitter</a>. Since I was on Twitter near the beginning, I remember many events covered in the book: the launch at SXSW, the CEO shuffling, the names of early engineers who I&#8217;ve crossed paths with. I love how the book blends together things that I know are real with other details that must be more contrived or exaggerated, creating an engaging read that would seem to border on historical fiction if we didn&#8217;t know that it was basically all true.</p>
<p>Hatching Twitter captures the power struggles inside Twitter and fills a book with them. And that&#8217;s really the foundation for Marco&#8217;s post: based on Twitter&#8217;s history, we probably haven&#8217;t seen the last leadership change at the company. Twitter <em>might</em> have a strong future but it surely has an uncertain one.</p>
<p>My next product is about microblogging, and it has to launch in the real world where Twitter dominates. But I view that as a reality, not a feature requirement. I think I&#8217;ll be happier as a developer, and my app will actually be more compelling, if I design and build it for a world without Twitter.</p>
