				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve said before that there&#8217;s something about the 140-character limit that brings out both the best and worst in people. <a href="https://nickharris.wordpress.com/2016/01/20/twitter/">Nick Harris hints at this</a> while writing about taking a break from Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;But largely ignoring the Twitter Noise Machine – particularly when my timeline becomes the Twitter Hate Machine – is going to be good for me.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>He also talks about the obsession with stats and follower counts, which <a href="http://inessential.com/2016/01/20/nick_on_twitter">Brent Simmons picks up on</a> and carries further:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I did have Google Analytics for a few months in 2014 when I was doing sponsorships. I spent too much time looking at the numbers and trying to make them go up. But no amount of going-up is ever satisfying: I just wanted more.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>When designing my new microblogging platform, I made a conscious decision to <em>not even show follower counts</em>. You can get the followers from the API, but I didn&#8217;t want to have the numbers right in your face when viewing someone&#8217;s profile. It&#8217;s too easy for us to make a judgement based on how many followers they have, and so miss out on whatever they have to say.</p>
