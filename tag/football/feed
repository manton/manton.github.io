				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2223990/">Draft Day</a> doesn’t really have any business being good, but somehow it is anyway. I don’t even like football that much — who has time for it when there’s basketball? — but I’ve now seen this movie several times and love it. The movie actually gets better instead of worse on multiple viewings.</p>
<p>It also has a number of memorable lines. One of them is this, said by Kevin Costner’s character about the college football star who everyone thinks is the next greatest thing: “I think he’s a bust.” Five simple words that undo all momentum.</p>
<p>And unfortunately that’s still how I feel about Swift. I’m following <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/07/19/secret_projects_diary_3_decision_to_ma">Brent’s blog posts about learning Swift</a> and I’m trying to come to terms with whether to adopt the language, and I finally got it. I already have a capable quarterback in Objective-C, and I’m not ready to rebuild my roster yet, risking everything on a young language with so much promise but less real-world success.</p>
<p>No matter <a href="https://twitter.com/jakemarsh/status/623569038069878784">how much Swift has improved</a>, no matter how much everyone fawns over it, I still can’t shake the feeling that it’s a hype that <em>someone else’s</em> team needs. For me, it won&#8217;t end up solving the problems I have when building apps. For me, it’s a bust.</p>
