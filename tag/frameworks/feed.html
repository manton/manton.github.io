				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been doing Ruby on Rails work again. Although my indie web projects are all Sinatra, I generally recommend to clients that Rails is the way to go. Rails will be easier for them if someone else ever needs to take over the project.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like using 2 products that do the same thing, though. That&#8217;s why I consolidated my web app hosting to Linode, and my source code to GitHub. Why should I switch between 2 frameworks, especially since Rails has matured so well? I&#8217;m enjoying Rails 5.</p>
<p>David Heinemeier Hansson said <a href="https://interviews.slashdot.org/story/16/08/30/1759216/the-slashdot-interview-with-ruby-on-rails-creator-david-heinemeier-hansson">in an interview on Slashdot</a>, about the rise of JavaScript front-end frameworks:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  But it seems like that&#8217;s one of the lessons people have to learn by themselves. Just try to string things together on your own a few times and you&#8217;ll quickly get an appreciation for what Rails provides as a backend framework. We&#8217;ve had tons of programmers try just that and come back for refuge.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It struck home because I&#8217;ve had some regrets with choosing Ember.js for my new app. Part of that is my own lack of experience with the framework. But also I&#8217;m no longer convinced that the heavily JavaScript-based view layout of something like Ember.js is better than <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a>, for example. I plan to rewrite my app in Rails and more classic Ajax at the earliest opportunity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2014/09/05/dave_on_javascript_apps">Brent Simmons isn&#8217;t totally convinced</a> about the new crop of JavaScript frameworks:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Part of me thinks those frameworks are overkill (even jQuery), and that writing regular-old JavaScript to do what you want is not that onerous a thing, and will make for leaner, better code.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This was how I felt when I built <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>. It uses jQuery and Bootstrap, but otherwise it&#8217;s pretty old-fashioned JavaScript. Even the parts that are Ajax just fetch and insert HTML that has been rendered by the server. There&#8217;s not much to do in the client.</p>
<p>For my latest project I&#8217;m using <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>. I want this app to be <em>very</em> fast, and I think putting more work on the web browser is the way to do it. I only know the basics of the framework so far, but already I like it. It feels lightweight to use, even if the actual JavaScript include is fairly large.</p>
<p>And 100k is really not that big of a deal anymore. You don&#8217;t want bloat for no reason. But look at a popular site like twitter.com and you&#8217;ll see several JavaScript files between 200k and 500k each. They get cached and no one complains about performance.</p>

		<title>RubyCocoa</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I write Mac software, but over the last year I&#8217;ve increasingly been building Ruby on Rails web apps as well. Today I finally took a look at &#8220;RubyCocoa&#8221;:http://www.rubycocoa.com/. I wanted to whip up a quick Cocoa app that would involve some text parsing, and a dynamic scripting language like Ruby is a much better fit for text processing than C, C++, or Objective-C.</p>
<p>It turns out RubyCocoa works amazingly well. I have only scratched the surface with a small test app, but I was blown away by its ease-of-use, Xcode integration, example projects, and apparent maturity. You have full access to AppKit from Ruby-based controllers and views, and a single NIB file can even reference both Objective-C and Ruby classes. Fantastic stuff.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s ready for commercial software use yet. For distribution, I tested including the RubyCocoa.framework inside the application package and the app launches and runs correctly on a system without the full RubyCocoa install. There may be issues with requiring a recent version of Ruby, but otherwise it&#8217;s a fully native app.</p>
<p>My only disappointment was in the Objective-C calling conventions. There are two versions to choose from: a style using underscores to separate named values, and a slightly easier Ruby syntax using symbols and extra parameters. Here they are:</p>
<p><em>Objective-C:</em></p>
<p><code>[my_window setFrame:r display:YES animate:YES]</code></p>
<p><em>Ruby Underscores:</em></p>
<p><code>my_window.setFrame_display_animate(r, true, true)</code></p>
<p><em>Ruby Symbols:</em></p>
<p><code>my_window.setFrame(r, :display, true, :animate, true)</code></p>
<p>In my opinion, a better approach would be to take advantage of Ruby&#8217;s trick of allowing the last parameter to be a hash supplied without the curly braces. This feels more readable to me and more closely matches the Objective-C equivalent.</p>
<p><em>Better:</em></p>
<p><code>my_window.setFrame(r, :display => true, :animate => true)</code></p>
<p>In any case, that&#8217;s a minor complaint and doesn&#8217;t take much away from the beauty of writing native Mac apps in Ruby.</p>
