				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been over a week since SXSW Interactive wrapped up, and I can&#8217;t bring myself to post anything interesting about it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I had a great time. But I missed more sessions than usual this year (I&#8217;m trying to ship software here!), skipped half the parties (Traci was sick all weekend), and I didn&#8217;t notice any big themes that unified the conference.</p>
<p>Except Twitter. Which just underscores that it is about the people, and what they are doing, and being inspired.</p>
<p>I had a great time meeting new folks and catching up with old acquaintances: talking independent Mac development with Buzz Andersen and Justin Miller; software pricing with John Gruber; Rails and cities with Jamie Stephens and Sergio Rabiela; bumping into old school Mac web guys Carl de Cordova, Raines Cohen, Bill Christensen, and Wes Felter; co-workers and former co-workers Damon Clinkscales and Ryan Irelan respectively; lunch in a pub as a storm came down with Austinites Ben and Sara Brumfield; seeing my old friend John Brauer from high school who needs to email me (hint!); and finally meeting Shaun Inman and a bunch of other people whose names I can&#8217;t recall at the moment and whose business cards are buried somewhere, but no one is quite sure where.</p>
<p>My only regret is that there were a few people I wanted to say hi to that I literally saw from a distance on the first day of the conference and then <em>never saw again</em>. Maybe they took the wrong escalator and are still trapped in the void of that 3rd floor.</p>
<p>Of all the kajillion SXSW posts that have come through my fresh not-even-a-beta copy of NetNewsWire, I liked &#8220;Peter Merholtz&#8217;s write-up&#8221;:http://www.peterme.com/?p=533 the best:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What I realized, and what I need to do if I return to SXSW, is that in order to enjoy what SXSW Interactive has become (and boy, has it changed since 1999) I have to take a more Zen-like approach, ignoring all the Things I Could Be Doing, and focus on simply getting the most out of whatever I Am Doing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Seeya next year.</p>
