Founders <a href="http://www.damonclinkscales.com/">Damon</a>, Robert Rasmussen, and <a href="http://www.nonewmessages.com/">Rob Jones</a> have done a great job getting the group off the ground and lining up interesting topics.</p>
<p>Last night was our fourth meeting. <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/batate/">Bruce Tate</a> gave a talk on his experience ramping up a Rails team and comparisons to the Java world. As a new experiment on the agenda, afterwards some of us stuck around to hack together a member directory for the web site. I didn&#8217;t actively participate in the coding efforts, but I had a good time meeting new people. As usual, it was all followed by drinks at Hickory Street Bar &amp; Grill, where topics of discussion ranged from refactoring to Perl to C++ windowing toolkits to AppleGuide. You know there&#8217;s some real substance to Rails when it brings together such a diverse group.</p>
<p>Also just announced: the <a href="http://www.austinonrails.org/articles/2006/02/21/austin-on-rails-happy-hour-at-sxsw">Rails Happy Hour at SXSW</a>. Should be fun.</p>
