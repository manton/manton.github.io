				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2014/05/24/what_happened_at_userland">Brent Simmons has another expanded résumé</a> of sorts, following his post about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/05/newsgator_and_sepia.html">working at NewsGator</a>. I love this write-up because it mirrors a lot of the work I was doing, so it brings back a lot of memories. I was actively using Frontier for client work and <a href="http://www.manton.org/archive/idiom/mactivity_presentation/">crazy side projects</a>; one of my co-workers for a time was Mason Hale, who built an early CGI framework for Frontier; and I loosely worked with Dave Winer to help run the frontier-talk mailing list and hack on a potential WebSTAR plug-in for Frontier. (Though I was still a pretty poor C programmer back then. Someone else ended up shipping it.)</p>
<p>Back when the job description “webmaster” still meant something, I worked for the WebEdge conference which brought together the best web developers for the Mac OS. WebEdge hosted <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/09/12/MidnightPlanetoWindows.html">the first meeting of the Macintosh Internet Developer Association</a> (MIDAS), led in part by Dave Winer. And I was always playing with the tools that came out of Userland, from Manilla to Radio Userland. I used Radio to run this blog <a href="http://www.manton.org/2004/03/thank_you.html">until 2004</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the developers from that time have faded away, moved on to other projects away from the public spotlight. But not Brent. He just shipped <a href="http://vesperapp.co/blog/vesper-2-0-and-vesper-sync/">Vesper 2.0</a> and it’s some of his best work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday Dave Winer and Kyle Shank launched <a href="http://littleoutliner.com">Little Outliner</a>, an impressive JavaScript outliner that uses HTML5 local storage.

  “Thanks to the W3C and to Werner Vogels (for persisting in getting the ability to access the root of a domain from an S3 bucket). As a result, we get unlimited scaling with zero investment. Consider this an endorsement for both innovations.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I used Frontier a lot back in the earlier days of the web, so I’m always looking out for what Dave does next. It’ll be fun to see what they build on top of this.</p>
