				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Am I always starting over<br />
In a brand new story?<br />
Am I always back at one<br />
After all I&#8217;ve done?&#8221;<br />
— <a href="https://itun.es/us/5MKtZ?i=860769901">Always Starting Over</a>, from the broadway show If/Then</em></p>
<p>Daniel said on the <a href="http://coreint.org/192">latest Core Intuition</a> that it’s important to celebrate major work milestones, like shipping a new app or quitting a job. I didn’t think I’d be celebrating right away, but as it turned out, my wife met me for lunch on Friday and we had a beer to mark the occasion. She snapped this photo:</p>

<p>Some things just work out. I couldn’t have picked a better t-shirt to wear if I had planned it.</p>
<p>When 5pm came around I made a final comment on Confluence, replied to a couple emails, and then signed out of HipChat. But I didn&#8217;t have time for much reflection. My son and I were busy packing up to head to a campout with Boy Scouts. Then as soon as we arrived back the next day, I turned around again to take my daughter to see <a href="http://idinamenzel.com/">Idina Menzel</a>.</p>
<p>The concert was incredible, somehow including both Wicked&#8217;s &#8220;Defying Gratify&#8221; and Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;Creep&#8221; — and yes, of course Frozen — to make a show with both the occasional explicit lyric <em>and</em>  little kids pulled up from the audience to sing. It was only while driving home from the concert that I had a moment to think what I need to do next. Idina&#8217;s lines from If/Then at the beginning of this post kept coming back to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked a long time on a few things, and they were pretty good, but now it&#8217;s time to start over. I turn 40 in a few months. It&#8217;s time to figure out what the next 10 years of my life should be about.</p>
