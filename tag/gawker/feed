				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 2 years ago I read Peter Thiel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296">Zero to One</a> while traveling. It quickly became one of my favorite business books. I&#8217;ve always thought we should strive to create truly new products, not just better versions of old ideas. I referenced the book in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/08/doubt-with-screenshots.html">one of my blog posts</a> about Snippets.today.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/26/11781406/peter-thiel-admits-bankrolling-hulk-hogan-gawker-lawsuit">the Gawker lawsuit</a> that I bothered to learn more about Thiel. It&#8217;s disappointing enough that anyone I respected was on stage at the Republican National Convention, a 4-day train wreck that I expect years from now the GOP will look back on with embarrassment. Now Thiel&#8217;s giving over $1 million to Trump.</p>
<p><a href="https://marco.org/2016/10/17/shame-on-y-combinator">Marco Arment makes the case</a> for Y Combinator distancing itself from Thiel:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Wrapping reprehensible statements or actions as “political beliefs” doesn’t protect them or exempt their supporters from consequences. Racism is racism. Sexual assault is sexual assault. Labeling reprehensible positions as “political beliefs” is a cowardly, meaningless shield.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we should use the word &#8220;shame&#8221; lightly. It&#8217;s used jokingly too often in our industry; for example, &#8220;shame on you&#8221; for not using my favorite app or listening to my favorite show. But on this serious topic, I agree with the content of Marco&#8217;s post completely.</p>
