				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been blogging here for 13 years. If you take any random post from that first year, the majority of the links to other web sites are broken. The default outcome for any site that isn&#8217;t maintained — including the one you&#8217;re reading right now — is for it to vanish. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">Permanence</a> doesn&#8217;t exist on the web.</p>
<p>We can <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">solve this</a>, but it will take time. For now I think mirroring our writing is a great solution, to guard against domain names expiring and other inevitable failures. But where to mirror to?</p>
<p>Only 2 companies keep coming to mind: WordPress.com and GitHub. I believe both will last for decades, maybe even 100 years, and both embrace the open web in a way that most other centralized web sites do not.</p>
<p>Even though I self-host this weblog on WordPress, I&#8217;ve chosen to mirror to GitHub because of their focus on simple, static publishing via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. It has the best chance of running for a long time without intervention.</p>
<p>I exported all of manton.org with the <a href="http://www.httrack.com/">httrack</a> command-line tool and checked it into GitHub, with a CNAME for <a href="http://mirror.manton.org/">mirror.manton.org</a>. It works perfectly. I still need to automate this process so that it updates regularly, but I&#8217;m very happy to finally have a complete mirror for the first time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a common theme for Dave Winer to write about preserving our writing on the web. <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/08/17/criteriaForFuturesafety.html">Today he outlines some criteria</a> for judging whether a web host will last:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The concern is that the record we&#8217;re creating is fragile and ephemeral, so that to historians of the future, the period of innovation where we moved our intellectual presence from physical to electronic media will be a blank spot, with almost none of it persisting.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think about this in 2 parts. The first is publishing your weblog to your own domain name. This ensures that your writing doesn&#8217;t go away and links don&#8217;t break when your web host goes out of business, because you can copy your content somewhere else and map your domain to that new location.</p>
<p>The second is some kind of host that will last forever. This is an unsolved problem. Hosting fees need to be paid, domain name registrations need to be renewed. It may be too big a leap to ever get there, but we could settle instead for better mirroring of content. I&#8217;d like to have my content mirrored automatically to GitHub Pages, for example, and maybe even Medium.</p>
<p>Imagine the life of a printed book from the early 20th century that has now survived generations. How was this possible? Many copies must have been printed, because some will inevitably be lost or destroyed. And when a library or bookstore is closed, copies of the book must be transferred to a new location.</p>
<p>This all follows naturally with a printed book, but to adopt the same pattern for digital works, we must go out of our way to create a system of mirroring and long-term storage that tries to match what happens in the real world automatically. It&#8217;s a great challenge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately very little has changed on this topic since <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">I wrote about permanence 3 years ago</a>. But we can change that. Open formats and auto-mirroring will be a key part of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/sneak-peek-screenshot.html">my new microblogging platform</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With just 5 days left at my regular job, it&#8217;s time to get serious about wrapping up my work. I have a small change mostly ready and tested locally, but need to push it up to GitHub and finish testing on the dev server. I have a couple open Jira tickets to look at after that.</p>
<p>Over the weekend I spent a lot of time with the Stripe API, trying to improve how I manage user subscriptions. Stripe has some new features since I first started using it. For example, options for sales tax and a quantity field. The latter is convenient if you have something like the ability to pay for multiple hosted web sites in a subscription, rather than deal with adding custom line items on an invoice.</p>
<p>Deadlines are an excellent way to push yourself to actually finish something. So this deadline of Friday is good, in a way, but unlike most of my other deadlines, I can’t miss it and keep working for another week. That finality is a little daunting right now, as I look at the week ahead and everything I want to get done.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Boy Scouts have a saying: <a href="http://www.scouting.org/scoutsource/OutdoorProgram/LeaveNoTrace.aspx">leave no trace</a>. One of its basic principles is that when you pack up your camp site, make sure you clean up all the trash. The place should look even better than when you found it.</p>
<p>It’s not a bad principle to keep in mind when leaving a job, either. Projects should be in a good state. I’ve fallen short in one key aspect of this — a conspicuous lack of unit tests in my web apps — but I&#8217;ve been more successful in other areas, like up to date versions of Rails and pretty comprehensive documentation.</p>
<p>Documentation is also an easy thing to improve at the last minute. Today I’m reviewing some API docs from top to bottom again, making sure that the confusing edge cases for how an app works are well covered. For my job at VitalSource, this means editing in <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a>.</p>
<p>The apps in Atlassian’s main suite that I’m familiar with — Confluence, Jira, and HipChat — have improved in small increments over the years. I makes sense that they would move fairly slowly; the apps are heavily used in larger companies, so a major redesign or feature change would not be well-received by many of their customers. Of those 3 apps, HipChat seems easily the best designed, and I expect having Slack as a competitor will keep them focused and driven to improve the app.</p>
<p>This post isn’t meant as a rant against Confluence, but as I use it’s default markup language or WYSIWYG editor I’m reminded of just how much I enjoy writing in Markdown instead. For my own apps, I’ve experimented with writing documentation in Markdown hosted on GitHub, which gives me easy publishing and version history. Tweet Marker, for example, pulls <a href="https://github.com/manton/tweetmarker/blob/master/documentation/v2.md">a Markdown file</a> from GitHub directly and formats it inside its own web interface for Twitter app developers.</p>
<p>As usual, open formats like simple text files are a great choice for any writing that you want to last. For <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/sneak-peek-screenshot.html">my new microblogging project</a>, I need to repurpose a lot of writing I’ve done on this blog and move it into more formal documentation. I’ll probably use Markdown and GitHub for that as well.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">Core Intuition jobs site</a> is still half off for a few more days. $100 to get your job in front of a bunch of great iOS and Mac developers.</p>
<p>(After a decade on Movable Type, I’m migrating this blog to a new system, so I fell into the trap of not posting much until that process is complete. I’ll have much more to write about this soon.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have big news for Searchpath today. The client-side portion of Searchpath is now officially open source and <a href="https://github.com/manton/searchpath">available on GitHub</a>. While I do think one of the innovations of Searchpath is the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, it’s really the simplicity of setting up Searchpath that makes it work. A single line of JavaScript adds a search box and indexes your site, and the crawling and storage will of course remain private on my servers.</p>
<p>Now that part of the service is on GitHub, customers who wanted to extend the JavaScript can have a clear path for doing that. Not only is it easier to host the JavaScript yourself, but I’m accepting pull requests to integrate your improvements back into the core product for everyone to use. Special thanks to <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a> for already submitting some tweaks.</p>
<p>I’m also very excited to announce a simple themes structure for Searchpath. Because in addition to the JavaScript, the second part of customizing Searchpath is the design. While I document CSS class names you can use to override styles, I wanted to make it even easier to design completely new user interfaces and share them with others.</p>
<p>On GitHub you’ll find a “themes” folder. Any sub-folder here will be routinely synced to the main Seachpath server, where you can access it by adding “theme=folder_name” to the JavaScript include URL. To create your own theme, just add a sub-folder with your own custom theme name and submit a pull request. When the theme is added to Searchpath, all your CSS and images will be hosted by my servers. (The first person to use a specific name will effectively become the owner of it, and I’ll only accept pull requests from that person.)</p>
<p>Want to learn more about Searchpath? You can <a href="http://searchpath.io/">try it out here</a> for free, or sign up for $8/month.</p>
