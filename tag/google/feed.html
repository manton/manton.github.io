				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/accelerated-mobile-pages-from-google.html">When I first wrote about Accelerated Mobile Pages</a>, there wasn&#8217;t a true implementation. Now we see how Google is rolling this out, and it has problems. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/10/21/google-amp">John Gruber</a> uses Ars Technica as an example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  On desktop browsers, these URLs do get redirected to Ars’s website. But on mobile they don’t. Share from one mobile device to another and nobody ever leaves google.com. Why would any website turn their entire mobile audience — a majority share of their total audience, for many sites today — over to Google?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe this is inherent in how AMP works, and we should have predicted it. If Google&#8217;s AMP implementation must run in browsers, will there always be a layer of JavaScript and custom URLs that hide the original web site?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d prefer if Google added AMP support directly to Chrome. While it would be a much more limited rollout, it would feel more natural, with fewer drawbacks for publishers.</p>
<p>Competing news platform Apple News isn&#8217;t problem-free either. The <code>apple.news://</code> shared links also add a redirect, with inconsistent behavior since not all platforms and countries even support Apple News. Apple News is an RSS reader that&#8217;s designed like a closed platform.</p>
<p>I want the web to be faster. Breaking links should not be part of the solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High-profile app rejections aren&#8217;t as common as they once were, so it&#8217;s even more shocking when an entire developer account is banned from the App Store. <a href="https://blog.kapeli.com/apple-removed-dash-from-the-app-store">Dash from Kapeli ran into this</a> after trying to migrate an account:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Today I called them and they confirmed my account migration went through and that everything is okay as far as they can tell. A few hours ago I received a “Notice of Termination” email, saying that my account was terminated due to fraudulent conduct.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2016/10/06/apples_judicial_system">Brent Simmons writes</a> about the lack of transparency and minimal appeal process:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  While this is legal, and within Apple’s rights, it’s not what we’ve come to expect from a moral judicial system. No matter what the context, we expect that the accused see the evidence against them, we expect avenues for appeal to be made available, and we expect proportional penalties.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope this misunderstanding with Dash will be cleared up soon. But issues like this will never completely go away until Apple separates app distribution from curation. As long as there is a centralized, tightly-controlled system for installing iOS apps, mistakes will happen.</p>
<p>Imagine instead if the App Store worked more like the web. Google dominates search, but they can&#8217;t shut down your web site. If you try to game the system, Google can remove you from search and limit your exposure. Likewise, developers should be able to distribute iOS apps with minimal involvement from Apple, yet apps that haven&#8217;t passed formal review won&#8217;t be searchable without a direct link, won&#8217;t ever be featured, and won&#8217;t show up in the top 100 lists.</p>
<p>A more open system for app distribution would cleanly solve several problems with the App Store. Apple would be more free to remove clutter from search results without necessarily purging apps from the store. And there would be a natural temporary consequence for suspected fraudulent behavior: simply demote the app, delisting it from search and featured collections.</p>
<p>Apple should focus on highlighting the best apps within a system that lets the app review team make occasional mistakes. There shouldn&#8217;t be such an easy toggle that wipes out an indie developer&#8217;s business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We posted <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/10/episode-253-great-to-have-an-excuse/">Core Intuition episode 253</a> this morning. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Manton and Daniel discuss Manton&#8217;s experience at the Release Notes conference, talk about the rationale for supporting what might be considered edge-case behaviors in apps, and dig deeper into questions of freemium pricing, reflecting on the Omni Group&#8217;s pertinent announcements. Finally they talk briefly about Google&#8217;s latest announcements and what their competition means to Apple.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Google must be doing something right with their announcements, because yesterday my son told me he wants to get a Pixel when it&#8217;s time to replace his iPhone 5S. And as much as I love our Amazon Echo, I can see Google Home taking off if it&#8217;s well-integrated with existing Google services.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I somehow recorded 4 podcast episodes this week. We just published <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/05/episode-233-actually-i-am-a-little-worried/">episode 233 of Core Intuition</a>, where Daniel Jalkut and I talk about the announcements from Google I/O and compare the latest Swift 3 news to our experience going through previous Apple transitions. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Manton and Daniel react to Google’s I/O keynote, and weigh the threat of Allo to iMessage. They celebrate Apple’s WWDC promotion of 3rd party events, and the increasing speed of App Store reviews. Finally, they reflect on the announced delay in Swift 3’s planned ABI stability, and Daniel’s sudden FUD about embracing Swift.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was a big week for the NBA, too, with the first couple games of the east and west conference finals. On <a href="http://technicalfoul.fm/episode-05-therapy-for-manton/">the latest Technical Foul</a>, Ben Thompson and I recap round 2, especially the Spurs loss in 6 games to the Thunder:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Ben and Manton are back geeking out about the NBA. This week we talk Manton through the Spurs loss, discuss OKC versus the Warriors, and whether the Cavs are good enough.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, I published 2 episodes of my microcast Timetable earlier in the week. <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/05/episode-22-grumpy-about-everything/">Episode 22</a> was about dealing with recent stress — trying to see the bigger picture and focus on the good things. <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/05/episode-23-when-a-product-is-over/">Episode 23</a> was about how to tell when it&#8217;s time to move on from a failed product.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve owned an Amazon Echo <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/amazon-echo.html">since it first shipped</a> and it’s great. I also use Siri and like it, though I use it less often for the kind of random questions I might ask Alexa. But after watching yesterday’s Google I/O keynote, I can’t help but feel that eventually Google is going to be far ahead of Amazon and Apple in this space.</p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/05/18/google-io-2016">Here’s John Gruber</a> writing at Daring Fireball about the keynote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Google is clearly the best at this voice-driven assistant stuff. Pichai claimed that in their own competitive analysis, Google Assistant is “an order of magnitude” ahead of competing assistants (read: Siri and Alexa). That sounds about right.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with a voice assistant is that the better it gets, the more you want it to do. You continue to ask it more complicated questions, pushing at the limits of the assistant’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Only Google has the expertise in web services and the massive amount of data to keep going beyond basic questions. I expect both Siri and Alexa will hit brick walls that Google will get past, especially in conversational queries that let the user drill down below the most popular, superficial facts.</p>
<p>That is, unless Apple can open up Siri. Not just plugging in new trigger keywords like Alexa’s “skills” API (which would be a good start), but maybe a complete way to extend Siri with third-party code that feels seamless to the user. Surfacing voice-enabled apps automatically through natural queries might be on the same scale of app discoverability as we saw when the App Store launched.</p>
<p>As Ben Thompson lays out well <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/googles-go-to-market-gap/">in today’s essay</a>, Google faces a different internet than the open web on which they built their search engine. The default for all these new platforms — from Facebook to Siri to the App Store — is to be closed. There’s a narrow window, right now, for someone to take the lead on creating an open voice assistant standard built on the open web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook continues to roll out their Instant Articles format to more publishers. It’s now available to anyone, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/publishing">with this catch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “You won&#8217;t be able to publish Instant Articles until your RSS feed has been approved.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s just what we need: the worst part of the App Store approval process applied to the web. No thanks.</p>
<p>Google’s competing Accelerated Mobile Pages has problems too, as I mentioned in the last half of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/twitter-and-the-cost-of-links.html">this post about the cost of links</a>. Although unlike Facebook, which wants to trap content behind their own platform, AMP is at least more open and useful to the larger web.</p>
<p>I hate to say it but neither Instant Articles nor AMP are really good enough. I think we need a third standard for super-fast web pages. (Or do we? Maybe the web is okay as-is if we <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">fight page bloat</a>.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/hyperlinks-and-saving-the-web">the health of the open web</a>, Maciej Cegłowski gave a talk on web page bloat at the Web Directions conference, and he put <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">the slides and notes online</a> (via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/01/02/website-obesity-crisis">Daring Fireball</a>). It&#8217;s fun to read and there are many great points, but I want to focus on Accelerated Mobile Pages:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The AMP project is ostentatiously open source, and all kinds of publishers have signed on. Out of an abundance of love for the mobile web, Google has volunteered to run the infrastructure, especially the user tracking parts of it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarcasm aside, I think Google&#8217;s involvement is mostly transparent, and I was hopeful about it when <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/accelerated-mobile-pages-from-google.html">I wrote about this in November</a>. Google wants the web to be fast. A faster web includes more ad impressions and is more competitive with native mobile apps. I don&#8217;t think this disqualifies Google from proposing this project.</p>
<p><a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/12/14/does-amp-counter-an-existential-threat-to-google.html">High Scalability has a long article</a> exploring AMP:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Google needs an open and rich ecosystem of knowledge. If that’s not there then Google search won’t be relevant. Which is Google’s direct self-interest, which is also the same objective of the publisher. Publishers need access to an open ecosystem of distribution. Otherwise they’ll have a harder time building audiences if they have to appeal to closed platforms. Yes, Google is a private company that has business interests, but that philosophy and that core similar objective is something very important when considering Google’s role in AMP.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to give Google the benefit of the doubt on AMP. The alternatives are too focused on specific platforms and so even less available to the rest of the web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/how-it-works/">The project technical overview for AMP</a> has the goals and basic info. In a nutshell, the new format encourages a return to more bare-bones HTML, with some added functionality for common web patterns. On the balance between bloated ad platforms and user experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Embedding an ad or analytics often implies giving up control of what eventually happens to a site because they can typically inject any JavaScript they want into pages. AMP HTML does not allow this. We realize that both ads and analytics are an important element of monetization on the web, and so we need to support them: our goal is to realign monetization with great user experience.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, &#8220;tracking pixels&#8221; are used for analytics. These should be easily skipped by ad blockers, but apps that support AMP will need to use a custom web view anyway, where ad blockers on iOS aren&#8217;t allowed. This may continue to limit the appeal of Safari View Controller.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/googles-got-plan-make-mobile-web-less-slow/">Wired covers the announcement</a> and describes how AMP might be integrated into Twitter and other native apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;One surprise beneficiary of AMP may be Twitter. While it’s not a publisher per se, it’s becoming an increasingly important player in news, most recently with the launch of <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/meet-moments-twitters-new-feature/">its Moments feature</a>, which makes news easier to follow on Twitter by organizing Tweets in a chronological, coherent timeline. Now, Twitter will automatically load any articles that are compatible with AMP as AMP files, meaning they will benefit from the same speed inside the Twitter app.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml">more on GitHub</a>. On the surface this seems like a more open approach than Facebook Instant Articles or maybe even Apple News Format (which is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/Apple_News_Format_Ref/index.html">finally public</a>). That <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/mobile-web/">WordPress is supporting AMP</a> is a good sign.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web">Nilay Patel has an essay</a> framing the issue as a fight between Apple, Google, and Facebook, with the web as a casualty:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;And with iOS 9 and content blockers, what you&#8217;re seeing is Apple&#8217;s attempt to fully drive the knife into Google&#8217;s revenue platform. iOS 9 includes a refined search that auto-suggests content and that can search inside apps, pulling content away from Google and users away from the web, it allows users to block ads, and it offers publishers salvation in the form of Apple News, inside of which Apple will happily display (unblockable!) ads, and even sell them on publishers&#8217; behalf for just a 30 percent cut.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m conflicted on this. I hate ads, and I think good publishers can adapt, but I&#8217;m also concerned that some progress we&#8217;ve made in native apps and user experience could be offset by steps <em>back</em> in open platforms. The health of the open web is more important than any one company, including Apple.</p>
