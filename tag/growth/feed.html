				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We planted some trees in our front yard recently. They take decades to grow, and we are under no illusion that they&#8217;ll provide meaningful shade before our children have families of their own. It&#8217;s easy to say: &#8220;Why should I bother? It will take too long before we can see results.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s like anything &mdash; the sooner you start, the less time you have to wait until that thing is mature.</p>
<p>If you procrastinate forever, just because you won&#8217;t see results anytime soon, you&#8217;ll find yourself looking back 10 years later and wishing <em>if only I had just planted that tree / started that new software project, it would have been done by now</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, don&#8217;t let the weight of potential work stop you from doing the right thing.</p>
