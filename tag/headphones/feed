				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have no problems with USB-C on the new MacBook Pro. It will be a small headache at the beginning, for sure. But because it&#8217;s a standard there&#8217;s no long-term compatibility risk the way there is with removing the 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p>More on that below. First, Marco Arment <a href="https://marco.org/2016/11/02/design-for-the-present">doesn&#8217;t think using USB-C exclusively is very practical</a> in a pro laptop:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  A pro laptop released today should definitely have USB-C ports — <em>mostly</em> USB-C ports, even — but it should also have at least one USB-A port.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/11/02/design-for-the-future">John Gruber responds</a> that Apple&#8217;s strategy is to speed up adoption:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  They design for the future, and in doing so, they bring the future here faster. In the alternate universe where the new MacBook Pros ship with one USB-A port, the transition to ubiquitous USB-C peripherals and cables will happen at least a little slower.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with that. But then he closes with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m not saying Marco is wrong. I’m just saying Apple’s not wrong either. It’s the same trade-off with the iPhone 7 headphone jack.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the same at all. It&#8217;s a convenient narrative to group together both the migration away from USB-A and the one away from 3.5mm headphones. There are important differences, though.</p>
<p>USB-C is a standard that is already used in many devices from different vendors. It will become universal. The immediate replacement for the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7 is the Lightning EarPods which come in the box. Lightning is a proprietary cable that will never be used in non-Apple phones, and in fact is not even used on Macs.</p>
<p>You can argue that more and more people will use Bluetooth headphones, but I doubt they will be as common as wired headphones for many years, and there&#8217;s no guarantee that an all-wireless future will <em>ever</em> arrive. There is a very clear migration from USB-A to USB-C. The move to Lightning headphones and Bluetooth is much more complicated and not directly comparable.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hardest transition for fans of Apple Computer from the 1990s is realizing that Apple <em>no longer needs us to defend the company</em>. If I&#8217;m sometimes critical of Apple, both here and on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re the largest tech company in the world.</p>
<p>I will always hold Apple to a very high standard of excellence. They&#8217;ve earned it. When airline flight attendants tell passengers to turn their <a href="http://pxlnv.com/linklog/galaxy-note-7-faa/">Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones off</a> along with the usual warnings about oxygen masks and life vests, we shrug and laugh because it&#8217;s Samsung. From Apple, we expect higher quality and attention to detail, not shortcuts.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs has been gone for 5 years, but the spirit of building insanely great products is well-rooted at Apple. Apple employees are doing incredible, passionate work.</p>
<p>And yet the company itself hardly resembles the struggling computer maker of 20 years ago. Apple is a giant corporation now. Unlike its employees, who have the best intentions, giant corporations are by default selfish, arrogant, and rarely courageous.</p>
<p>Apple does a lot of good for the world. I doubt there&#8217;s another company even approaching Apple&#8217;s size that <a href="http://www.apple.com/environment/">does as much</a>, from renewable energy to safer materials to workplace diversity. But that good doesn&#8217;t absolve them of criticism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/07/jack_off">John Gruber has an article</a> outlining the 5 (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/07/30/option-6">or 6</a>) most likely options for what headphones Apple should include with the new Lightning-only iPhone. His hope is on wireless:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  My hope is that they ship wireless ear buds. When Apple eliminates ports, they tend to do so in favor of wireless technology. Pushing wireless as the default would solve the problem of listening to audio while charging the device, too.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe. I’m not in any hurry to see a Bluetooth-dominated headphone world, and I&#8217;m not sure Apple Support is either. Wired headphones work every single time you plug them in.</p>
<p>As Gruber points out, wireless headphones are also an upsell opportunity. While cheap Bluetooth headphones can be found, Apple&#8217;s Beats are $100 more expensive for wireless. Seems like this extra cost would unnecessarily eat into their margins.</p>
<p>Of course, I have no idea what Apple will do. I just know what I think they <em>should</em> do.</p>
<p>Apple should include Lightning ear buds in the box, and an adapter for older headphones. I don’t expect they will do this forever — the first year would be enough. But this small gesture of including an adapter would mostly erase the negative reviews and user frustration for Apple’s biggest repeat customers: not me, because I intend to keep my iPhone SE for a while, but for everyone who buys a new iPhone each year.</p>
<p>Removing the 3.5mm headphone jack will be the first time Apple has removed a major feature on the iPhone. They can spin Lightning as an improvement all they want; customers with existing headphones will be annoyed. Including an adapter would minimize the inconvenience at launch, without locking Apple in to any long-term technical compromise.</p>
