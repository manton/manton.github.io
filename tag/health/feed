				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/03/apple-shifts-focuses-from-small-products-to-big-issues/">Dan Moren writes for Six Colors</a> about the structure for the 1-hour Apple event today, of which only about half the time was spent on new products:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;If the Apple-FBI fight isn’t yet about public opinion, it probably will be if the matter ends up going to Congress. So it’s no surprise that Tim Cook is going to use his bully pulpit to push Apple’s track record on the welfare of its customers and the world at large, rather than how many products it’s sold and how much money it’s made.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see this continue at future events. Leave the record sales numbers for the finance call, and instead focus on what good Apple is doing <em>because</em> they are big, not just <em>how</em> they are big. Even though I own some Apple stock, I do not personally care that much about the precise magnitude of iPhone shipments this quarter.</p>
<p>As for the new products, nothing to complain about. Since the $10,000 Apple Watch Edition didn&#8217;t get a $50-dollar price drop like the Apple Watch Sport did, guess I&#8217;ll skip that purchase and get an iPhone SE instead.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/18#healthAndTheWeb">Dave Winer</a>, on his health and the RSS 2.0 flame wars:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I want to keep working, but if the choice is between my health and work, health is going to win. If your body is healthy here&#8217;s a chance for you to learn. Some day it won&#8217;t be. You may ask other people to cut you some slack because of that, as I am now. I believe that offering a kindness comes back in the form of kindness; and that being cruel comes back as cruelty.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Thankfully most of the RSS discussion that I&#8217;ve seen has been constructive, such as <a href="http://www.raelity.org/archives/2002/09/05#rss_flowers">Rael&#8217;s post</a> that provided a good perspective of the RSS 1.0 effort.</p>
