				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;STAPLE! The Independent Media Expo&#8221;:http://www.staple-austin.org/ was last Saturday and it turned out great. The &#8220;animation panel I wrote about last week&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/02/animation_panel.html was a lot of fun and didn&#8217;t seem to suffer too much from my amateur moderating abilities. The projector worked, the films were great, and we filled an hour and a half with questions from the audience. Special thanks to &#8220;Damon&#8221;:http://www.damonclinkscales.com/ for working the lights and providing feedback afterwards.</p>
<p>My only regret is that I didn&#8217;t take a few minutes to snap photos or set up a video camera in the back to capture it. I left my camera in the car the whole day. Luckily other attendees took pictures of the rest of the show. Here are Flickr sets from &#8220;Freddie Avalos&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/freddieavalos/sets/72157594570835464/, &#8220;Toby Craig&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/ithinkican/sets/72157594574373510/, and &#8220;Marianne Ways&#8221;:http://flickr.com/photos/mways/sets/72157594569262131/. <b>Update</b>: Damon &#8220;snapped a picture&#8221;:http://flickr.com/photos/digitalnomad/413875252/in/photostream/ after all!</p>
<p>Sunday night was the &#8220;Animation Show&#8221;:http://www.animationshow.com/ at the Paramount and Don Hertzfeldt answered questions afterwards. His latest film may be my favorite of his yet. I worked with Robert at the Animation Show on cross-promotion between their show and STAPLE!, and they were so great to work with I hope we can join forces again next time.</p>
<p>I came away from the whole weekend inspired. Monday a new idea for an animated short film hit me. I think it&#8217;s time to dust off the animation table again.</p>
