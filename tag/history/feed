				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There was a nice bonus at the end of <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/86">Connected episode 86</a>: an interview with Henry Ford Museum curator Kristen Gallerneaux by Stephen Hackett. On the small number of Apple Is in existence, Kristen said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There are apparently 200 or so sold, and the locations today of about 46 of those 200 are known. What’s really special about ours is that is that’s one of the of the first 50 Apple Is that were ever sold, and out of that batch of the first 50, about nine of that batch are known to work. And ours works; it’s completely unmodified.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The transcript is <a href="http://512pixels.net/2016/04/gallerneaux-apple-i-interview/">also available</a>. If you’re an Overcast user, you can jump to the interview segment <a href="https://overcast.fm/+DJKMiSY7A/1:12:01">at about 70 minutes in</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Hackett loves old Macs. (And iPhones and iPods and Newtons.) His fascination with old Apple hardware and the passion to share it with a larger audience — many of whom weren&#8217;t around for the dark days when Apple was doomed — is one of the things I love most about reading <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/">512 Pixels</a>.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s slowly been expanding into video production with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzXBTOSdtmOz9_VMYffr4g">a channel on YouTube</a>. The latest video covers the iPod Shuffle, the tiny iPod without a screen that Apple still sells. At just $49, it&#8217;s not much more expensive than a long USB-C cable and may be the best bargain in Apple&#8217;s lineup after the $399 iPhone SE. <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2016/3/the-history-of-the-ipod-shuffle">Stephen writes</a> about the original Shuffle:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The first Shuffle was built like a glorified USB thumb drive. This new player was smaller than a pack of chewing gum, and built around the concept of shuffling your music. There was no need for a screen or a true clickwheel. If you wanted to listen to music in order, the switch on the back could be set to continuous playback.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, nostalgia. One of the reasons I blog at all, and have been for 14 years now, isn&#8217;t so much for today&#8217;s audience but tomorrow&#8217;s. Even the most mundane blog posts take on new significance with a few years&#8217; distance. Old technical topics have surprisingly poor representation on today&#8217;s web, as linkrot sets in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to what else Stephen has planned. I know <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/83">from the Connected podcast</a> that lately he has been trying to collect all the different original iMac colors. (Two other podcasts that are worth a listen for an additional trip down memory lane: <a href="http://therecord.co/">The Record</a> and <a href="http://simplebeep.com/">Simple Beep</a>.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://scottknaster.blogspot.com/2015/10/when-steve-jobs-movie-came-calling.html">Scott Knaster blogged about</a> his day advising the crew of the new Steve Jobs movie:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Every room had things taped up on the walls. Giant blown up pictures of the different events they were going to re-create. One entire wall was nothing but <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=old+mac+bomb+boxes&amp;safe=off&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1139&amp;bih=986&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAmoVChMI_Ia0q76ryAIVxn2ICh2mqgvl#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=old+mac+bomb+errors">ancient Mac error messages</a>. Another was photos of buildings where different Apple events happened. One wall had pictures from the Internet of random Apple employees from the &#8217;80s.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple seems intent on downplaying this movie as inaccurate and unfair to Steve, but it&#8217;s not supposed to be a documentary. It&#8217;s promising that they asked Scott Knaster for help getting some of the everyday details right. I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.</p>
