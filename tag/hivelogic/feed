				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Benjamin did something interesting several weeks ago: he took his popular blog Hivelogic, where he&#8217;s been posting since 2001, and rebranded the content under a new domain, &#8220;danbenjamin.com&#8221;:http://danbenjamin.com/. Apparently that was just the kick he needed to &#8220;get even more serious&#8221;:http://twitter.com/danbenjamin/status/1095227235 about blogging, because he&#8217;s been on a roll lately.</p>
<p>A couple of my favorite recent posts over there include &#8220;Apologize&#8221;:http://danbenjamin.com/articles/2008/12/apologize and &#8220;Fake Amazon&#8221;:http://danbenjamin.com/articles/2008/12/fake-amazon. The latter is a must-read that finally puts a name to what may be the beginning of the end of the Amazon we all know and love:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By offering these services, Amazon has created a gigantic marketplace, while simultaneously making even the most obscure or hard-to-find items available to anybody. Just type some text into Amazon search, and you&#8217;ll get results. Lots of results. Too many results, it seems, even for Amazon.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been enjoying the &#8220;Tack Sharp podcast&#8221;:http://tacksharp.tv/, even though I hope to never pay more than $300 for a camera.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Watching from the sidelines as Dan Benjamin prepared his first podcast really made me want to get out &#8220;the microphone&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/194992192/ again. Creating a podcast is a great experience, and I always tell myself I&#8217;ll do them more frequently. There have been a few recent events that I&#8217;ve wanted to capture as podcast episodes, including the experience waiting in line for the Wii, but it just hasn&#8217;t come together.</p>
<p>Enough about me. Go listen to &#8220;The Hivelogic Podcast with Dan Benjamin&#8221;:http://www.hivelogic.com/articles/2007/01/06/podcast_is_here, interviewing &#8220;John Gruber&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/ about the upcoming Macworld announcements. The Macworld keynote is this coming Tuesday at 9am Pacific, but I haven&#8217;t heard word yet on whether it will be streamed live or a delayed rebroadcast.</p>
