<blockquote><p>&#8220;Maybe we should just give up on the term REST, since it&#8217;s become so diluted as to mean nothing more than &#8216;HTTP API that&#8217;s not as hard to use as SOAP&#8217;?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds right. &#8220;Pure REST&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer was never strictly followed, and the advantage to consistent HTTP methods &mdash; being able to abstract parts of the client details away, as with &#8220;ActiveResource&#8221;:http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveResource/Base.html &mdash; don&#8217;t seem like significant savings to me. Now that XML-RPC and SOAP are mostly dead, we assume that new APIs are going to be usable from any language without much effort. I won&#8217;t object to having one less acronym in the world.</p>
