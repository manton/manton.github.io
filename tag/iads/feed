				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was looking for a different old post in my archives, and stumbled on this one: <a href="http://www.manton.org/2010/09/i_hope_iad.html">&#8220;I hope iAd fails&#8221;</a>, which I wrote 5 years ago this month. One of my points was that we had a healthy marketplace in the App Store for normal people to actually pay for apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Do we really want to give that marketplace up? Because once it’s gone, and iAds are the norm, it will be an uphill battle to get anyone to pay for anything.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Fast-forward 5 years to today, and well, we&#8217;re on that hill right now. Except there&#8217;s a landslide and I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s going to get buried.</p>
<p>On the <a href="http://www.relay.fm/upgrade/55">Upgrade podcast</a>, Jason Snell and Myke Hurley talked about whether iOS 9&#8217;s Apple News was relevant: what problems is it solving, if any, and — because it will feature unblockable ads powered by iAd — how does it fit into the larger issue of blocking web ads and closed platforms? The discussion starts about <a href="https://overcast.fm/+DeCmyFudI/1:02:18">an hour in</a>.</p>
<p>(If you&#8217;ve used Apple News already, you may not have even seen any ads yet. But Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/">page on Apple News Format</a> makes it clear that they will be encouraging iAd for publishers: &#8220;Monetization is made simple with iAd&#8221;.)</p>
<p>I stand by the opinion that iAd is a mistaken strategy. Apple, if you&#8217;re serious about <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web">this fight with Google</a>, go all-in on the fight and abandon iAd. It seems hypocritical to attack web ads while rolling out your own news platform with ads that can&#8217;t be blocked.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I feel bad admitting it, because some of my friends are betting on iAd revenue to feed their family, but I&#8217;m just not on board with Apple running an advertising network. I don&#8217;t want to see ads in my apps, and I don&#8217;t want Apple to ever lose even a little of what it means to be a product-driven company.</p>
<p>We talk about this on Core Intuition. Nearly every chance I get I like to point out that all these free Google apps come at a cost. <a href="http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/1317967543">Take this tweet</a> from last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Google Voice is so awesome but I just think it&#8217;s dangerous to give Google this much power. Slippery slope, folks. You are not a customer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.metafilter.com/95152/Userdriven-discontent#3256046">And this comment</a> on MetaFilter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you are not paying for it, you&#8217;re not the customer; you&#8217;re the product being sold.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some apps should absolutely be ad-suported (such as a search engine or social network), and many can be freemium (free versions supported by higher-priced subscriptions), but when given a choice I&#8217;d rather pay a fair price for a good service. When your customers are not your users, the product will suffer.</p>
<p>I know the world is full of ads already. We&#8217;re used to it &mdash; numb to it, maybe. But think about what the App Store has done: millions of people are paying real money for apps that complement ad-supported web sites. These same people would never pay a subscription fee to use the web site, but they&#8217;ll pay a few bucks for the same features in an iPhone app <em>and it seems perfectly normal</em>.</p>
<p>Do we really want to give that marketplace up? Because once it&#8217;s gone, and iAds are the norm, it will be an uphill battle to get anyone to pay for anything.</p>
