				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stephen Hackett loves old Macs. (And iPhones and iPods and Newtons.) His fascination with old Apple hardware and the passion to share it with a larger audience — many of whom weren&#8217;t around for the dark days when Apple was doomed — is one of the things I love most about reading <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/">512 Pixels</a>.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s slowly been expanding into video production with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZzXBTOSdtmOz9_VMYffr4g">a channel on YouTube</a>. The latest video covers the iPod Shuffle, the tiny iPod without a screen that Apple still sells. At just $49, it&#8217;s not much more expensive than a long USB-C cable and may be the best bargain in Apple&#8217;s lineup after the $399 iPhone SE. <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2016/3/the-history-of-the-ipod-shuffle">Stephen writes</a> about the original Shuffle:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The first Shuffle was built like a glorified USB thumb drive. This new player was smaller than a pack of chewing gum, and built around the concept of shuffling your music. There was no need for a screen or a true clickwheel. If you wanted to listen to music in order, the switch on the back could be set to continuous playback.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, nostalgia. One of the reasons I blog at all, and have been for 14 years now, isn&#8217;t so much for today&#8217;s audience but tomorrow&#8217;s. Even the most mundane blog posts take on new significance with a few years&#8217; distance. Old technical topics have surprisingly poor representation on today&#8217;s web, as linkrot sets in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to what else Stephen has planned. I know <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected/83">from the Connected podcast</a> that lately he has been trying to collect all the different original iMac colors. (Two other podcasts that are worth a listen for an additional trip down memory lane: <a href="http://therecord.co/">The Record</a> and <a href="http://simplebeep.com/">Simple Beep</a>.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the most recent <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">Six Colors subscriber</a> magazine, Jason Snell talks about adding an SSD to his Mac Mini home server. It got me thinking about finally upgrading our old family iMac (late 2009!) to give it a little more life, so I ordered a new SSD for it today.</p>
<p>A side note about email newsletters: I subscribe to several, and while I love reading them, I can&#8217;t help but think that this great content should be on the web instead. Perhaps a copy of the newsletter text could be subscriber-only on the web just for the first 3-4 months after it has been published, and then open up to everyone. <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/12/newsletters/">Ben Brooks has some more thoughts</a> from the skeptical side of the newsletter debate.</p>
<p>Back to the iMac. The new SSD cost more than I was expecting ($200 + $50 tools), so I think it will serve mostly as a fun exercise in taking apart computers with my son rather than a great upgrade value. A brand new Mac Mini is still only $500, for example. But because nearly everyone in the family already has their own MacBook, or wants one, doesn&#8217;t seem practical to buy a new shared desktop computer.</p>
