				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Serenity Caldwell has a fantastic, hand-drawn <a href="http://www.imore.com/review-apple-pencil-drawn-review-apple-pencil">review of the Apple Pencil for iMore</a>. It reminds me of Scott McCloud. (I blogged about his book Understanding Comics <a href="http://www.manton.org/2003/01/understanding_comics.html">about 13 years ago</a>.)</p>
<p>I’d actually love to see this graphic review style used for other products too. It nicely balances against the trend of long written reviews. Both could have their place.</p>
<p>As for Serenity’s conclusions, I think you’ll hear widespread agreement from artists: the Apple Pencil is significantly better than any other stylus. The palm-rejection alone is reason to get one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/ios-7-vs-instagram-vs-google-vs-twitter-black-white-photo-filter-comparison">Rene Ritchie has a nice comparison of black and white filters</a> in iOS 7 and third-party apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “To create the comparison, I took the screenshots posted on Apple.com, isolated the unfiltered image, loaded it into the other apps, applied their filters, and then took screenshots of the resulting images.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on an iOS 7 app that&#8217;s partly <em>about</em> photos, though not actually a camera app, and I always thought it&#8217;d benefit from a single great black and white filter. Not as one of a dozen filters, but as the only filter in the app — something strikingly different that would be noticed. iOS 7&#8217;s built-in filters and apps like <a href="http://www.pacifichelm.com/cameranoir/">Camera Noir</a> have made me reconsider. Why reinvent the wheel when so much good work is being done on filters by other developers?</p>
