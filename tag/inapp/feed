<blockquote><p>&#8220;But with this 30% thing, the 30% I&#8217;m really interested in is, will Apple eventually see 30% of its revenue come from various cuts, percentages, deals, and obligations? If so, that means a different focus for the company &mdash; a focus on things and people farther removed from me and you. And that makes me a bit bummed out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, neither of us is filling in for Steve Jobs, and Apple <em>can</em> do anything they want within the law. But what Neven captures so well here is that many of us hold Apple to a higher standard because Apple has a history of creating great things. This 30% business model doesn&#8217;t seem to have any place in that history.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the recent release of &#8220;The Daily&#8221;:http://www.thedaily.com/ and the news of &#8220;Sony&#8217;s e-book app rejection&#8221;:http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/02/change-in-apple-policy-has-e-book-fans-worried-about-their-apps.ars, there&#8217;s speculation that Apple will change the rules around iOS in-app purchases. The 30% cut makes it difficult for some businesses to move to the App Store without passing a cost increase on to customers.</p>
<p>Other than &#8220;no change&#8221;, I&#8217;ve only heard two possible solutions:</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Special deals for the big guys.</em> Amazon and other retailers could negotiate lower rates. But as Marco mentioned on &#8220;Build and Analyze&#8221;:http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/11, the App Store treats large and small developers as equals. It&#8217;s a real strength that a 2-person game company can compete with Electronic Arts. I hope we never lose that.</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Lower percentage for everyone.</em> Not going to happen. Take an app like Twitterrific. I consider it a $5 app, but to the store it&#8217;s actually a free app with a $5 in-app upgrade. Lowering the in-app cut would encourage many previously paid apps to convert to free and pay less to Apple.</p>
<p>This is why I believe the only option is for Apple to <em>distinguish between in-app content and features</em>. Content purchases, such as e-books or virtual game items, would be in one class of payment. Feature upgrades, such as unlocking core functionality in the app, would continue to be 30%, same as paid downloads.</p>
<p>Is it confusing for developers? Is it totally subjective and up to the judgement of the review team? Yes. Welcome to the App Store.</p>
