				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jason Snell closed <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2016/06/app-store-uncertainty/">his first take on App Store subscriptions</a> with a question about iPhone app maintenance vs. web services maintenance:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Whether Apple would actually reject a subscription-based app that doesn’t offer any functionality outside of itself, I don’t know. It sure wouldn’t be the first time there was a baffling App Store rejection. But does Apple really want to take the position that ongoing maintenance of a web service has value, but ongoing maintenance and development of an app does not? I don’t think it does.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I wrote about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/06/core-intuition-236-and-app-subscriptions.html">in my post yesterday</a>, users can more easily see the hosting costs for a web service. They&#8217;ve been trained by a decade of paying for web subscriptions. Maintenance for the app itself has some differences.</p>
<p>Think about how costs scale if an app becomes popular. A web service becomes expensive to run, often thousands of dollars each month. You could say that a developer&#8217;s time for app maintenance is <em>also</em> thousands of dollars, but it&#8217;s essentially fixed. Outside of customer support costs, the incremental cost to a developer for an app doesn&#8217;t increase in the same way it does for scaling a backend service.</p>
<p>I hate that Apple has the power to reject our business model for a potential app. I&#8217;m now leaning more to the idea that Apple should approve nearly everything and let customers decide on the value. But there <em>is</em> a difference between maintenance of an app vs. a web service, and the services that are clearly appropriate for subscriptions will be the most successful apps using this new model.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We published <a href="http://coreint.org/236">Core Intuition episode 236</a> today, discussing the recent App Store announcements and a listener question about offices. We wrap up with plans for WWDC.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of great blog posts and podcast episodes already on the App Store subscription change. I listened to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/31">Under the Radar 31</a> and the <a href="https://releasenotes.tv/special-episode-mostly-neutral-ish/">Release Notes special edition</a> today and recommend both. The most confusion seems to be around what kind of apps are appropriate for subscriptions, where by “appropriate” I mean “what Apple will approve”.</p>
<p>John Gruber also <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/06/app_store_subscription_uncertainty">follows up at Daring Fireball</a> on this question:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Professional apps that require “a lot of maintenance of new features and versions” don’t fit either of those categories. <em>Would</em> Twitter clients like Tweetbot and Twitterrific qualify for subscription pricing? After talking to Schiller yesterday, I thought so. Now, I don’t know.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I mention on Core Intuition, apps that have a backend service with obvious hosting and maintenance costs — a music streaming service, an invoicing web app, or a blogging platform, for example — are easier for users to understand as needing to be subscriptions. Twitter apps are an interesting example because <em>some</em> are pure clients to Twitter’s backend, but many increasingly have their own app-specific services like timeline syncing or push notifications.</p>
<p>For years Apple has allowed apps to use auto-renewing subscriptions. I had an iPhone app and companion web service that was approved by Apple for auto-renewing subscriptions, after I made the case for the service as a “cloud” archive. From section 11.15 of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">App Store review guidelines</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Apps may only use auto-renewing subscriptions for periodicals (newspapers, magazines), business Apps (enterprise, productivity, professional creative, cloud storage), and media Apps (video, audio, voice), or the App will be rejected
</p></blockquote>
<p>From my experience and listening to other developers, I’ve had the impression for a while that Apple would essentially reject most auto-renewing app submissions by default. While we still don’t know what “all categories” means in the new announcement, I expect it means that there will no longer be a kind of blanket rejection. Apple will still reject many apps as poorly suited for subscriptions, though, and maybe that&#8217;s okay for now.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m conflicted on this point. John Gruber&#8217;s suggestion to approve everything and let the market decide is compelling and fits better with my instinct that the control should be in developers&#8217; hands.)</p>
<p>“Subscription fatigue” is a real thing that I’ll occasionally hear from customers about. No one wants to pay $1/month to 40 different apps and services; it feels like a burden in a way that paying the same total price to just two apps at $20/month does not. Nevertheless, subscriptions are very powerful. Everything I’ve done over the last few years is to position myself to eventually have a recurring-revenue success.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;But with this 30% thing, the 30% I&#8217;m really interested in is, will Apple eventually see 30% of its revenue come from various cuts, percentages, deals, and obligations? If so, that means a different focus for the company &mdash; a focus on things and people farther removed from me and you. And that makes me a bit bummed out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, neither of us is filling in for Steve Jobs, and Apple <em>can</em> do anything they want within the law. But what Neven captures so well here is that many of us hold Apple to a higher standard because Apple has a history of creating great things. This 30% business model doesn&#8217;t seem to have any place in that history.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the recent release of &#8220;The Daily&#8221;:http://www.thedaily.com/ and the news of &#8220;Sony&#8217;s e-book app rejection&#8221;:http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/02/change-in-apple-policy-has-e-book-fans-worried-about-their-apps.ars, there&#8217;s speculation that Apple will change the rules around iOS in-app purchases. The 30% cut makes it difficult for some businesses to move to the App Store without passing a cost increase on to customers.</p>
<p>Other than &#8220;no change&#8221;, I&#8217;ve only heard two possible solutions:</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Special deals for the big guys.</em> Amazon and other retailers could negotiate lower rates. But as Marco mentioned on &#8220;Build and Analyze&#8221;:http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/11, the App Store treats large and small developers as equals. It&#8217;s a real strength that a 2-person game company can compete with Electronic Arts. I hope we never lose that.</p>
<p>&bull; <em>Lower percentage for everyone.</em> Not going to happen. Take an app like Twitterrific. I consider it a $5 app, but to the store it&#8217;s actually a free app with a $5 in-app upgrade. Lowering the in-app cut would encourage many previously paid apps to convert to free and pay less to Apple.</p>
<p>This is why I believe the only option is for Apple to <em>distinguish between in-app content and features</em>. Content purchases, such as e-books or virtual game items, would be in one class of payment. Feature upgrades, such as unlocking core functionality in the app, would continue to be 30%, same as paid downloads.</p>
<p>Is it confusing for developers? Is it totally subjective and up to the judgement of the review team? Yes. Welcome to the App Store.</p>
