				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw the Al Gore documentary &#8220;An Inconvenient Truth&#8221;:http://www.climatecrisis.net/ last month. It&#8217;s a very important movie, and I hope everyone has a chance to see it.</p>
<p>They handed out copies of Seed Magazine at SXSW this year. There were a few articles on global warming, including &#8220;this depressing quote from James Lovelock&#8221;:http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/05/doomsday_scenarios.php, the environmental scientist responsible for the Gaia hypothesis:</p>
<p>bq. &#8220;The prospects for the coming century are pretty grim: If these predictions are correct, it means that all of the efforts that have been made, like the Kyoto and Montreal agreements, are almost certainly a waste of time. They should have been done 50 or 100 years ago. It&#8217;s too late now to turn back the clock, so to speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>What are we supposed to do with that? If we are scared and powerless, nothing will change.</p>
<p>The Bush administration agenda too is based on fear. Fear led us to IRAQ, to no-warrant wiretapping. Instead, with An Inconvenient Truth you leave the movie theater inspired, with a new sense of urgency. This is beautifully woven together &#8212; personal highlights from Gore&#8217;s life with his talk with facts with videos.</p>
<p>And as a Mac user, it&#8217;s nice to see &#8220;Keynote played such an important part&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/hotnews/articles/2006/05/inconvenienttruth/ in the production of his talks (via &#8220;James Duncan Davidson&#8221;:http://www.duncandavidson.com/).</p>
<p>Also, this on YouTube: &#8220;A Terrifying Message from Al Gore&#8221;:http://youtube.com/watch?v=5BjrOi4vF24 (Futurama!)</p>
