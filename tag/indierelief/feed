<p>I&#8217;m happy to announce that Riverfold is participating. Since my wife and I already gave to the Red Cross, I decided to donate my sales to &#8220;Save the Children&#8221;:http://www.savethechildren.net/, an international organization working in Haiti now. It&#8217;s amazing how many Mac and iPhone developers have come together for Indie Relief, and great that we are able to do something that reaches more charities and has a bigger impact than if we were all just making individual contributions.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;ve been on the fence about whether you need Wii Transfer or Clipstart, &#8220;buy a copy today&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/. Thanks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally took the time to give &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ some much-needed attention, releasing version 2.7 of the application tonight. It&#8217;s got the usual bug fixes and some small visual improvements, but the most important change is better video streaming. The biggest mistake I ever made with Wii Transfer was to buy an Apple TV instead of forcing myself to use my own application.</p>
<p>For this release, I sat down with Wii Transfer and a ripped copy of Star Trek, and I just watched it over and over, experimenting with different Flash Video conversion settings and tweaking networking code. I wasn&#8217;t going to release this until I could watch a 2-hour movie without any rebuffering. The quality is never going to be as good as a console or set-top box with dedicated video streaming features &mdash; this is Flash on the Wii we are talking about &mdash; but I&#8217;m happy with what I came up with.</p>
<p>Wii Transfer is still only $19, and version 2.7 is a free upgrade for any customer who ever bought the application going back to 1.0 over three years ago. Also an important reminder: <em>all sales go to charity starting tomorrow, January 20th</em>, as part of &#8220;Indie Relief&#8221;:http://www.indierelief.com/.</p>
