				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">written about IPFS</a> before, but <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid</a> (from Tim Berners-Lee himself, among other MIT folks) is another new proposal for a more distributed web. I wasn’t familiar with it until reading <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/ways-to-decentralize-the-web/">this article at Digital Trends</a>, which first makes the case for independent content vs. the big centralized platforms:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now a handful of companies own vast swaths of web activity – Facebook for social networking, Google for searching, eBay for auctions – and quite literally own the data their users have provided and generated. This gives these companies unprecedented power over us, and gives them such a competitive advantage that it’s pretty silly to think you’re going to start up a business that’s going to beat them at their own game.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The article continues with the types of data you might share in a Solid application:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  For example, you might keep your personal information in one or several pods: the sort of data about yourself that you put into your Facebook profile; a list of your friends, family, and colleagues; your banking information; maps of where you’ve traveled; some health information. That way if someone built a new social networking application—perhaps to compete head-on with Facebook, or, more likely, to offer specialized services to people with shared interests—you could join by giving it permission to access the appropriate information in your pod.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the showcase applications is called Client-Integrated Micro-Blogging Architecture, surely named mostly for its pronounceable acronym. From the <a href="https://github.com/linkeddata/cimba">CIMBA project site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  CIMBA is a privacy-friendly, decentralized microblogging application that runs in your browser. It is built using the latest HTML5 technologies and Web standards. With CIMBA, people get a microblogging app that behaves like Twitter, built entirely out of parts they can control.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Solid and CIMBA are built on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a>, which in turn is based off of RDF. I’m admittedly biased against RDF, because it often brings with it an immediate sense of over-engineering — too abstracted, solving too many problems at once. I’m glad to see this activity around a distributed web, and I’ll be following Solid, but I also continue to believe that the simple microformats and APIs from the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWebCamp</a> are the best place to start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dave Winer wants <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/22/1400.html">an open alternative to Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I want it to be friendly to Twitter, because as a user and a shareholder, and a developer who uses their platform, I want to see it thrive. But I also strongly believe we need the open system, the <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/06/18/1324.html">Central Park</a> to Twitter&#8217;s condo buildings on Fifth Ave and Central Park West.
</p></blockquote>
<p>John Biesnecker, reading Dave&#8217;s post, <a href="https://gist.github.com/biesnecker/d585c1ba395ffa5c8148128372aa8e2e">suggested XMPP</a> because it&#8217;s an open standard and federated. But as great as XMPP is for messaging, it seems too different from the web; it would be like starting over. The nice thing about building on independent microblogs is that we can leverage the existing open web infrastructure: all the WordPress installs, RSS feeds, and new work from the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWebCamp</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve tried to do for <a href="http://snippets.today/">Snippets.today</a>. Learn from the UI innovations of Twitter — the fast timeline experience, the effortless posting — but without skipping the important first step of independent web publishing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s new activity at the W3C around independent blogging, with new proposals recently posted as working drafts. Helped by a push from the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/">IndieWebCamp</a>, two of the highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-micropub-20160128/">Micropub</a>: Simple format for adding content to your site from native apps.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/">Webmention</a>: Modern replacement for Pingback/Trackback, for handling cross-site replies.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to support these in my new web app. At launch, I hope to allow Micropub POSTs alongside the classic XML-RPC Blogger API (and my own native JSON API).</p>
<p>And of course the IndieWebCamp is also known for <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE</a>: publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere. That strategy has helped me refine <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/fine-heres-a-twitter-feed.html">my own cross-posting</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t think it’s my imagination that <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/tim-cook-swift-and-the-return-of-blogs.html">more and more</a> people are blogging again. Now’s the time to resume your blog, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/04/how-to-start-a-microblog.html">start a microblog</a>, and take back the future of the web <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/07/0801.html">from silos</a>. If we can roll some of these new standards into what we’re building and writing about, the open web will be on the right track.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever someone says &#8220;I don&#8217;t read RSS&#8221;, I actually hear &#8220;I don&#8217;t read Manton&#8217;s blog&#8221;. I could give plenty of reasons why they&#8217;re missing out by ignoring RSS — it&#8217;s still the best way to keep up with bloggers you like who aren&#8217;t linked or retweeted often enough to bubble up on Twitter — but some people won&#8217;t be convinced.</p>
<p>Over three years ago I stopped posting to Twitter. I know it was the right move on principle because there was a real cost in exposure, with fewer people actively keeping up with what I&#8217;ve been working on. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/05/core_intuition_136.html">As I&#8217;ve said before</a>: it wouldn’t mean anything if it didn’t cost me anything.</p>
<p>And yet, many people get their news from Twitter. Since I started <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">microblogging on my own site</a>, I&#8217;ve had time to reflect on the role of indie microblogging and cross-posting. I think the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">IndieWebCamp has it right</a>: publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere. I wrote more back in July <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/embrace-cross-posting.html">about cross-posting</a>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, as I work on a microblog publishing platform of my own, how can I develop a solid cross-posting feature if I don&#8217;t actively use it myself? <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">I&#8217;ve recommended IFTTT</a> to beta testers, but only by using it myself can I know where the gaps in functionality are.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been experimenting. All of my posts now go out to the Twitter account @manton2. This was an account I created 6 years ago for testing. Except for a few of the first tweets, I&#8217;ve cleared out the test content and given it a new life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting some advantages and disadvantages to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can write at my domain name and own my content, but have it automatically sent to Twitter for folks who are there. Unlike how I&#8217;ve been treating these cross-posts to App.net, I&#8217;m not sure whether I will stay engaged and answer replies on Twitter. We&#8217;ll see.</li>
<li>Most of my microblog posts are around 200 characters. These will get truncated on Twitter, with a link back to my site. Full essays get a nicer title and link. I&#8217;ll continue to improve this.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m effectively starting over with zero followers, compared to the 5000 followers I left @manton with. I have no plans to resume using my original account, though. Think of the &#8220;2&#8221; in @manton2 as a reminder that this is a mirror of my posts, and an imperfect one.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can follow <a href="http://twitter.com/manton2">@manton2 on Twitter</a>. Thanks for reading.</p>
