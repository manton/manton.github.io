				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/instagram-hits-400-million-users/">From Graham Spencer</a> at MacStories, commenting on the latest Instagram numbers and that the service is only 5 years old:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;But I was really surprised to remember that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/facebook-to-acquire-instagram-for-1-billion/">Facebook acquired Instagram in April 2012</a>, when Instagram had &#8216;only&#8217; 40 million users. If I recall correctly, a lot of people thought Facebook was crazy to buy Instagram for $1 billion. Well, I think Facebook got the last laugh on that one, and as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2015/09/22/instagram-hits-400-million-users-soaring-past-twitter/">Forbes points out</a>, Instagram now has more monthly active users than Twitter (316 million).&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Impressive growth, but it fits. Instagram has crafted a user experience that encourages thoughtful posts and never feels overwhelming in the way a Twitter or Facebook timeline can be. If Instagram was a paid product, I bet Instagram&#8217;s <a href="https://baremetrics.com/academy/saas-churn">churn rate</a> would be the lowest of any of the big social networks. They did it with a small team and weren&#8217;t afraid to grow slowly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we shipped version 1.1 of <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a>, our app for collecting photos and text together to make and publish stories. Some of the bigger changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instagram and Flickr import.</strong> You can now add any of your own Instagram or Flickr photos into a story. With Flickr, you can even browse from your Flickr sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Dropbox support.</strong> The first version of Sunlit assumed most of your photos on Dropbox were in the Camera Uploads or Photos folder. For 1.1, we’ve added a full Dropbox browser so you can pick any folder you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-user text syncing.</strong> Now anyone subscribed to a story can add both photos and text descriptions, and the text will sync to all users. This is a really powerful feature for collaborating on stories. We think it puts Sunlit in a class above any other app like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confirm deleted photos.</strong> What happens if you let other people add photos to your story, but they accidentally delete one of your photos? Sunlit now tracks this and shows a special confirmation alert so that you can either allow the photo to be deleted or keep it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other fixes and improvements too, which you can <a href="http://sunlit.io/releasenotes">see in the release notes</a>. Here are a few screenshots of the new Dropbox and Flickr screens:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2014/sunlit_dropbox_flickr.png" width="600" height="336" alt="Sunlit v1.1" /></p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/sunlit/id690924901?mt=8">Sunlit is available in the App store</a> as a free download. If you like it, pay just $4.99 to unlock the full app, and leave a review in the App Store to help others discover the app. Thanks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.imore.com/ios-7-vs-instagram-vs-google-vs-twitter-black-white-photo-filter-comparison">Rene Ritchie has a nice comparison of black and white filters</a> in iOS 7 and third-party apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “To create the comparison, I took the screenshots posted on Apple.com, isolated the unfiltered image, loaded it into the other apps, applied their filters, and then took screenshots of the resulting images.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on an iOS 7 app that&#8217;s partly <em>about</em> photos, though not actually a camera app, and I always thought it&#8217;d benefit from a single great black and white filter. Not as one of a dozen filters, but as the only filter in the app — something strikingly different that would be noticed. iOS 7&#8217;s built-in filters and apps like <a href="http://www.pacifichelm.com/cameranoir/">Camera Noir</a> have made me reconsider. Why reinvent the wheel when so much good work is being done on filters by other developers?</p>
<p>Related, the <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/12/09/how_i_instagram.html">excellent mobile photo workflow by Rands</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has been some good commentary on &#8220;Sergey Brin&#8217;s interview&#8221;:http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/15/web-freedom-threat-google-brin with the Guardian. It&#8217;s probably best summarized in &#8220;John Gruber&#8217;s comment&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/15/google-open-web:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The assumption here is that the only way to search is through Google, and that the &#8216;open Internet&#8217; is only what Google can index and sell ads against.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This resonates with me because I think Google has put enough ads on the internet. It&#8217;s impossible to take anything Google says at face value if they talk of &#8220;open&#8221; but their intentions say &#8220;ads&#8221;. But here&#8217;s the thing: Brin is actually right. There <em>is</em> great data hidden behind apps that should be indexable.</p>
<p>In the race to win the App Store, we forgot about the web. Think about Instagram. Millions of photos are being shared that are inaccessible via a search engine. These photos can&#8217;t be found again and aren&#8217;t discoverable. When you search the web, how does it make sense that public photos on Flickr show up, but public photos on Instagram do not?</p>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t have to choose between Apple&#8217;s closed systems and Google&#8217;s ad-driven business. I want to talk about improving the web without automatically being pro-Google. &#8220;This tweet from John Marstall&#8221;:https://twitter.com/iconmaster/status/191901693527605248 made me realize it:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;d prefer to separate &#8216;indexable&#8217; from &#8216;indexable by Google.&#8217; Yes, they&#8217;re mostly the same for now. Might not always be.&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>We need competition in web search. More than Bing. A new search engine is the number 1 item from &#8220;Paul Graham&#8217;s frighteningly ambitious ideas&#8221;:http://www.paulgraham.com/ambitious.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The best ideas are just on the right side of impossible. I don&#8217;t know if this one is possible, but there are signs it might be. Making a new search engine means competing with Google, and recently I&#8217;ve noticed some cracks in their fortress.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s crazy, but so was the 1st search breakthrough, lightning-fast AltaVista, and so was the 2nd major innovation, Google itself. It&#8217;s time for a search engine that isn&#8217;t all about ads. It&#8217;s time for search that understands apps and embraces data from web services as much as it does from web sites. It&#8217;s time for the 3rd act in search.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love reading about how big sites use Amazon EC2. If &#8220;this post from Instagram&#8221;:http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances-dozens-of is still accurate, they must be at something like $50k/month in hosting costs. Their user base has doubled in the 4 months since they posted that.</p>
<p>My setup for Tweet Marker is trivial by comparison, but to me &mdash; without Instagram&#8217;s $7 million in funding &mdash; it&#8217;s a very big deal. What I wrote &#8220;back in October&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/10/redisonly_migration.html about moving to Redis is still mostly true, although I&#8217;ve added MySQL and Sphinx to the mix. I now run with 3 Amazon EC2 &#8220;medium&#8221; instances and have 5 web dynos (with 3 Unicorn processes each) at Heroku.</p>
<p>I put everything from donations back into the servers. For Tweet Marker to work, it had to be rock solid. It had to scale. It&#8217;s only the first week for &#8220;Tweet Marker Plus&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/plus subscriptions, but already I have a good feeling that it&#8217;ll all pay off.</p>
