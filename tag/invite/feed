				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time in weeks, we had nothing going on this morning and could sleep in. After a late breakfast I worked on implementing a better trial for my new product, letting the <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/two-weeks-notice-your-business-model-is-wrong.html">business model advice I mentioned yesterday</a> sink in.</p>
<p>Ryan Irelan, who founded <a href="https://mijingo.com/">Mijingo</a> to create books and video courses for developers, <a href="http://ryanirelan.com/2015/07/24/mijingo-mistakes.html">wrote today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;One of my biggest mistakes in my first several months of running Mijingo full-time is that I was going too fast.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I probably needed to hear that. I&#8217;m increasingly worried about launching this new project either half-baked or too late, so I&#8217;ve been trying to ramp up the hours I dedicate to it each week. But I&#8217;m scrambling to quickly change fairly major aspects of it. It may be better to slow down to make sure I still have the bigger picture correct.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be traveling some in August, so that rules out releasing anything brand new before the trip. I&#8217;m thinking my focus leading up to that is to send this to the subscribers of my <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">beta announce list</a> first. Both the free parts and paid plans will be open as if it was a finished product, but it will just be limited to an invite-only group. Based on that feedback I&#8217;ll know how close it really is to shipping for everyone.</p>
