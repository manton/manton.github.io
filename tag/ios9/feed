				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was looking for a different old post in my archives, and stumbled on this one: <a href="http://www.manton.org/2010/09/i_hope_iad.html">&#8220;I hope iAd fails&#8221;</a>, which I wrote 5 years ago this month. One of my points was that we had a healthy marketplace in the App Store for normal people to actually pay for apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Do we really want to give that marketplace up? Because once it’s gone, and iAds are the norm, it will be an uphill battle to get anyone to pay for anything.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Fast-forward 5 years to today, and well, we&#8217;re on that hill right now. Except there&#8217;s a landslide and I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s going to get buried.</p>
<p>On the <a href="http://www.relay.fm/upgrade/55">Upgrade podcast</a>, Jason Snell and Myke Hurley talked about whether iOS 9&#8217;s Apple News was relevant: what problems is it solving, if any, and — because it will feature unblockable ads powered by iAd — how does it fit into the larger issue of blocking web ads and closed platforms? The discussion starts about <a href="https://overcast.fm/+DeCmyFudI/1:02:18">an hour in</a>.</p>
<p>(If you&#8217;ve used Apple News already, you may not have even seen any ads yet. But Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/">page on Apple News Format</a> makes it clear that they will be encouraging iAd for publishers: &#8220;Monetization is made simple with iAd&#8221;.)</p>
<p>I stand by the opinion that iAd is a mistaken strategy. Apple, if you&#8217;re serious about <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web">this fight with Google</a>, go all-in on the fight and abandon iAd. It seems hypocritical to attack web ads while rolling out your own news platform with ads that can&#8217;t be blocked.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard that Marco Arment has pulled his content-blocking app Peace from the App Store. The app was <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/09/18/just-doesnt-feel-good">extremely successful</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;As I write this, Peace has been the number one paid app in the U.S. App Store for about 36 hours. It’s a massive achievement that should be the highlight of my professional career. If <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> even broke the top 100, I’d be over the moon.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen some comments asking why he didn&#8217;t think to do this sooner, before he even shipped the app. But we are just now starting to understand the impact of ad blockers in iOS 9. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an exaggeration to say that the web is different than it was a few days ago, and so our choices — and Marco&#8217;s — are different too. As I mentioned <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/wrap-up-thoughts-on-the-tv-web.html">yesterday</a>, content blockers are one facet of an overall shake-up for the web.</p>
<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2015/09/18/why_we_love_indies">Brent Simmons writes</a> that only indies can do what Marco did. Marco must have left a lot of money on the table with this decision. It will always look like the right call to me when someone goes with their gut feeling and not with profit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven&#8217;t paid too much attention to ad blocking until this week, even though I had been running the iOS 9 beta since WWDC. Several content blockers were released yesterday, like Marco Arment&#8217;s new app <a href="https://peace.land">Peace</a>. Marco writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;You won’t believe how fast browsing the web can be without the bloated, privacy-invading junk that too many publishers force on you <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/08/11/ad-blocking-ethics">without your knowledge or consent</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web">Nilay Patel has an essay</a> framing the issue as a fight between Apple, Google, and Facebook, with the web as a casualty:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;And with iOS 9 and content blockers, what you&#8217;re seeing is Apple&#8217;s attempt to fully drive the knife into Google&#8217;s revenue platform. iOS 9 includes a refined search that auto-suggests content and that can search inside apps, pulling content away from Google and users away from the web, it allows users to block ads, and it offers publishers salvation in the form of Apple News, inside of which Apple will happily display (unblockable!) ads, and even sell them on publishers&#8217; behalf for just a 30 percent cut.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m conflicted on this. I hate ads, and I think good publishers can adapt, but I&#8217;m also concerned that some progress we&#8217;ve made in native apps and user experience could be offset by steps <em>back</em> in open platforms. The health of the open web is more important than any one company, including Apple.</p>
