				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jason Snell has posted <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/ipad-pro-new-tricks-for-old-dogs/">his initial thoughts on using the iPad Pro</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;What the past few days have taught me is that if I needed to switch from Mac to iPad, if I had a compelling reason, I could absolutely do it. I <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/">can edit podcasts</a>, write articles, edit spreadsheets, generate charts and graphs, edit photos, build web sites, transfer files via FTP, and more.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Jason got an Apple Pencil or Smart Keyboard, although maybe he&#8217;ll have one of each in time for his full review. If you&#8217;ve enjoyed reading Six Colors as much as I have over the last year, <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">consider subscribing too</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I ordered my iPad Pro online and picked it up in the store today. My excitement for this device is all about the Pencil, which doesn&#8217;t ship for a few more weeks. The store didn&#8217;t receive any and employees have no idea when they will get it. They didn&#8217;t receive any Apple keyboards either, so I left with the only remaining accessory in stock: the white smart cover.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been less excited to walk out of a store with a brand new $800 gadget. The iPad Pro has <em>so much potential</em>. I think it&#8217;s going to be a success and I&#8217;m building apps for it. But without the Pencil and keyboard, a significant part of the appeal is missing. And worse, developers who need a Pencil to start testing their apps — especially those apps like the one I&#8217;m working on that already supports third-party stylus pressure — are put at a month-long disadvantage compared to Adobe and the other early partners.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading the iPad Pro reviews this morning, especially from <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2015/11/the_ipad_pro">Daring Fireball</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-review/#software-keyboard">MacStories</a>. But those reviews describe a product that just doesn&#8217;t exist today. The iPad Pro as advertised on Apple&#8217;s web site and in beautiful marketing videos isn&#8217;t ready, and I wish Apple had delayed the whole launch until they could deliver these important accessories for a complete user experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> 2.3 shipped last week, and I just submitted an update last night to fix a few crashing bugs and other minor problems with the release. I’m pretty happy with this version. In addition to finally switching to Twitter’s v1.1 API — easier said than done; I used several API calls that were changed or completely went away — this release added better gestures, a month filter to the iPhone version, and an updated UI with a lighter, clearer design.</p>
<p>You can see the <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/releasenotes/">full changes in the release notes</a>, or listen to <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2013/05/episode-88-bundling-a-thousand-features-into-it/">episode 88 of Core Intuition</a>. Daniel and I discussed the expedited review process and new versions. Tweet Library 2.3 is available <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/tweet-library/id365768793?mt=8">in the App Store for $7.99</a> as a universal app for both iPhone and iPad.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shawn Blanc looks back to <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2010/04/diary-of-an-ipad-owner/">a post 3 years ago</a> about his experience buying and using the first iPad. From waiting in line:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “<strong>7:32 am:</strong> A young guy and his mom get in line behind us. The guy is wearing a ‘WWSJD’ t-shirt. I like to think that I’m less nerdy than he is, but the fact is I am <em>ahead of him</em> in line.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I wish I had written so many detailed notes. I did, however, find an old draft blog post with my current list of apps from back then. Here’s what I was running on my first iPad in early April, 2010:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitterrific.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NetNewsWire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instapaper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freeform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sketchbook Pro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OmniGraffle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And free apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>AIM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iBooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kindle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Netflix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New York Times Editors’ Choice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And a couple games, like Flight Control HD.</p>
<p>Of those paid apps, I’m only still routinely using Instapaper today, and — even though I’m not on Twitter — occasionally Twitterrific. NetNewsWire for iPad in particular held up very well; I used it every day for probably 2 years <em>after</em> it had stopped being updated.</p>
<p>Most of the apps that were released for the iPad’s debut were more mature than apps from the iPhone OS 2.0 release and first App Store. By the time the iPad came along, developers seemed to have gotten the hang of the platform.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lots of new people are joining App.net. If you’re one of them, welcome! In this post I’m going to briefly review 3 of the most popular iPhone clients: <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/netbot/">Netbot</a>, <a href="http://tigerbears.com/felix/">Felix</a>, and <a href="http://riposteapp.net/">Riposte</a>. You can’t really go wrong with any of these three apps. And if you’re looking for a Mac client, my current favorite is <a href="http://kiwi-app.net/">Kiwi</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2013/adn_netbot.png" alt="Netbot" border="0" width="180" height="259" style="float:right; padding: 5px;" /></p>
<p><strong>Netbot</strong> is nearly identical to Tweetbot. It shares most of the same source and all of the same UI design. That common heritage is great because it’s familiar to fans of Tweetbot, and it allowed Tapbots to launch onto App.net in a big way, leapfrogging all other clients that were under development at that time.</p>
<p>But the familiar design is a double-edged sword. Not just because the App.net API will evolve and diverge from the Twitter API, but because if you switch between both Tweetbot and Netbot often, you may need to be careful that you remember which app you’re posting from. This was a problem for me since I no longer post to Twitter, and the last thing I wanted to do was accidentally leave a new post there after a 5-month absence.</p>
<p>All the usual features you’d expect are present in Netbot: timeline, mentions, private messages, multiple accounts, and sync with Stream Marker. It even has an iPad version, which you may want to pick up even if you chose a different primary app on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Netbot also has one big feature that most App.net clients don’t have: post search. This is not part of the core App.net API. Tapbots rolled their own search server so that they could offer this feature inside the app.</p>
<p><em>Sidenote plug: if you want search for all the posts from anyone you’re following, and your own posts, consider my web app <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>. You can subscribe on the web or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/watermark-mobile/id566886320?ls=1&amp;mt=8">in the iPhone version</a>.</em></p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2013/adn_felix.png" alt="Felix" border="0" width="180" height="259" style="float:right; padding: 5px;" /></p>
<p><strong>Felix</strong> is possibly the most mature and actively maintained of the App.net-exclusive apps. You can tell <a href="https://alpha.app.net/billkunz">from his App.net posts</a> that the developer is passionate about App.net and determined to keep making his app better.</p>
<p>The current version supports all the basic features as well as push notifications, narrow inline image previews that take the full width of the screen, iCloud sync for drafts, starred conversations, and a brand new feature in version 1.5: collapsing posts you don’t want to see, similar to Twitterrific 5’s muffling. The only omission is that it does not yet support multiple accounts.</p>
<p>Felix is also unique in that it is the only one of these 3 apps that is not free. The other apps are counting on the <a href="http://blog.app.net/2012/09/27/announcing-the-app-net-developer-incentive-program/">Developer Incentive Program</a> to send them a check each month instead of relying on traditional sales. Felix is a good value at $5, though, and the price shouldn’t stop you from trying it out, especially as it is a very small amount compared to the paid App.net subscription itself.</p>
<p>There are a number of gestures in Felix. One interesting shortcut — which may also be familiar to users of Twitterrific 5 — is swipe right to quickly start a reply. I personally found that this breaks the illusion of gestures as direct manipulation, though. Since swiping to the left pulls forward the conversation, doing the reverse swipe should go back to the timeline. (<strong>Update:</strong> There’s actually a setting in Felix to switch this behavior.)</p>
<p>Felix also added a clever trick in its post composition window. You can swipe the text view to move the selection cursor one character over, or use two fingers to swipe across an entire word at a time. This saves a lot of time tapping-and-holding and fiddling with the magnifying glass. Felix is packed with little details and shortcuts like this.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2013/adn_riposte.png" alt="Riposte" border="0" width="180" height="259" style="float:right; padding: 5px;" /></p>
<p><strong>Riposte</strong> is beautifully done, with a clear design and a simple left/right gesture system to navigate through anything in the app. By default, there is no toolbar or tabs; everything is full-screen. Following Netbot’s lead, the developers of Riposte have decided to make their app free, and they have <a href="http://riposteapp.net/why-were-free.html">written up some thoughts on why</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple accounts are handled well and it’s easy to switch between them. Like Felix and Netbot, push notifications are supported. Riposte uses large square inline images. It’s got a great interactions view that shows users who have recently followed you or starred your posts.</p>
<p>Riposte mirrors Felix’s compose text view gestures, and Riposte was the first to introduce 2-finger swipes in that text view. I love that both apps now support these gestures about equally, and hope to see many more apps steal this feature soon.</p>
<p>Since it doesn’t have tabs, switching between timeline, mentions, global stream, and other views is done through a slide-out panel, <a href="http://kenyarmosh.com/ios-pattern-slide-out-navigation/">popularized in early apps</a> like Facebook, Path, and Sparrow, and now very common everywhere, including my own Twitter app <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>. It’s a swipe and a tap instead of the single tap of Netbot or Felix, but it is space-efficient and fits the flow of gestures in Riposte.</p>
<p>While Riposte holds its own against the competition, I think it will be chosen most not for its features but for its design. The striking full-screen look and consistent, discoverable gestures make this app feel great. It also has probably the most readable conversation view of any app I’ve used, where the focused post appears immediately and then is surrounded with the full conversation using smaller text. That design is even maintained in HTML email when sending a conversation from the app.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2012/10/ipad_mini">John Gruber’s iPad Mini review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “If the Mini had a retina display, I’d switch from the iPad 3 in a heartbeat. As it stands, I’m going to switch anyway. Going non-retina is a particularly bitter pill for me, but I like the iPad Mini’s size and weight so much that I’m going to swallow it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I said on <a href="http://coreint.org/64">the last Core Intuition</a>, it’s even more of an easy switch for me since I never upgraded to the iPad 3. The iPad Mini has essentially been my only iPad for the last week. I’m using it more, and taking it places that I would’ve have bothered with before. My new favorite Apple device.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m fascinated with the iPad &#8220;3&#8221; rumors because on the surface they make so little sense. Apple just shipped the iPad 2, no competitors can match it, and demand is strong. Why mess with a good thing so soon?</p>
<p>But it almost fits when <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/07/11/ipad-pro">you give it a name like &#8220;Pro&#8221;</a> (or iPad Retina, or whatever). This isn&#8217;t a replacement for the current iPad; it&#8217;s another layer to the product lineup. And like the awkwardly-named iPod Photo from 2004, I bet the iPad Pro is meant to be temporary. It&#8217;s a way to sell a high-end, over-priced and over-pixeled iPad before the technology is cheap enough for the masses. A year or two from now, the Retina Display will be available in all iPads, and the &#8220;Pro&#8221; name will fade away, just like iPod Photo did when all iPods got a color screen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;David Barnard chimes in&#8221;:http://davidbarnard.com/post/5649151852/orchestrating-magic on The Daily:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The carousel is a fun bit of UI (at least in theory, it&#8217;s still a bit laggy and jittery for my taste), but there&#8217;s just no way to quickly deliver enough content to make the carousel usable. The front page and table of contents, on the other hand, could likely be fully delivered in the 4-5 seconds from the launch of the app to the end of the launch animation. Sending users directly to the front page (or potentially a redesigned table of contents, but I wont get into that) will make it feel as though the app has been magically filled with content.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>David makes some great points. Put another way, if some of their design decisions were too ambitious for their technical plumbing to keep up with, they should update the design and optimize it for speed. With such a mainstream app, though, you can&#8217;t really win. I&#8217;m sure if it was only fast and not fancy, it would have been criticized as too bland.</p>
<p>The initial criticism of &#8220;The Daily&#8221;:http://www.thedaily.com/ always seemed overblown to me. It&#8217;s not perfect, but they got some of the difficult things right: navigation that makes sense, original content, good layout, clear subscription model.</p>
<p>Off and on for the first few weeks, I would read several articles each day in The Daily. There were a couple crashes and glitches, but nothing that made the app unusable. If no one else had been complaining, I&#8217;m not sure I would have noticed anything so wrong it was worth mentioning.</p>
<p>They can make it faster and polish up the rough edges over a few subsequent bug fix releases. And maybe enough of the fundamentals are right that they can get pretty far even without the design changes David suggests.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve &#8220;written a few e-book apps&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/, I can say with certainty that getting the basics right is more challenging than it looks. Other traditional companies moving their content to the iPad have launched much farther off-course than The Daily.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I can, and do, write regularly with my iPad. But, to be perfectly honest, I rarely use it to edit, because I find it kind of clumsy to move the cursor around the screen with my finger. However, the iPad is a marvellous first draft machine.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of my blog posts start life on the iPad too. I write them in Simplenote, sync with the Mac to finish the post if it needs editing, then copy to MarsEdit to publish. It&#8217;s not completely smooth, but it&#8217;s a workflow that wasn&#8217;t even possible a year ago.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about the iPad 2. Yes, &#8220;most of it was expected&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/status/42597189645639680, but faster and more memory is exactly what the iPad needs. I&#8217;ll be getting it on day 1 and can&#8217;t wait to give Tweet Library a try on the new hardware.</p>
<p>During the announcement I collected 70 tweets that I thought captured the event. You can &#8220;view them on tweetlibrary.com&#8221;:http://tweetlibrary.com/manton/ipad2event.</p>
<p>Speaking of Tweet Library, Apple just approved version 1.2.2. It fixes a handful of bugs and adds a few new things, like block and report spam, for those of you using it as your main Twitter client. Check out the &#8220;full release notes&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/releasenotes/ or view it &#8220;in the App Store&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweet-library/id365768793?mt=8.</p>
