				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">written about IPFS</a> before, but <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid</a> (from Tim Berners-Lee himself, among other MIT folks) is another new proposal for a more distributed web. I wasn’t familiar with it until reading <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/ways-to-decentralize-the-web/">this article at Digital Trends</a>, which first makes the case for independent content vs. the big centralized platforms:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now a handful of companies own vast swaths of web activity – Facebook for social networking, Google for searching, eBay for auctions – and quite literally own the data their users have provided and generated. This gives these companies unprecedented power over us, and gives them such a competitive advantage that it’s pretty silly to think you’re going to start up a business that’s going to beat them at their own game.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The article continues with the types of data you might share in a Solid application:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  For example, you might keep your personal information in one or several pods: the sort of data about yourself that you put into your Facebook profile; a list of your friends, family, and colleagues; your banking information; maps of where you’ve traveled; some health information. That way if someone built a new social networking application—perhaps to compete head-on with Facebook, or, more likely, to offer specialized services to people with shared interests—you could join by giving it permission to access the appropriate information in your pod.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the showcase applications is called Client-Integrated Micro-Blogging Architecture, surely named mostly for its pronounceable acronym. From the <a href="https://github.com/linkeddata/cimba">CIMBA project site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  CIMBA is a privacy-friendly, decentralized microblogging application that runs in your browser. It is built using the latest HTML5 technologies and Web standards. With CIMBA, people get a microblogging app that behaves like Twitter, built entirely out of parts they can control.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Solid and CIMBA are built on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a>, which in turn is based off of RDF. I’m admittedly biased against RDF, because it often brings with it an immediate sense of over-engineering — too abstracted, solving too many problems at once. I’m glad to see this activity around a distributed web, and I’ll be following Solid, but I also continue to believe that the simple microformats and APIs from the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWebCamp</a> are the best place to start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/2016/04/05/getting-back-to-view-source-on-the-web-the-movable-web-decentralized-web/">Brewster Kahle has a post at the Internet Archive</a> about getting back to the &#8220;view source&#8221; feature that made early web development so much more accessible than it is today. He thinks it can be achieved on top of a distributed web where all the HTML and JavaScript files are delivered to the browser:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The decentralized web works by having a p2p distribution of the files that make up the website, and then the website runs in your browser. By being completely portable, the website has all the pieces it needs: text, programs, and data. It can all be versioned, archived, and examined.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He mentions IPFS in particular, which <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">I&#8217;ve written about before</a>. The bottom line is that static HTML sites are more portable. They more naturally evolve not just from host to host as necessary, but also to a possible distributed future web. That&#8217;s why that — even though I still use and recommend WordPress — I have a <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/complete-mirror-of-this-blog.html">static mirror of my site too</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2015/09/11/aGoodDayToThinkAboutWebHistory.html">Dave Winer</a> on the continued disappearance of old web sites:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to sound the alarms. Every day we lose more of the history of the web. Every day is an opportunity to act to make sure we don&#8217;t lose more of it. And we should be putting systems into place to be more sure we don&#8217;t lose future history.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://stevenf.com/2015/09/09/http-is-obsolete-its-time-for-the-distributed-permanent-web/">Steven Frank pointed to</a> a new format and protocol called IPFS, which <a href="https://blog.neocities.org/its-time-for-the-permanent-web.html">Neocities is embracing</a>. Copies of your content would live in multiple nodes across the web instead of in a single, centralized location. From their blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Distributing the web would make it less malleable by a small handful of powerful organizations, and that improves both our freedom and our independence. It also reduces the risk of the &#8216;one giant shutdown&#8217; that takes a massive amount of data with it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I took some time to read through what it can do, and I&#8217;d like to support it for the publishing platform that&#8217;s in my new microblogging project. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s technically feasible yet, but I love that someone is trying to solve this. We just have to start somewhere.</p>
