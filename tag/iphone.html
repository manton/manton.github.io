			<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/07/jack_off">John Gruber has an article</a> outlining the 5 (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/07/30/option-6">or 6</a>) most likely options for what headphones Apple should include with the new Lightning-only iPhone. His hope is on wireless:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  My hope is that they ship wireless ear buds. When Apple eliminates ports, they tend to do so in favor of wireless technology. Pushing wireless as the default would solve the problem of listening to audio while charging the device, too.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe. I‚Äôm not in any hurry to see a Bluetooth-dominated headphone world, and I&#8217;m not sure Apple Support is either. Wired headphones work every single time you plug them in.</p>
<p>As Gruber points out, wireless headphones are also an upsell opportunity. While cheap Bluetooth headphones can be found, Apple&#8217;s Beats are $100 more expensive for wireless. Seems like this extra cost would unnecessarily eat into their margins.</p>
<p>Of course, I have no idea what Apple will do. I just know what I think they <em>should</em> do.</p>
<p>Apple should include Lightning ear buds in the box, and an adapter for older headphones. I don‚Äôt expect they will do this forever ‚Äî the first year would be enough. But this small gesture of including an adapter would mostly erase the negative reviews and user frustration for Apple‚Äôs biggest repeat customers: not me, because I intend to keep my iPhone SE for a while, but for everyone who buys a new iPhone each year.</p>
<p>Removing the 3.5mm headphone jack will be the first time Apple has removed a major feature on the iPhone. They can spin Lightning as an improvement all they want; customers with existing headphones will be annoyed. Including an adapter would minimize the inconvenience at launch, without locking Apple in to any long-term technical compromise.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/2016/02/why-slowness-is-killing-the-apple-watch/">Dan Moren wrote an essay for Six Colors last week</a> about why slowness is such a problem for the Apple Watch:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  ‚ÄúThe stale data and the lack of speed means that either you have to stare at your Watch for several seconds and hope the data updates; or tap on the complication to load the Watch app, which as we all know takes a good long while as well; or simply give up and pull out your phone. [&#8230;] It‚Äôs not just that the Apple Watch is slow; it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs slow <em>while promising to be faster</em>.‚Äù
</p></blockquote>
<p>Both Dan and Jason Snell followed up on this topic in the latest Six Colors subscriber podcast. The problem, they recognized, is that the first Apple Watch tried to do too much. Apple should instead focus on a few core features and make them fast.</p>
<p>Which features? I still use the Apple Watch every single day, and I use it for just three things: telling the time, tracking fitness (including reminding me to stand up), and glancing at notifications.</p>
<p>Some people have stopped wearing their watch every day. Again, <a href="../2016/01/apple-watch-still-pretty-great.html">that&#8217;s fine</a>. Curtis Herbert was falling into that category, until he went snowboarding with friends and realized how useful the Apple Watch is when you can‚Äôt get to your phone or tap buttons. <a href="http://blog.curtisherbert.com/apple-watch-makes-the-perfect-snowboarding-companion/">In an article about the snowboarding trip</a>, Curtis says the Apple Watch‚Äôs problems are solvable in future versions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  ‚ÄúSiri on the Watch will get faster. The battery situation will improve. The Watch as a whole will get faster. We&#8217;re spoiled by iPhone speeds and sometimes forget just how long it took us to get there, and the crap we dealt with until then.‚Äù
</p></blockquote>
<p>I‚Äôm not worried about the future of the watch either. Our early expectations were much too high ‚Äî¬†in contrast with the first iPhone, which exceeded all hopes because it was seemingly from the future already ‚Äî and it will take a couple more years to catch up to where we‚Äôd all like the watch to be. In the meantime, the watch is useful today, even slow-ish.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>When the iPad first shipped, many developers embraced completely separate apps for iPhone and iPad. The argument was that they were different platforms and deserved special design attention (and separate revenue). I never bought this argument, and eventually ‚Äî with the iPhone 6 Plus and multiple screen sizes ‚Äî everyone agreed that it just made more sense to use universal apps.</p>
<p>At the same time, there&#8217;s a parallel argument that an app on the iPad shouldn&#8217;t just be a &#8220;scaled up&#8221; version of the iPhone. That if you can&#8217;t invest the time to do a universal app properly, don&#8217;t bother.</p>
<p>The redesigned Twitter iOS app was a great example of this. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/twitter-aims-to-unify-ios-apps-updates-its-ipad-app/">It was widely mocked</a> for it&#8217;s poor use of space on the iPad.</p>
<p>With the iPad Pro and widespread iPad multitasking, I think this changes again. An iPad app that is designed exactly the same as its iPhone version is still very useful in slide-over and split screen. In fact, for many &#8220;iPad&#8221; apps I use every day on the iPad Pro, I use them in their compact layout <em>more often</em> than full screen.</p>
<p>My next app was designed for the iPhone. I spent some time trying to rework it with split views for the iPad Pro, but I just can&#8217;t justify the work right now to finish that effort. I&#8217;m going to ship it as a &#8220;lightweight&#8221; universal app anyway, though, so that it&#8217;s available in slide-over. To me, that&#8217;s a worthwhile compromise, significantly better than no offering on the iPad at all.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;ve talked about my hope for a new 4-inch iPhone several times on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, and a few times on this weblog, like <a href="../2015/11/4-inch-iphone-rumors.html">here</a> and <a href="../2015/07/matt-bonner-and-the-iphone-6.html">here</a>. The rumors keep growing, and <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2016/1/thoughts-on-an-iphone-6c">Stephen Hackett has written out his thoughts</a> on a potential iPhone 6C:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  ‚ÄúThe easy assumption is that the 6C would replace the aging 5S as the free-or-very-cheap option, but the recurring rumor of the 6C being powered by the A9 makes me think this may slide in roughly where the iPhone 6/6 Plus currently sits in the lineup.‚Äù
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see an A9, but I&#8217;m not counting on it. I think an A8 is fine too, mostly matching the internals of the latest iPod Touch. This wouldn&#8217;t be competitive with the iPhone 6S but it would still be a great upgrade from the iPhone 5S, which is the primary phone for anyone (like me) who still clings to the 4-inch design.</p>
<p>The larger 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch designs will remain the top of the line iPhones for years to come. The 6C doesn&#8217;t need to change that; it&#8217;s not a peer to the larger phones. It just needs to clean up all the money Apple&#8217;s left on the table from customers who want a smaller phone. I&#8217;ll buy one right away.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m going to mostly let John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/17/apple-tv-and-the-web">have the last word</a> on the Apple TV vs. the web debate, because I could write about this every day and my readers would run away before I run out of material. I&#8217;m glad John addressed the Mac vs. the command-line argument, though, because it didn&#8217;t seem quite right to me either. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The difference is that the command-line-less Mac was intended to <em>replace</em> command-line-based computers. The GUI relegated the command-line interface to a permanent tiny niche. Apple TV and Apple Watch aren‚Äôt like that at all ‚Äî they‚Äôre not meant to replace any device you already use to access the open web.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the most hopeful part of the Apple ecosystem as it relates to the web. Apple&#8217;s other platforms really do have a great web experience. Remember when web sites were faster and worked better on a PC than a Mac? If anything, the opposite is true now.</p>
<p>One of the themes I keep hearing is that a &#8220;web browser&#8221; on a TV will make for a poor user experience, so don&#8217;t bother. I tried to correct that misunderstanding in <a href="../2015/09/the-web-without-html.html">this post</a>; it&#8217;s not about standalone Safari, it&#8217;s about web technologies that could be used in native apps. But ignoring that, I think everyone too easily forgets what the mobile web was like before the iPhone.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, from the original iPhone introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;We wanted the best web browser in the world on our phone. Not a baby web browser or a WAP browser ‚Äî a <em>real</em> browser. [&#8230;] It is the first fully usable HTML browser on a phone.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>That was a breakthrough. I believe the same evolution is possible on tvOS ‚Äî to include parts of the open web and do it with a great user experience. You can start by weaving it together inside native apps. (I <a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6066362971586560">filed a bug with Apple</a> yesterday with a suggestion. It was marked as a duplicate.)</p>
<p>The web is at a fascinating, pivotal time right now. It has been shaken up by centralized publishing, closed platforms, and now content blockers. Users no longer value the concepts that made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> special. The web can still have a strong future, but we have to <em>try something</em>, and we have to try it on every platform we can.</p>

			<p>I‚Äôve always said the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are ginormous. <a href="http://www.concordmonitor.com/community/town-by-town/concord/17589745-95/rapping-and-rocking-with-matt-bonner">In an interview with the Concord Monitor</a>, San Antonio Spurs player Matt Bonner speculates that reaching his fingers across that screen contributed to an elbow injury:</p>

<p>Bring on the iPhone 6C in a 4-inch plastic design. The current phones are dangerously too big.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last week, to not much fanfare at all because nearly everyone had already lost interest, <a href="http://ello.co/">Ello</a> shipped their iPhone app. Credit to them for attempting to build a new social network, because this is extremely difficult. But it seems to me that Ello is a bust. They needed a more compelling pitch than simply ‚Äúno ads‚Äù.</p>
<p>(I‚Äôve heard some people joke about Ello‚Äôs monospaced font, but I kind of love that about Ello. If you want to differentiate yourself, design isn‚Äôt a bad place to start.)</p>
<p>App.net was ‚Äî and likely will be for many more years ‚Äî¬†the most successful attempt to compete with Twitter and Facebook. If they fell short, despite how many things they got right, how can another clone of existing social networks hope to do any better?</p>
<p>I wish I could cheer Ello on. Spend enough time clicking around on Ello and you discover a niche but fascinating community, full of beautiful art and photos. It‚Äôs just that after so many months, there‚Äôs still not even a mention of an official API on the <a href="https://ello.co/wtf/resources/feature-list/">planned features page</a>.</p>
<p>The next great social platform can‚Äôt be yet another centralized system. It has to be more distributed and more open even than App.net. It has to focus on writing and bloggers and embrace what is good about the web. Ello doesn‚Äôt do any of these things.</p>

			<p>Some people bought the iPhone 6 and then went back to the 5S. Some people bought the iPhone 6 Plus and then tried the 6. Some worked their way up to the 6 Plus after adapting to the 6. Some never upgraded to the 6 or 6 Plus because both are too big.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/04/06/life-with-the-iphone-6-plus">Marco‚Äôs post</a> is a good formal summary of a few write-ups I‚Äôve read this week:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  ‚ÄúHaving used an iPhone 6 full-time from its launch until these 6 Plus experiments over the last few weeks, I can confidently say that neither phone is extremely well-designed. Both have nontrivial and completely avoidable flaws. But the 6 Plus has bigger advantages over the other phones, while the 6 seems to sit in a mediocre middle ground.‚Äù
</p></blockquote>
<p>The lesson from all these switches couldn&#8217;t be more clear: there&#8217;s no longer one perfect iPhone for everyone. What works great for one person might be terrible for someone else. I personally love the 5C design ‚Äî the size of the screen, the way the plastic feels in my hand, flipping or spinning it on my fingers without worry that it‚Äôll slip, using it without a case, adding <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/colours/">a little color</a> to my life ‚Äî but many people never even tried it because it contains underpowered hardware compared to the latest models.</p>
<p>Apple would be crazy to discontinue any size. I&#8217;m more convinced than ever that we&#8217;ll see a 4-inch 6C alongside a new 6S and 6S Plus later this year. They won&#8217;t have identical specs, and that&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll happily pick the 4-inch model even if its camera is a year behind the cutting edge. The iPhone market is so ginormous now that I know there are millions of people who feel the same way.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  ‚ÄúI was convinced that the unique size and abilities of the Plus would change the way I use my phone. In my mind, it was large enough to be a small tablet, and I would do so many more things on it, potentially obviating the need for an iPad. That didn‚Äôt happen for a variety of reasons.‚Äù
</p></blockquote>
<p>As for me, I‚Äôm still using the iPhone 5C and think the design is nearly perfect. I wish I had the iPhone 6‚Äôs camera, but I‚Äôm not upgrading phones until Apple ships a ‚Äú6C‚Äù next year with a 4-inch screen.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>‚ÄúThis is it,‚Äù a friend said to me as we were walking up Market Street with other developers, late at night as WWDC was winding down several years ago. The iPhone had hit. The conference was getting bigger. Apple was on the verge of becoming a giant in the industry and you could feel it in the air ‚Äî a coming change that was obvious only from a distance because it disappeared as you reached for it, like San Francisco fog rolling over the bay. ‚ÄúThis is the height of the conference and it‚Äôs never going to be like this again.‚Äù</p>
<p>Looking back it perfectly captured what I think of as the second ‚Äúera‚Äù of WWDC. It was a kind of golden age for Mac and iOS developers, with a new generation of successful Mac indies and before the iOS race to the bottom was much past the starting line.</p>
<p>From my perspective, learning Mac development in the mid 90s, there are three distinct eras of Apple‚Äôs WWDC. My first WWDCs were at the San Jose Convention Center. The developer base was small enough that you consistently ran into everyone, companies like Metrowerks and even Adobe seemed to have an influence on the conference, and Apple frequently showed off new APIs that might not actually ship soon or ever. It was an exciting time to be a Mac developer but the rest of the world didn‚Äôt care. This was the backdrop for the failed Copland project, for Steve Jobs coming back, for the clash between Carbon and Cocoa, and the acceptance of Mac OS X.</p>
<p>The next era was at the move to San Francisco. The conference was getting bigger but Apple attempted to keep the events and themes that made WWDC the same, even for a while busing attendees to the beer bash in Cupertino. This is the time when the iPhone SDK arrived and the conference exploded. I think most developers will always look back at this time as something amazing. It‚Äôs the backdrop for that walk up Market Street and a dozen similar conversations.</p>
<p>Now we‚Äôre in the third modern era of WWDC, with one undeniable characteristic: a small percentage of developers can get a ticket to the conference. The community, however, is as strong as ever, and there‚Äôs still a desire to have WWDC be that ‚Äúone place‚Äù that developers can meet each year. It‚Äôs a need that smaller, regional conferences, no matter how important they are, just can‚Äôt fill.</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://jamesdempsey.net/2014/04/18/life-without-wwdc/">this post from James Dempsey</a> because it starts with the assumption that <em>not</em> getting a WWDC ticket is the new normal:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  ‚ÄúOnce something changes from being dependably available to rarely available, you begin to form alternate plans and take alternate paths.‚Äù
</p></blockquote>
<p>He‚Äôs right. Since it‚Äôs likely that Apple will continue to iterate slowly instead of making major changes to grow the conference, we‚Äôre better off adapting. By adapting we can focus on preserving the community aspects of WWDC that are arguably just as important as the technical tracks.</p>
<p>And change comes slowly to WWDC. I realized while watching (https://developer.apple.com/tech-talks/videos/) recently that Apple just doesn‚Äôt see a big problem. John Geleynse described a situation where only one person from a team is at WWDC; the rest of the company is back at the office watching videos and sending questions to their coworker at the conference to ask in the labs. Getting videos out the same day makes the conference more useful for both those without a ticket and actual attendees (and their team) too.</p>
<p>(I still have complaints about how WWDC tickets are distributed and why Apple doesn‚Äôt attempt to grow the conference a little more, but the lottery is an improvement over last year. See Core Intuition <a href="http://coreint.org/132">episodes 132</a> and <a href="http://coreint.org/133">133</a> for a full discussion.)</p>
<p>I‚Äôll be in San Francisco for a few days next week ‚Äî at <a href="http://www.altconf.com/">AltConf</a>, at the <a href="http://guestlistapp.com/events/250698">Cartoon Art Museum fundraiser</a>, catching up on session videos, <a href="http://bb.zaarly.com/">waiting in line</a> for coffee, hiding in my hotel room writing code, and getting some good food and drink with fellow developers. WWDC means something different now, but it matters just as much as it always has. Hope to see you there.</p>

			<p>I‚Äôve long been a fan of <a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a>, an iPhone app from my local Texas friends David Barnard and Justin Youens. It‚Äôs handy even for fairly simple tasks ‚Äî firing off web searches or other shortcuts into apps ‚Äî but it‚Äôs especially powerful when wiring up multiple apps together. For Sunlit it was nice to provide some full actions that Launch Center Pro users could use to automate bringing content into Sunlit.</p>
<p>Jonathan has <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/01/28/the-schemes-of-sunlit/">the full rundown on the URL schemes</a> that Sunlit supports and why we think they‚Äôre important. You can also use the Action Composer inside Launch Center Pro to access these actions without having to type them in.</p>
<p>And just today, <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/launch-center-pro-for-ipad-review/">Launch Center Pro for iPad shipped</a>. Check it out and explore <a href="http://actions.contrast.co/">some of the many apps</a> like <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> that are supported.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Apple has produced some amazing ads over the years. 1984, introducing the original Mac; the Think Different campaign; and one of my favorite this year, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoVW62mwSQQ">about photos</a>.</p>
<p>Their new ad ‚ÄúMisunderstood‚Äù is also great. <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/apple-airs-iphone-5s-holiday-commercial-featuring-airplay/">Federico Viticci has a rundown</a> of the details and how brilliantly it unfolds. I first noticed the video via Neven Mrgan, who had <a href="https://alpha.app.net/mrgan/post/17528712">this to say on App.net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs new ad (‚ÄòMisunderstood‚Äô) is technically perfect: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImlmVqH_5HM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImlmVqH_5HM</a> ‚Ä¶but I have to say it doesn‚Äôt quite ring true to me. Kids use iPhones to shut out the family and hang out within their own social circle (and that‚Äôs ok).‚Äù
</p></blockquote>
<p>He‚Äôs right. My daughters will likely escape to Instagram and various chat apps to connect with their friends through the holidays. But also I think ads like this work so well not because they represent reality, not because they‚Äôre true, but because we want them to be.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  ‚ÄúSearch results could be weighted by the device you are using quite heavily. Just like how on iPhone you don‚Äôt see iPad-only apps when searching the app store; on iPhone 5 you should be very unlikely to see apps that only support 3.5-inch screens.‚Äù

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Lots of new people are joining App.net. If you‚Äôre one of them, welcome! In this post I‚Äôm going to briefly review 3 of the most popular iPhone clients: <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/netbot/">Netbot</a>, <a href="http://tigerbears.com/felix/">Felix</a>, and <a href="http://riposteapp.net/">Riposte</a>. You can‚Äôt really go wrong with any of these three apps. And if you‚Äôre looking for a Mac client, my current favorite is <a href="http://kiwi-app.net/">Kiwi</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../images/2013/adn_netbot.html" alt="Netbot" border="0" width="180" height="259" style="float:right; padding: 5px;" /></p>
<p><strong>Netbot</strong> is nearly identical to Tweetbot. It shares most of the same source and all of the same UI design. That common heritage is great because it‚Äôs familiar to fans of Tweetbot, and it allowed Tapbots to launch onto App.net in a big way, leapfrogging all other clients that were under development at that time.</p>
<p>But the familiar design is a double-edged sword. Not just because the App.net API will evolve and diverge from the Twitter API, but because if you switch between both Tweetbot and Netbot often, you may need to be careful that you remember which app you‚Äôre posting from. This was a problem for me since I no longer post to Twitter, and the last thing I wanted to do was accidentally leave a new post there after a 5-month absence.</p>
<p>All the usual features you‚Äôd expect are present in Netbot: timeline, mentions, private messages, multiple accounts, and sync with Stream Marker. It even has an iPad version, which you may want to pick up even if you chose a different primary app on the iPhone.</p>
<p>Netbot also has one big feature that most App.net clients don‚Äôt have: post search. This is not part of the core App.net API. Tapbots rolled their own search server so that they could offer this feature inside the app.</p>
<p><em>Sidenote plug: if you want search for all the posts from anyone you‚Äôre following, and your own posts, consider my web app <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>. You can subscribe on the web or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/watermark-mobile/id566886320?ls=1&amp;mt=8">in the iPhone version</a>.</em></p>
<p><img src="../images/2013/adn_felix.html" alt="Felix" border="0" width="180" height="259" style="float:right; padding: 5px;" /></p>
<p><strong>Felix</strong> is possibly the most mature and actively maintained of the App.net-exclusive apps. You can tell <a href="https://alpha.app.net/billkunz">from his App.net posts</a> that the developer is passionate about App.net and determined to keep making his app better.</p>
<p>The current version supports all the basic features as well as push notifications, narrow inline image previews that take the full width of the screen, iCloud sync for drafts, starred conversations, and a brand new feature in version 1.5: collapsing posts you don‚Äôt want to see, similar to Twitterrific 5‚Äôs muffling. The only omission is that it does not yet support multiple accounts.</p>
<p>Felix is also unique in that it is the only one of these 3 apps that is not free. The other apps are counting on the <a href="http://blog.app.net/2012/09/27/announcing-the-app-net-developer-incentive-program/">Developer Incentive Program</a> to send them a check each month instead of relying on traditional sales. Felix is a good value at $5, though, and the price shouldn‚Äôt stop you from trying it out, especially as it is a very small amount compared to the paid App.net subscription itself.</p>
<p>There are a number of gestures in Felix. One interesting shortcut ‚Äî which may also be familiar to users of Twitterrific 5 ‚Äî is swipe right to quickly start a reply. I personally found that this breaks the illusion of gestures as direct manipulation, though. Since swiping to the left pulls forward the conversation, doing the reverse swipe should go back to the timeline. (<strong>Update:</strong> There‚Äôs actually a setting in Felix to switch this behavior.)</p>
<p>Felix also added a clever trick in its post composition window. You can swipe the text view to move the selection cursor one character over, or use two fingers to swipe across an entire word at a time. This saves a lot of time tapping-and-holding and fiddling with the magnifying glass. Felix is packed with little details and shortcuts like this.</p>

<p><strong>Riposte</strong> is beautifully done, with a clear design and a simple left/right gesture system to navigate through anything in the app. By default, there is no toolbar or tabs; everything is full-screen. Following Netbot‚Äôs lead, the developers of Riposte have decided to make their app free, and they have <a href="http://riposteapp.net/why-were-free.html">written up some thoughts on why</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple accounts are handled well and it‚Äôs easy to switch between them. Like Felix and Netbot, push notifications are supported. Riposte uses large square inline images. It‚Äôs got a great interactions view that shows users who have recently followed you or starred your posts.</p>
<p>Riposte mirrors Felix‚Äôs compose text view gestures, and Riposte was the first to introduce 2-finger swipes in that text view. I love that both apps now support these gestures about equally, and hope to see many more apps steal this feature soon.</p>
<p>Since it doesn‚Äôt have tabs, switching between timeline, mentions, global stream, and other views is done through a slide-out panel, <a href="http://kenyarmosh.com/ios-pattern-slide-out-navigation/">popularized in early apps</a> like Facebook, Path, and Sparrow, and now very common everywhere, including my own Twitter app <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>. It‚Äôs a swipe and a tap instead of the single tap of Netbot or Felix, but it is space-efficient and fits the flow of gestures in Riposte.</p>
<p>While Riposte holds its own against the competition, I think it will be chosen most not for its features but for its design. The striking full-screen look and consistent, discoverable gestures make this app feel great. It also has probably the most readable conversation view of any app I‚Äôve used, where the focused post appears immediately and then is surrounded with the full conversation using smaller text. That design is even maintained in HTML email when sending a conversation from the app.</p>

			<p><a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/03/on-fighting-about-smartphones/">Stephen Hackett of 512 Pixels</a>, commenting on <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/?p=133719">a Wired essay by Mat Honan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs just the headache I‚Äôve had since the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6GRFKWGn1k">Samsung Galaxy 4 event</a> or the fact that <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/why-iphone/">Apple‚Äôs turning up the heat</a>, but I find the increasingly defensive views held in the technology community increasingly offensive.‚Äù
</p></blockquote>
<p>I got into the Mac in the 1990s during the lead-up to Apple‚Äôs certain doom, so I spent quite a lot of time arguing with Windows users. The problem with the new version of that debate, Apple vs. Samsung and the smartphone wars, is that <em>I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs ever going to end</em>. There are good phones on either side, the pundits can‚Äôt wait for Apple to fail but Apple is strong, and there‚Äôs no hope to escape the noise for those of us who just want to build some apps.</p>

<p>Allow paying for Watermark inside the app with your iTunes account.</p>

			<p>I feel bad admitting it, because some of my friends are betting on iAd revenue to feed their family, but I&#8217;m just not on board with Apple running an advertising network. I don&#8217;t want to see ads in my apps, and I don&#8217;t want Apple to ever lose even a little of what it means to be a product-driven company.</p>
<p>We talk about this on Core Intuition. Nearly every chance I get I like to point out that all these free Google apps come at a cost. <a href="http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/1317967543">Take this tweet</a> from last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Google Voice is so awesome but I just think it&#8217;s dangerous to give Google this much power. Slippery slope, folks. You are not a customer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.metafilter.com/95152/Userdriven-discontent#3256046">And this comment</a> on MetaFilter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If you are not paying for it, you&#8217;re not the customer; you&#8217;re the product being sold.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Some apps should absolutely be ad-suported (such as a search engine or social network), and many can be freemium (free versions supported by higher-priced subscriptions), but when given a choice I&#8217;d rather pay a fair price for a good service. When your customers are not your users, the product will suffer.</p>
<p>I know the world is full of ads already. We&#8217;re used to it &mdash; numb to it, maybe. But think about what the App Store has done: millions of people are paying real money for apps that complement ad-supported web sites. These same people would never pay a subscription fee to use the web site, but they&#8217;ll pay a few bucks for the same features in an iPhone app <em>and it seems perfectly normal</em>.</p>
<p>Do we really want to give that marketplace up? Because once it&#8217;s gone, and iAds are the norm, it will be an uphill battle to get anyone to pay for anything.</p>

			<p>Alright, it&#8217;s been 2 weeks. How does the iPhone 4 hold up?</p>
<p>For me, there was less urgency to this launch then for previous iPhone releases. I wanted the 3GS on day one (video recording!) and of course I waited all afternoon for the original iPhone (shiny!). Likewise I couldn&#8217;t wait for the iPad. This time I viewed iMovie and FaceTime as the killer apps. Sign me up!</p>
<p>But I wasn&#8217;t willing to wait all day. I tried the same approach that had worked great for the iPad: show up late in the day after the madness has settled down. No luck this time. I waited about half an hour, then came back before closing and waited a couple more hours to get a voucher for the next day. Total wait time about 3.5 hours over 2 days and 3 visits.</p>
<p>To get it on day 1, most people waited 6 hours. I&#8217;m sure &#8220;John Gruber&#8217;s story on Flickr&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/4731689070/in/contacts/ was common too.</p>
<p>This was Apple&#8217;s most poorly-managed launch I&#8217;ve been to. The 3GS line was pretty fast. For iPad it was extremely quick &mdash; in and out in half an hour. I mostly blame the extra step of requiring activation in-store, but there were enough problems that I think this whole thing was mismanaged somewhere.</p>
<p>Some of the inconsistent messages I heard depending on which Apple Store employee I talked to:</p>
<ul>
<li>AT&amp;T activation is not the bottleneck / yes it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are selling 30 phones every 10 minutes / no idea how long the wait is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&#8217;ll shut down the line at 7pm and give out vouchers / staying open until 2am.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vouchers will allow you to skip everyone else in line the next day / you&#8217;re guaranteed a phone but have to wait in line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also &#8220;collected a few tweets about the launch&#8221;:http://tweetlib.com/manton/iphone4.</p>
<p>Anyway, the phone. It&#8217;s the best phone I&#8217;ve ever seen. No question.</p>
<p>Now that some time has passed, I think I can comment on the reception issue. It&#8217;s real. Outside my house, I don&#8217;t notice it. But my street is a notoriously bad dead zone, and while I don&#8217;t get any more dropped calls than I used to, I can no longer hold the phone in the palm of my left hand when using mobile Safari. It&#8217;s pretty frustrating because I&#8217;ve been holding the phone this way for 3 years. It&#8217;s awkward to break the habit.</p>
<p>Having said that, I&#8217;ll close with the same thing I told strangers who came up asking about the phone. It&#8217;s easy to overlook the reception issue because of how great the rest of the phone is, and all existing iPhone users will love the iPhone 4. Eventually I&#8217;ll just cave in and buy a bumper.</p>

			<p>My first reaction when I started reading &#8220;The Kids Are All Right&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/kids_are_all_right on Daring Fireball was: Well, I had to disagree with a John Gruber essay eventually, might as well be this one. There was no developer program fee when I started building Mac apps! You could write whatever you wanted and share it with friends.</p>
<p>But then I thought more about the $99 hurdle. What was I doing as a teenager and would the procedures Apple has in place now have stopped me? (For context, I&#8217;m 34.)</p>
<p>I started programming for the Mac with THINK Pascal, a beautiful little development environment. Then I moved to C with Dave Mark&#8217;s book, which came with a C compiler on a floppy inside the back cover. Eventually I saved up and bought Symantec C++. Even at an educational discount these were expensive compared to the free Xcode of today.</p>
<p>At that point I&#8217;m pretty heavily invested in the Mac, but the killer was the documentation. I&#8217;m sure I spent hundreds of dollars on &#8220;Inside Macintosh&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Macintosh books. Our senior year in high school, my friends and I would meet at a restaurant before class for coffee and breakfast. I remember I&#8217;d get there early and sit in the booth with one of my oversized volumes of Inside Mac, taking in too much caffeine for my own good while I devoured every page, even the advanced topics that were still over my head.</p>
<p>I lived and breathed this stuff pretty heavily for a few years. To imagine letting a $99 iPhone dev fee and some locked-down APIs prevent me from building apps is laughable. Great computers inspire people to build new software. That&#8217;s how it was when I got my first Mac, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s that way for the new generation of young iPhone and iPad tinkerers.</p>
<p>One day I hope the App Store will be more open. But it is what it is. I&#8217;ll point out where I think Apple can improve, and then I&#8217;ll build and ship anyway. It makes no sense to sit around and complain on my blog about the good old days while some kid half my age is taking his or her idea all the way to the top of the App Store and owning the platform of the future.</p>

			<p>It appears I was too optimistic &#8220;in my last post&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/03/24hour_review_times.html about the App Store getting better.</p>
<p>The iPhone version of Snowtape, in development for months, &#8220;was rejected&#8221;:http://www.vemedio.com/blog/posts/134 because it could let users record and share audio from the internet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;His sole words were, that there are lots of things missing in the SDK agreement and that they can not foresee any circumstance that leads to a denial of an app. That&#8217;s right! We did not violate any paragraph of the SDK, yet they forbid us distributing our app.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The developer removed the ability to transfer audio files off the phone and then Apple let the app through.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s this post &#8220;on the developer forums&#8221;:https://devforums.apple.com/message/190892 about an iPad app rejection because they recreated a UI innovation from the new Photos app. Apple said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The application uses a tap and a pinch to expand feature that is present in Apple iPad Applications. This action is associated solely with Apple applications, and we kindly ask that you update your app appropriately.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing a bunch of iPhone and iPad development this week. The more I work with it, the more I love the platform. But it just takes a couple rejections to sour the whole experience.</p>
<p>And yes, I realize I&#8217;m posting this on one of the most exciting days in the history of the App Store. The first round of iPad apps hitting the store today look fantastic.</p>
