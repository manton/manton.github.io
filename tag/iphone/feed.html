				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2016/07/jack_off">John Gruber has an article</a> outlining the 5 (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/07/30/option-6">or 6</a>) most likely options for what headphones Apple should include with the new Lightning-only iPhone. His hope is on wireless:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  My hope is that they ship wireless ear buds. When Apple eliminates ports, they tend to do so in favor of wireless technology. Pushing wireless as the default would solve the problem of listening to audio while charging the device, too.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe. I’m not in any hurry to see a Bluetooth-dominated headphone world, and I&#8217;m not sure Apple Support is either. Wired headphones work every single time you plug them in.</p>
<p>As Gruber points out, wireless headphones are also an upsell opportunity. While cheap Bluetooth headphones can be found, Apple&#8217;s Beats are $100 more expensive for wireless. Seems like this extra cost would unnecessarily eat into their margins.</p>
<p>Of course, I have no idea what Apple will do. I just know what I think they <em>should</em> do.</p>
<p>Apple should include Lightning ear buds in the box, and an adapter for older headphones. I don’t expect they will do this forever — the first year would be enough. But this small gesture of including an adapter would mostly erase the negative reviews and user frustration for Apple’s biggest repeat customers: not me, because I intend to keep my iPhone SE for a while, but for everyone who buys a new iPhone each year.</p>
<p>Removing the 3.5mm headphone jack will be the first time Apple has removed a major feature on the iPhone. They can spin Lightning as an improvement all they want; customers with existing headphones will be annoyed. Including an adapter would minimize the inconvenience at launch, without locking Apple in to any long-term technical compromise.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/2016/02/why-slowness-is-killing-the-apple-watch/">Dan Moren wrote an essay for Six Colors last week</a> about why slowness is such a problem for the Apple Watch:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The stale data and the lack of speed means that either you have to stare at your Watch for several seconds and hope the data updates; or tap on the complication to load the Watch app, which as we all know takes a good long while as well; or simply give up and pull out your phone. [&#8230;] It’s not just that the Apple Watch is slow; it’s that it’s slow <em>while promising to be faster</em>.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Both Dan and Jason Snell followed up on this topic in the latest Six Colors subscriber podcast. The problem, they recognized, is that the first Apple Watch tried to do too much. Apple should instead focus on a few core features and make them fast.</p>
<p>Which features? I still use the Apple Watch every single day, and I use it for just three things: telling the time, tracking fitness (including reminding me to stand up), and glancing at notifications.</p>
<p>Some people have stopped wearing their watch every day. Again, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/apple-watch-still-pretty-great.html">that&#8217;s fine</a>. Curtis Herbert was falling into that category, until he went snowboarding with friends and realized how useful the Apple Watch is when you can’t get to your phone or tap buttons. <a href="http://blog.curtisherbert.com/apple-watch-makes-the-perfect-snowboarding-companion/">In an article about the snowboarding trip</a>, Curtis says the Apple Watch’s problems are solvable in future versions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Siri on the Watch will get faster. The battery situation will improve. The Watch as a whole will get faster. We&#8217;re spoiled by iPhone speeds and sometimes forget just how long it took us to get there, and the crap we dealt with until then.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not worried about the future of the watch either. Our early expectations were much too high — in contrast with the first iPhone, which exceeded all hopes because it was seemingly from the future already — and it will take a couple more years to catch up to where we’d all like the watch to be. In the meantime, the watch is useful today, even slow-ish.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the iPad first shipped, many developers embraced completely separate apps for iPhone and iPad. The argument was that they were different platforms and deserved special design attention (and separate revenue). I never bought this argument, and eventually — with the iPhone 6 Plus and multiple screen sizes — everyone agreed that it just made more sense to use universal apps.</p>
<p>At the same time, there&#8217;s a parallel argument that an app on the iPad shouldn&#8217;t just be a &#8220;scaled up&#8221; version of the iPhone. That if you can&#8217;t invest the time to do a universal app properly, don&#8217;t bother.</p>
<p>The redesigned Twitter iOS app was a great example of this. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/twitter-aims-to-unify-ios-apps-updates-its-ipad-app/">It was widely mocked</a> for it&#8217;s poor use of space on the iPad.</p>
<p>With the iPad Pro and widespread iPad multitasking, I think this changes again. An iPad app that is designed exactly the same as its iPhone version is still very useful in slide-over and split screen. In fact, for many &#8220;iPad&#8221; apps I use every day on the iPad Pro, I use them in their compact layout <em>more often</em> than full screen.</p>
<p>My next app was designed for the iPhone. I spent some time trying to rework it with split views for the iPad Pro, but I just can&#8217;t justify the work right now to finish that effort. I&#8217;m going to ship it as a &#8220;lightweight&#8221; universal app anyway, though, so that it&#8217;s available in slide-over. To me, that&#8217;s a worthwhile compromise, significantly better than no offering on the iPad at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve talked about my hope for a new 4-inch iPhone several times on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, and a few times on this weblog, like <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/4-inch-iphone-rumors.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/matt-bonner-and-the-iphone-6.html">here</a>. The rumors keep growing, and <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2016/1/thoughts-on-an-iphone-6c">Stephen Hackett has written out his thoughts</a> on a potential iPhone 6C:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The easy assumption is that the 6C would replace the aging 5S as the free-or-very-cheap option, but the recurring rumor of the 6C being powered by the A9 makes me think this may slide in roughly where the iPhone 6/6 Plus currently sits in the lineup.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see an A9, but I&#8217;m not counting on it. I think an A8 is fine too, mostly matching the internals of the latest iPod Touch. This wouldn&#8217;t be competitive with the iPhone 6S but it would still be a great upgrade from the iPhone 5S, which is the primary phone for anyone (like me) who still clings to the 4-inch design.</p>
<p>The larger 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch designs will remain the top of the line iPhones for years to come. The 6C doesn&#8217;t need to change that; it&#8217;s not a peer to the larger phones. It just needs to clean up all the money Apple&#8217;s left on the table from customers who want a smaller phone. I&#8217;ll buy one right away.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to mostly let John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/17/apple-tv-and-the-web">have the last word</a> on the Apple TV vs. the web debate, because I could write about this every day and my readers would run away before I run out of material. I&#8217;m glad John addressed the Mac vs. the command-line argument, though, because it didn&#8217;t seem quite right to me either. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The difference is that the command-line-less Mac was intended to <em>replace</em> command-line-based computers. The GUI relegated the command-line interface to a permanent tiny niche. Apple TV and Apple Watch aren’t like that at all — they’re not meant to replace any device you already use to access the open web.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the most hopeful part of the Apple ecosystem as it relates to the web. Apple&#8217;s other platforms really do have a great web experience. Remember when web sites were faster and worked better on a PC than a Mac? If anything, the opposite is true now.</p>
<p>One of the themes I keep hearing is that a &#8220;web browser&#8221; on a TV will make for a poor user experience, so don&#8217;t bother. I tried to correct that misunderstanding in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/the-web-without-html.html">this post</a>; it&#8217;s not about standalone Safari, it&#8217;s about web technologies that could be used in native apps. But ignoring that, I think everyone too easily forgets what the mobile web was like before the iPhone.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, from the original iPhone introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;We wanted the best web browser in the world on our phone. Not a baby web browser or a WAP browser — a <em>real</em> browser. [&#8230;] It is the first fully usable HTML browser on a phone.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>That was a breakthrough. I believe the same evolution is possible on tvOS — to include parts of the open web and do it with a great user experience. You can start by weaving it together inside native apps. (I <a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6066362971586560">filed a bug with Apple</a> yesterday with a suggestion. It was marked as a duplicate.)</p>
<p>The web is at a fascinating, pivotal time right now. It has been shaken up by centralized publishing, closed platforms, and now content blockers. Users no longer value the concepts that made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> special. The web can still have a strong future, but we have to <em>try something</em>, and we have to try it on every platform we can.</p>

<p>Bring on the iPhone 6C in a 4-inch plastic design. The current phones are dangerously too big.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, to not much fanfare at all because nearly everyone had already lost interest, <a href="http://ello.co/">Ello</a> shipped their iPhone app. Credit to them for attempting to build a new social network, because this is extremely difficult. But it seems to me that Ello is a bust. They needed a more compelling pitch than simply “no ads”.</p>
<p>(I’ve heard some people joke about Ello’s monospaced font, but I kind of love that about Ello. If you want to differentiate yourself, design isn’t a bad place to start.)</p>
<p>App.net was — and likely will be for many more years — the most successful attempt to compete with Twitter and Facebook. If they fell short, despite how many things they got right, how can another clone of existing social networks hope to do any better?</p>
<p>I wish I could cheer Ello on. Spend enough time clicking around on Ello and you discover a niche but fascinating community, full of beautiful art and photos. It’s just that after so many months, there’s still not even a mention of an official API on the <a href="https://ello.co/wtf/resources/feature-list/">planned features page</a>.</p>
<p>The next great social platform can’t be yet another centralized system. It has to be more distributed and more open even than App.net. It has to focus on writing and bloggers and embrace what is good about the web. Ello doesn’t do any of these things.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people bought the iPhone 6 and then went back to the 5S. Some people bought the iPhone 6 Plus and then tried the 6. Some worked their way up to the 6 Plus after adapting to the 6. Some never upgraded to the 6 or 6 Plus because both are too big.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/04/06/life-with-the-iphone-6-plus">Marco’s post</a> is a good formal summary of a few write-ups I’ve read this week:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Having used an iPhone 6 full-time from its launch until these 6 Plus experiments over the last few weeks, I can confidently say that neither phone is extremely well-designed. Both have nontrivial and completely avoidable flaws. But the 6 Plus has bigger advantages over the other phones, while the 6 seems to sit in a mediocre middle ground.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The lesson from all these switches couldn&#8217;t be more clear: there&#8217;s no longer one perfect iPhone for everyone. What works great for one person might be terrible for someone else. I personally love the 5C design — the size of the screen, the way the plastic feels in my hand, flipping or spinning it on my fingers without worry that it’ll slip, using it without a case, adding <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/colours/">a little color</a> to my life — but many people never even tried it because it contains underpowered hardware compared to the latest models.</p>
<p>Apple would be crazy to discontinue any size. I&#8217;m more convinced than ever that we&#8217;ll see a 4-inch 6C alongside a new 6S and 6S Plus later this year. They won&#8217;t have identical specs, and that&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll happily pick the 4-inch model even if its camera is a year behind the cutting edge. The iPhone market is so ginormous now that I know there are millions of people who feel the same way.</p>

  “I was convinced that the unique size and abilities of the Plus would change the way I use my phone. In my mind, it was large enough to be a small tablet, and I would do so many more things on it, potentially obviating the need for an iPad. That didn’t happen for a variety of reasons.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>As for me, I’m still using the iPhone 5C and think the design is nearly perfect. I wish I had the iPhone 6’s camera, but I’m not upgrading phones until Apple ships a “6C” next year with a 4-inch screen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“This is it,” a friend said to me as we were walking up Market Street with other developers, late at night as WWDC was winding down several years ago. The iPhone had hit. The conference was getting bigger. Apple was on the verge of becoming a giant in the industry and you could feel it in the air — a coming change that was obvious only from a distance because it disappeared as you reached for it, like San Francisco fog rolling over the bay. “This is the height of the conference and it’s never going to be like this again.”</p>
<p>Looking back it perfectly captured what I think of as the second “era” of WWDC. It was a kind of golden age for Mac and iOS developers, with a new generation of successful Mac indies and before the iOS race to the bottom was much past the starting line.</p>
<p>From my perspective, learning Mac development in the mid 90s, there are three distinct eras of Apple’s WWDC. My first WWDCs were at the San Jose Convention Center. The developer base was small enough that you consistently ran into everyone, companies like Metrowerks and even Adobe seemed to have an influence on the conference, and Apple frequently showed off new APIs that might not actually ship soon or ever. It was an exciting time to be a Mac developer but the rest of the world didn’t care. This was the backdrop for the failed Copland project, for Steve Jobs coming back, for the clash between Carbon and Cocoa, and the acceptance of Mac OS X.</p>
<p>The next era was at the move to San Francisco. The conference was getting bigger but Apple attempted to keep the events and themes that made WWDC the same, even for a while busing attendees to the beer bash in Cupertino. This is the time when the iPhone SDK arrived and the conference exploded. I think most developers will always look back at this time as something amazing. It’s the backdrop for that walk up Market Street and a dozen similar conversations.</p>
<p>Now we’re in the third modern era of WWDC, with one undeniable characteristic: a small percentage of developers can get a ticket to the conference. The community, however, is as strong as ever, and there’s still a desire to have WWDC be that “one place” that developers can meet each year. It’s a need that smaller, regional conferences, no matter how important they are, just can’t fill.</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://jamesdempsey.net/2014/04/18/life-without-wwdc/">this post from James Dempsey</a> because it starts with the assumption that <em>not</em> getting a WWDC ticket is the new normal:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Once something changes from being dependably available to rarely available, you begin to form alternate plans and take alternate paths.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s right. Since it’s likely that Apple will continue to iterate slowly instead of making major changes to grow the conference, we’re better off adapting. By adapting we can focus on preserving the community aspects of WWDC that are arguably just as important as the technical tracks.</p>
<p>And change comes slowly to WWDC. I realized while watching (https://developer.apple.com/tech-talks/videos/) recently that Apple just doesn’t see a big problem. John Geleynse described a situation where only one person from a team is at WWDC; the rest of the company is back at the office watching videos and sending questions to their coworker at the conference to ask in the labs. Getting videos out the same day makes the conference more useful for both those without a ticket and actual attendees (and their team) too.</p>
<p>(I still have complaints about how WWDC tickets are distributed and why Apple doesn’t attempt to grow the conference a little more, but the lottery is an improvement over last year. See Core Intuition <a href="http://coreint.org/132">episodes 132</a> and <a href="http://coreint.org/133">133</a> for a full discussion.)</p>
<p>I’ll be in San Francisco for a few days next week — at <a href="http://www.altconf.com/">AltConf</a>, at the <a href="http://guestlistapp.com/events/250698">Cartoon Art Museum fundraiser</a>, catching up on session videos, <a href="http://bb.zaarly.com">waiting in line</a> for coffee, hiding in my hotel room writing code, and getting some good food and drink with fellow developers. WWDC means something different now, but it matters just as much as it always has. Hope to see you there.</p>
