				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.thecave.com/2014/10/13/iphone-6-plus-is-too-big-for-me-but-i-bought-it-anyways/">Kirby Turner wrote</a> about <em>needing</em> an iPhone 6 Plus as a developer but not really <em>wanting</em> one as a user:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;As a developer what I really want is an iPod touch Plus. If Apple were selling an iPod touch Plus that is the same as the iPhone 6 Plus minus the phone, then I would buy it in an instant. That way I could continue using my iPhone 5 as my primary phone device and the iPod touch Plus as a test device.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve talked about skipping this phone generation on <a href="http://coreint.org/">the podcast</a> a few times. I already got out of the yearly updates when I kept the 4S forever and then got the 5C instead of the 5S. After seeing the 6 Plus in person at the Apple Store and with everyone who had one at Çingleton, I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with my decision. But I&#8217;d strongly consider replacing my iPad Mini with a 5.5-inch iPod Touch.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">Tweet Library 2.6</a> shipped today after 13 days waiting for review from Apple. This release adds support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen sizes, as well as improvements to sharing so that iOS 8 extensions can be used, and a fix for an annoying random crashing bug.</p>
<p>I also finally dropped iOS 5 and 6 support for this release. I wanted to support the iPad 1 as long as possible because those were my very first customers when I launched Tweet Library 1.0 almost exactly 4 years ago. I hope they got an incredible value out of the app in that time (all upgrades have been free). It feels good to turn a corner and require iOS 7.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://coreint.org/156">Episode 156 of Core Intuition</a> is out. Daniel and I discuss the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and what they might mean for the future of the iPhone product line.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now convinced that Apple will have something like a 6C next year to maintain the 4-inch design. It will never have the best camera or longest battery life — that will be reserved for the larger phones — but there will be 3 fully supported sizes with some core modern features like Touch ID and Apple Pay.</p>
<p>We also talk about updating your app for the new screen sizes and iOS 8. My update to Tweet Library is still waiting for review, but hopefully will be approved soon.</p>
