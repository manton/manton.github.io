				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://9to5mac.com/2016/02/26/apple-iphone-se-4-inch-2016/">Mark Gurman of 9to5Mac reports</a> that the new 4-inch iPhone will be called simply “iPhone SE”, not “5SE”. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/iphone-5se.html">As I said before</a>, I don’t really care what it’s called, but this is good news nevertheless.</p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/02/26/9to5mac-se">John Gruber adds</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Isn’t it more accurate to think of this as an iPhone 6S in a 4-inch body than as an iPhone 5S with ‘upgraded internals’? Other than the display, aren’t the ‘internals’ the defining characteristics of any iPhone?”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with John. Other than the screen size, this phone will feel a lot like an iPhone 6S. And because I love the smaller size, I personally think it will have the <em>best</em> of both the 5S and 6S.</p>
<p>Prediction: this phone is going to be much more popular than people expect. I won’t be surprised if it takes the 6S Plus’s spot as the 2nd most popular iPhone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the iPad first shipped, many developers embraced completely separate apps for iPhone and iPad. The argument was that they were different platforms and deserved special design attention (and separate revenue). I never bought this argument, and eventually — with the iPhone 6 Plus and multiple screen sizes — everyone agreed that it just made more sense to use universal apps.</p>
<p>At the same time, there&#8217;s a parallel argument that an app on the iPad shouldn&#8217;t just be a &#8220;scaled up&#8221; version of the iPhone. That if you can&#8217;t invest the time to do a universal app properly, don&#8217;t bother.</p>
<p>The redesigned Twitter iOS app was a great example of this. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/twitter-aims-to-unify-ios-apps-updates-its-ipad-app/">It was widely mocked</a> for it&#8217;s poor use of space on the iPad.</p>
<p>With the iPad Pro and widespread iPad multitasking, I think this changes again. An iPad app that is designed exactly the same as its iPhone version is still very useful in slide-over and split screen. In fact, for many &#8220;iPad&#8221; apps I use every day on the iPad Pro, I use them in their compact layout <em>more often</em> than full screen.</p>
<p>My next app was designed for the iPhone. I spent some time trying to rework it with split views for the iPad Pro, but I just can&#8217;t justify the work right now to finish that effort. I&#8217;m going to ship it as a &#8220;lightweight&#8221; universal app anyway, though, so that it&#8217;s available in slide-over. To me, that&#8217;s a worthwhile compromise, significantly better than no offering on the iPad at all.</p>
