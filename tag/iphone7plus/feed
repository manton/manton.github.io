				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Federico Viticci published a great <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/iphone-7-computer-from-the-future/">review of the iPhone 7 for MacStories</a> last week. He opened with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  After nearly two years spent using a 5.5-inch iPhone, I&#8217;m accustomed to not having a compact phone anymore. The iPhone <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/iphone-6-plus-review/">6 Plus</a> and 6s Plus <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/how-the-6s-plus-is-reshaping-my-iphone-experience/">have reshaped my iPhone experience</a> for a simple reason: they give me more of the most important device in my life.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Followed by the main theme of his review:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In many ways, the iPhone 7 feels like a portable computer from the future – only in a tangible, practical way that is here with us today.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit to some jealousy of Federico&#8217;s iOS-only lifestyle. Apple&#8217;s mobile OS is fun to use in part because of its simplicity and in part because of its inherent mobility.</p>
<p>If I could only choose one computing device — one phone, no tablets, no Macs — I would get an iPhone 7 Plus. The largest phone would make for a great mini tablet, nice for photography, writing, and the web. Maybe when I retire from living in Xcode and Objective-C, I&#8217;ll daydream about traveling the country with a backpack and iPhone 7 Plus, never tied to my desk again.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, I&#8217;m fortunate that I can have a Mac and a few iOS devices. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/10/real-work-on-the-ipad.html">When I go to a conference</a>, I take the iPad Mini and big iPad Pro along with my phone. Because I have those larger devices available, I always want the convenience of carrying the smallest phone when I&#8217;m not sitting down to work. The weight and feel of the iPhone SE is perfect.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a point in Federico Viticci&#8217;s review where he covers the headphone jack controversy. He hints at a common justification I&#8217;ve heard for some of Apple&#8217;s decisions, and I think it&#8217;s kind of a defeatist attitude that is worth commenting on:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  You and I might wax philosophical about the beauty of RSS, HTML, MP4, and USB, but millions of people only demand easy tech and engaging social apps.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Federico is right, but this fact is <em>exactly why</em> those of us who are passionate about open standards must make a strong case for them. We can&#8217;t leave such important decisions only in the hands of big corporations and fickle customers. It&#8217;s our responsibility to write about what we believe is best for the web and best for the tech industry.</p>
