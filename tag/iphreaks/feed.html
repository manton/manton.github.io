				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I forgot to mention a few weeks back that I was a guest on <a href="http://iphreaksshow.com/039-iphreaks-show-subscription-apis-for-recurring-revenue-with-manton-reece/">the iPhreaks Show podcast</a>. The format is a panel of regulars and usually one guest, making it feel more like a roundtable discussion. They had me on to talk about subscription pricing: charging every month for your app or service.</p>
<p>Some of what we talked about was covered in 2 talks I gave last year about subscriptions, at NSConference and CocoaConf Dallas. I’ve finally pulled together the slides from these talks and put the latest version from CocoaConf <a href="http://www.manton.org/misc/Subscription_APIs_CocoaConf_2013.pdf">here as a PDF</a> (17 MB). It’s different than the NSConference one, but I think works better standalone. You can still <a href="http://my.nsconference.com">purchase the videos from NSConference 2013</a> to get my talk and many other great ones.</p>
<p>This week I was also on <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/41-manton-reece/">the Release Notes podcast</a> with Joe Cieplinski and Charles Perry. They do a great job each episode focusing on something from the business side of running an indie software company, and they’ve had some excellent guests as well. From the show notes for episode 41:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We talk about creating products vs. services, changing products from free to paid, and the advantages and challenges of subscription pricing. Manton also shares his experience in creating apps like Sunlit that build on top of other services like Twitter and App.net, his recent foray into freemium pricing, and the launch of the new Core Intuition Jobs Board.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you enjoy <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, I think you’ll really like Release Notes. Let me know if you have any feedback on the show.</p>
