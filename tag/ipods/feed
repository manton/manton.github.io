				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Steve Jobs in yesterday&#8217;s special event, discussing the white iPods:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a huge success for us, and therefore it&#8217;s time to replace it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The new iPods look great. At first I was disappointed by the $1.99 price for music videos and TV shows, but when you do the math it is only a little more than buying DVDs. And what about the small quality, only 320&#215;240? In the name of science I dropped $2 to test it.</p>
<p>Last week, thanks to eBay, I became the proud owner of 2 tickets to see U2 in Houston at the end of the month. I&#8217;ve seen every U2 tour since ZooTV over a decade ago, so I wasn&#8217;t about to let little things like &#8220;too busy&#8221; and &#8220;money&#8221; stand in the way this time. Our seats are fairly horrible, but the price was right and all that matters is that we are there.</p>
<p>So buying a U2 music video was a natural choice. The download time was reasonable. I clicked it to full-screen on my Cinema Display and sat down 6 feet away. It actually looked good. 30 frames per second doesn&#8217;t hurt either. I could definitely watch TV shows this way.</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit from the Apple event. Disney&#8217;s new CEO Bob Iger was introduced quite warmly by Steve Jobs, and Iger even joked that he still hoped an agreement could be reached between Disney and Pixar for continuing distribution of their films. Sounds like that could happen after all.</p>
