				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To cope with his dislike for how Twitter treats the microblog part of their platform, <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/05/03/the_man_who_deleted_all_his_tweets">Brent Simmons has adopted a strategy</a> of deleting old tweets:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “So I haven’t deleted my account or made it private. I will respond to some messages. It’s just that I’ll delete my response after a day or a week or whatever so that Twitter is a chat-only service for me.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/justin">Justin Williams joked</a> that Brent and I are now the sole inhabitants of “Manton Island”. That’s funny but it’s actually backwards; it’s <em>Twitter</em> that is the island. Everyone is there, though, in an overpopulated mess, so they don’t realize they’re cut off from the rest of the world — the open web, designed 25 years ago as an interconnected system of countless islands.</p>
<p>The risk on Twitter Island is that the monarchy can change the rules. Cars that once were great now can’t run on the road. Windows that once had a beautiful view now only look inward. Eventually maybe the whole thing sinks, with waterlogged tweets (which you thought you controlled) floating above the surface like lost bubbles over Atlantis.</p>
<p>The rule of the open web is much simpler: you own your content if it’s on your domain name. That’s why I have <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">my microblog posts here on manton.org</a> and with <a href="http://www.manton.org/snippets.xml">their own RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve been working on a new project that I think is the next step for microblogging. It still has elements of being an island, as most web apps inherently do. But mine isn’t just an island; it’s an <em>island builder</em>, with massive bridges to the mainland, to other nearby islands, to places we haven’t even dreamed up yet.</p>
