				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What I like most about the &#8220;FastScripts 2.4 release&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/823/fastscripts-2-4 is that Daniel was willing to completely change the product evaluation terms to give new life to the product and get it out to more users.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I have been thinking for some time of eliminating FastScripts Lite. Customers found it confusing to differentiate between the versions, and I found it tedious to artificially maintain two versions. With the new, liberal evaluation terms in FastScripts 2.4, all of the old Lite functionality and much more is now included for free in the full version.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s always a risk to make a pricing or demo limit change. Whether accurate or not, I imagine the financial side of product development as a delicate tower of blocks, where the slightest change could cause your whole sales structure to come crashing down. For that reason I tend to not touch anything if it is working, but I recognize that I am probably holding my business back at the same time by not being more flexible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Daniel Jalkut&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/504/core-intuition-traveling-luddites and I just posted the 2nd episode of &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/. I&#8217;m not sure which is a bigger milestone: starting the podcast to begin with or sticking with it for at least two shows. I think the podcast is coming together well and the feedback we&#8217;ve received so far backs that up.</p>
<p>This episode feels a bit more content heavy than the previous one. We talked about what it&#8217;s like to work while traveling, tech books and some thoughts on the 3rd edition of Cocoa Programming by Aaron Hillegass, and then dedicated most of the last half to distributed version control systems such as Git. Even though it is just days before WWDC, we only touched on WWDC indirectly. I expect there will be enough to talk about after next week to fill more than a few shows.</p>
<p>Editing the show continues to be a challenge but it&#8217;s so rewarding, just being able to slowly craft the episode from the recordings. You tell a little lie every time you tweak the original source audio, but hopefully the end product feels more authentic or at least fresh. It makes me appreciate even more the work Ryan does on &#8220;The Talk Show&#8221;:http://www.thetalkshow.net/. Our goal is to improve the quality each episode until we reach a point we are happy with, so if you have any feedback I&#8217;d love to hear it. After WWDC I&#8217;m going to invest in some real headphones. I was shocked how different the show sounds between my speakers, cheap headphones, and iPhone.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t subscribed yet, you can now find the &#8220;listing on iTunes&#8221;:http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=281777685 and get it synced to your iPod or iPhone in just a few clicks. Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many new tech endeavors for 2008, it was &#8220;announced first on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/danielpunkass/statuses/823571610. Core Intuition is a new podcast from Daniel Jalkut and me, with a focus on the daily life of a Mac developer and whatever related subjects are going through our heads. There was so little time between the &#8220;let&#8217;s do it&#8221; idea to recording and edit and web site and &#8220;Twitter account&#8221;:http://twitter.com/coreint that I might not have believed it actually happened if I had blinked, but &#8220;here it is&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/. Expect the traditional iTunes page, blog, and other formalities to follow soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daniel&#8217;s blog post&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/500/core-intuition has more on the announcement. He also has comments enabled, so feel free to jump over there and post feedback, unless it&#8217;s the angry, negative kind of feedback in which case please send a private email to &#8220;feedback@coreint.org&#8221;:mailto:feedback@coreint.org. :-)</p>
<p>Thanks for listening. We&#8217;ll be doing these regularly so please subscribe in iTunes if you want to catch the next episodes.</p>
