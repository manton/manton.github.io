				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you were to build a weblog publishing system, would you start from scratch or build on an existing tool? There’s a healthy market for WordPress-powered hosting, for example, from <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> itself to <a href="http://wpengine.com/">WP Engine</a>. People know and trust these tools.</p>
<p>I was faced with this question for my microblogging platform. My requirements were pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The published site needed to be 100% static, so that I could host it anywhere.</li>
<li>The template system needed to be widely used, so that I could draw on existing themes and provide customization for users later.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> looked like a great choice. I’m so happy with how well this has worked that I mention Jekyll in the marketing and footer of published sites. It’s a brand that can help give users confidence that this is built on something solid, and that if they need to migrate to self-hosted, there’s a path.</p>
<p>On top of Jekyll, I built a web interface for publishing and deleting posts, changing themes, and I added XML-RPC support so that you can use external blog editors like MarsEdit. Plus there’s a native iPhone app for posting.</p>
<p>All of this enables another feature that I’m very excited about: full mirroring to <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. When you publish a microblog site, you can have it upload all the Markdown and HTML to a GitHub repository. This is a great way to export or mirror your content.</p>
<p>I think it’s a good foundation. Publishing is actually a small part of the overall microblog platform I’ve built, but it’s an important one. I can’t wait to share more and keep building features up around Jekyll.</p>
<p>I’m writing a short e-book about everything I’ve learned, and I’ll have news soon about early access to the platform. You should <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the announce mailing list</a> before next week.</p>
