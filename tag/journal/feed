				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday you had lunch with friends or family and posted a photo of your food and location to Twitter. It didn&#8217;t matter much. You put it on Twitter and didn&#8217;t care that you didn&#8217;t <a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">have a copy</a> or didn&#8217;t post it to your own blog first, because controlling that trivial bit of content just didn&#8217;t seem important at the time.</p>
<p>5 years later, 10 years later, 15 years later. That lunch is magic now â€” a captured moment, something you wouldn&#8217;t remember and didn&#8217;t think to record elsewhere unless you keep a comprehensive private journal. Maybe it was the day before a significant event or on a trip. The true context is only revealed with hindsight.</p>
<p>I wrote this blog post because I wanted to follow up on <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/10/blogging-every-day.html">my post about blogging every day</a>, underscoring that seemingly unimportant events can carry great meaning later. Those common everyday activities that don&#8217;t seem noteworthy today? <em>That&#8217;s our life.</em> One after another, strung together for days and then years until we die. It&#8217;s the culture of the 21st century scattered among millions of micro posts. And it&#8217;ll be lost to time if we don&#8217;t curate it.</p>
<p>Yesterday was unremarkable only because we&#8217;re too close to it. Later we&#8217;ll understand that it meant everything. And if that&#8217;s true, let&#8217;s aspire to something greater than our content being sliced up and interspersed with ads on someone else&#8217;s platform.</p>
