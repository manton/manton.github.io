				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jury.me/blog/2013/3/30/mvp">Michael Jurewitz wrote a great post</a> last week on minimum viable products:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “As you look at your products and how you make them remember these key points. You don’t need all the features under the sun. You don’t need technical excellence (assuming you also avoid technical debt). You need to solve a worthwhile problem in a delightful, thoughtful, and simple way.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>What he’s saying is it’s okay to be limited, but make that limited part totally polished. Cutting back features doesn’t mean you also cut back on quality. It reminds me of <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Half_Not_Half_Assed.php">the quote from 37signals</a>: “build half a product, not a half-ass product”.</p>
<p>This is good advice that I need to take to heart. I don’t have much problem shipping. But my apps often have some rough edges at 1.0.</p>
<p>Also don’t miss Jurewitz’s great <a href="http://mjtsai.com/blog/2013/04/01/understanding-app-store-pricing/">5-part series on App Store pricing</a>. I’m linking to Michael Tsai’s summary here, since it provides nice quotes and links to each part in the series. I saw the talk that these blog posts were based on twice, at Çingleton and NSConference, and this has to be the best translation of a conference session into blog form I’ve ever seen. Not to be missed.</p>
