				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://carpeaqua.com/2012/08/20/a-therapeutic-killing/">Justin Williams on his decision to stop selling</a> his apps MarkdownMail and Today:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Financially, it may not have made much sense to cut off the revenue streams, but therapeutically I’m freeing up that portion of my brain to focus my full attention on the next version of Elements and the dozens of other ideas that that are circling in my head.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I felt exactly the same way <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/05/saying_goodbye_to.html">when I stopped selling Wii Transfer</a> earlier this year. It wasn’t until a month later that I realized how much I had been enjoying that revenue, limited as it had become. I don’t regret it, though. It was the right thing for my potential customers, not to be misled into thinking there would be new versions. And it was the right thing for my focus, working on other projects.</p>
