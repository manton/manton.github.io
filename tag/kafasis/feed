<blockquote><p>&#8220;I certainly feel like I&#8217;ve been talking about the iPhone a lot, particularly for a company that doesn&#8217;t currently have any iPhone software available. There are many reasons for that, but perhaps most important is that we believe the iPhone is a fantastically promising platform, and we don&#8217;t want to see that promise squandered.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In some ways it feels like nothing has changed since March when I &#8220;posted here about the iPhone NDA&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2008/03/iphone_sdk_and_ndas.html. I guess I&#8217;m disappointed that there hasn&#8217;t been more public conversation about building iPhone apps until now, but there&#8217;s definitely an attitude change just in the last few weeks &mdash; one in which fear of Apple&#8217;s lawyers is replaced with something closer to rebellion: posting sample code, blogging extensively, and abusing ad-hoc distribution. It&#8217;s right and healthy for developers to become as distrustful toward Apple as Apple has been hostile to developers.</p>
