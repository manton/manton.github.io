				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been conflicted about which iPad Pro to use ever since the 10-inch rumors started. If both sizes had been available right away, I think I would have bought the smaller version. Small is convenient; I still really like and use even the iPad Mini. But there was only one iPad Pro when the Apple Pencil was introduced, so I bought that one.</p>
<p>Luckily the 13-inch iPad Pro still has some nice benefits. More room for split-view apps, of course, but also 4 GB of RAM compared to the new iPad Pro’s 2 GB. <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-9-7-inch-ipad-pro-has-2-gb-of-ram/">Federico Viticci</a> is sticking with the big one:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  2 GB of RAM was one of the first things I heard about the new device yesterday, and part of the reason why <a href="https://www.macstories.net/roundups/the-9-7-inch-ipad-pro-our-complete-overview/">I’m going to stick with the 12.9-inch Pro</a>. In addition to a more comfortable iOS experience, I like knowing that I&#8217;m using the most powerful iPad hardware currently available (I don&#8217;t count the camera as essential to what I need to do on an iPad).
</p></blockquote>
<p>I realized this week that I was wasting time wondering which iPad is the best for me. It’s the ol&#8217; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice">paradox of choice</a>. So to cement the decision, I went by the Apple Store yesterday and picked up a Smart Keyboard for the 13-inch. I’ve been meaning to get one for months, and now that I have it, it makes even less sense to trade in my iPad for a different one. (The keyboard really does transform the iPad. It&#8217;s great.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jason Snell has posted <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/ipad-pro-new-tricks-for-old-dogs/">his initial thoughts on using the iPad Pro</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;What the past few days have taught me is that if I needed to switch from Mac to iPad, if I had a compelling reason, I could absolutely do it. I <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/">can edit podcasts</a>, write articles, edit spreadsheets, generate charts and graphs, edit photos, build web sites, transfer files via FTP, and more.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think Jason got an Apple Pencil or Smart Keyboard, although maybe he&#8217;ll have one of each in time for his full review. If you&#8217;ve enjoyed reading Six Colors as much as I have over the last year, <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">consider subscribing too</a>.</p>
