				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five years ago today, I joined Twitter as its 897th user, though for some reason &#8220;my first tweet&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/1457463 wasn&#8217;t until a few months later. So much has changed in the meantime &mdash; the API always in flux, the transition from primarily SMS, to web, to apps &mdash; but in many ways the core of the service remains intact and stronger than ever. Short messages, distributed efficiently to friends.</p>
<p>I talked about some of the good and bad of being a Twitter developer &#8220;on the ATX Web Show last week&#8221;:http://atxwebshow.com/2011/07/05/episode-34-tweet-library-with-manton/. There have been a string of changes that cause developers to scramble: turning off basic auth, discouraging mainstream clients, disabling DMs for xAuth. With each step, Twitter loses a little goodwill, and that&#8217;s demonstrated in the tweets I &#8220;collected over the xAuth change&#8221;:http://tweetlibrary.com/manton/xauthtooauth.</p>
<p>Even as Twitter passes 1 million registered apps, there&#8217;s a risk that some developers will stick with the platform as users only, putting their apps in maintenance mode. In May, &#8220;Kiwi developer Isaiah stopped development&#8221;:http://yourhead.tumblr.com/post/5550105265/i-love-you-kiwi-i-know of his Mac Twitter app:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just going to take a break from Kiwi for a while. It&#8217;s still for sale. I still support it. I&#8217;ll still fix bugs when they crop up. But adding new features and playing catch up with the other guys/gals is off the table.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe because I don&#8217;t have to depend on Tweet Library sales, I tend to more stubbornly ignore what is good business sense. There&#8217;s so much I still want to do. As &#8220;I wrote in my previous take&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/03/twitters.html on the state of the platform: &#8220;I&#8217;m a little discouraged, but not enough to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s doubly true today. More annoyed, but also more determined to plug holes in the platform, from archiving to syncing. I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about the developers who are building in &#8220;Tweet Marker&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/ support.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s always a chance, a feeling that something big is just around the corner. That if I don&#8217;t add that one feature, or open up that new API, I&#8217;ll miss the tipping point that makes Tweet Library really take off.</p>
