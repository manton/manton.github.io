				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/05/margaret-atwood-new-work-unseen-century-future-library">The Future Library project</a> will collect writing to be locked away and published for the first time in 100 years:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Each year, the Future Library trust, made up of literary experts – and Paterson, while she&#8217;s alive – will name another &#8216;outstanding&#8217; writer who will be contributing to the artwork. The trust is also responsible for the maintenance of the forest, and for ensuring the books are printed in a century&#8217;s time. A printing press will be placed in the library to make sure those in charge in 2114 have the capability of printing books on paper.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Love this idea. Although for a different goal, I think we need a similar set of trusts to maintain electronic publishing. Domain names and hosting are much more fragile than the paper Margaret Atwood will print her story on for this project.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t blog much about &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ in this space, but I should. When I joined the company, it was to return to designing and building Mac software, with the potential for working on something meaningful (education tools) as a refreshing bonus.</p>
<p>Over 5 years later, we have built up a great team and a mature set of products. Yesterday VitalSource announced it is being &#8220;acquired by Ingram Digital Ventures&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/index/news-app/story.35, which should be a good complement to the work we are doing. Ingram is the largest book wholesaler in the country, but I don&#8217;t think that fact really hit me until three days ago.</p>
<p>We were downtown with some time to kill before a performance. We stopped at the Farmers Market for some fresh peaches, flowers, and breakfast tacos. When we detoured to see if the library was open, I noticed these boxes outside and snapped a mobile phone picture.</p>
