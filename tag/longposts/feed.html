				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As 2012 was winding down, I was fascinated with LongPosts.com (built on top of App.net) and so used it to post some thoughts about Twitter archives. The site is gone now, so I&#8217;ve moved the text back to my weblog here, where it belongs anyway. The link to the ADN discussion <a href="https://alpha.app.net/manton/post/2143060">is here</a>. — future me, January 2016</em></p>
<p>One of the main goals of my web app Watermark is to archive and search tweets and ADN posts, so it was natural for me to implement support for Twitter&#8217;s new archive export format. I finished it last night and linked it from the Watermark account page this evening for all customers.</p>
<p>I had heard that Twitter&#8217;s export included a CSV version before I saw the actual files, so I started work coding an importer based on that, with the assumption that I could tweak it later. Once I saw a real tweets.zip, I had to throw out most of my initial work. The CSV files have two problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>They don&#8217;t properly escape values using quotes, so a comma inside a tweet makes the files more difficult to parse.</li>
<li>They don&#8217;t include some essential Twitter metadata like the reply-to ID.<br />
I switched to using the JSON files and it&#8217;s working well. They&#8217;re JavaScript but not strictly JSON, so you just skip the first line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the ZIP archive can be fairly big, instead of uploading in a web browser I let the user choose the file via Dropbox. This was a nice opportunity to try out the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/chooser">Dropbox Chooser</a>. Then on the server I extract the files and load the data.</p>
<p>Dave Winer is <a href="http://threads2.scripting.com/2012/december/uploadYourTwitterArchive">doing something interesting</a> with archives too. He&#8217;s started linking up other people&#8217;s archives on S3 — both the HTML view and the .zip file. I have a test Watermark account that I&#8217;ve loaded one of these into. It&#8217;s interesting to import multiple archives and have them all merged together and searchable.</p>
<p>For so long we&#8217;ve waited for access to our old tweets. In the meantime I&#8217;ve shipped two products around fixing this limitation, so it&#8217;s especially funny that Twitter finally rolls out archives <em>after I&#8217;ve stopped posting there</em>. (And of course I love that ADN has allowed access to your full post history from the very beginning.) Not entirely sure where all this is going to lead, but I agree with Dave Winer that new apps should be possible now.</p>
