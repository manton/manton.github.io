				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Saddington, who develops the Mac blog editor Desk, pointed to one of my recent posts <a href="http://blog.desk.pm/pt-indie/">and wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It does make me ponder, once again, what I’m doing with my so-called ‘career’ and if it’s the ‘right’ one. Although, every single time I think about that I know that I won’t like the answer… yet it always just works. I can’t tell you why or how I found or discovered this cadence, but, to each his own.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Which in turn makes me reflect on my own career. I’ve been extremely lucky. The right jobs just seemed to have presented themselves to me when I needed them. I hope that luck hasn’t led to overconfidence as I take these next steps to become more independent. It would be a glorious failure if my luck runs out just when I need it most.</p>
<p>So I’ll have to work harder. I’ll have to better manage my finances, better plan and execute on new products, and better support each app so they’ll form a sustainable business. As I type this, I’m actually a little nervous for the first time since I put in my notice. Lots to do.</p>
<p>Tonight’s challenge: finish integrating <a href="http://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> into my new app, to provide Markdown syntax highlighting. I had never heard of this JavaScript library before this week. It seems very capable — a big jump forward on a feature I didn’t even think I could provide for 1.0.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When <a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2014/10/noodlings-the_long_and_winding_road.html">Gus Mueller recently linked</a> to Paul Kim&#8217;s <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/blog/2014/08/29/the-long-and-winding-road/">post on being indie</a>, he called out the section on luck:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;One thing that I did learn is to have a healthy respect for randomness. Luck plays a huge role and you can’t always attribute one’s success or failure solely on their decisions and actions.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Reminds me of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118249755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1118249755&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mantonorg&amp;linkId=Q2MNQOANOEQSNRP2">Get Lucky</a> by Lane Becker and Thor Muller. Like half the business books I&#8217;ve bought, I never finished reading the whole thing, but it&#8217;s in the stack on my bedside table and I pick it up every once in a while and read something new. I love the book&#8217;s premise and they&#8217;ve got some great stories.</p>
<p>Most of life is a series of random opportunities. Knowing which ones to skip and which to double-down on makes all the difference.</p>
