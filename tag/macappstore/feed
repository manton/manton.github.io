				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I released <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart 1.5</a> for direct download customers and removed the previous version of Clipstart from the Mac App Store. Even though I&#8217;ve written about leaving the Mac App Store several times, actually pulling the trigger was difficult. But I believe it&#8217;s the right thing for my app, right now.</p>
<p>Clipstart 1.5 is still $29. Changes for this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Now requires Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. Please do not upgrade to this version if you are running 10.5 or 10.6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added &#8220;Consolidate&#8221; command for finding videos that have not been imported or duplicates outside the library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added AppleScript support for uploading videos. See the help menu for scripting examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved performance throughout the app, especially with importing and refreshing video thumbnails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved error message when failing to import all videos from a camera.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed tags field on Add Folder dialog not resetting tags value after an import.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion&#8217;s Gatekeeper security.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been thinking about buying Clipstart but were on the fence before, I&#8217;ll throw in a discount for you. Use coupon code MANTONBLOG to save 20%.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.c-had.com/history-repeats-itself/">Chad Sellers has a post</a> comparing Mac App Store sandboxing to mistakes from Linux, with this very reasonable advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I believe that Apple should have at least led the way by sandboxing all of their own apps sold through the Mac App Store (I believe they have not sandboxed a single one of their 17).&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of Twitter. When <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/collections/manton/xauthtooauth">Twitter forced third-party clients to move to OAuth</a>, but didn&#8217;t change their own app to use it, many developers said it was a double standard. Twitter&#8217;s response: the official Twitter app was part of the service, not really a separate app, so it didn&#8217;t need to use OAuth.</p>
<p>Maybe Apple could make the same case for Mac OS X&#8217;s built-in apps: Address Book, iCal, and Mail don&#8217;t need to be sandboxed because they are part of the operating system. But that argument doesn&#8217;t work for Keynote or iMovie. Those apps should play by the same rules that all productivity and video software in the store does.</p>
<p>If Apple were to sandbox a few of these it would go a long way toward convincing developers to do the same. And it would also shake out bugs and missing APIs in the whole sandbox environment.</p>
