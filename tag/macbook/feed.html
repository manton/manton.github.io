				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have no problems with USB-C on the new MacBook Pro. It will be a small headache at the beginning, for sure. But because it&#8217;s a standard there&#8217;s no long-term compatibility risk the way there is with removing the 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p>More on that below. First, Marco Arment <a href="https://marco.org/2016/11/02/design-for-the-present">doesn&#8217;t think using USB-C exclusively is very practical</a> in a pro laptop:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  A pro laptop released today should definitely have USB-C ports — <em>mostly</em> USB-C ports, even — but it should also have at least one USB-A port.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/11/02/design-for-the-future">John Gruber responds</a> that Apple&#8217;s strategy is to speed up adoption:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  They design for the future, and in doing so, they bring the future here faster. In the alternate universe where the new MacBook Pros ship with one USB-A port, the transition to ubiquitous USB-C peripherals and cables will happen at least a little slower.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with that. But then he closes with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m not saying Marco is wrong. I’m just saying Apple’s not wrong either. It’s the same trade-off with the iPhone 7 headphone jack.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the same at all. It&#8217;s a convenient narrative to group together both the migration away from USB-A and the one away from 3.5mm headphones. There are important differences, though.</p>
<p>USB-C is a standard that is already used in many devices from different vendors. It will become universal. The immediate replacement for the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7 is the Lightning EarPods which come in the box. Lightning is a proprietary cable that will never be used in non-Apple phones, and in fact is not even used on Macs.</p>
<p>You can argue that more and more people will use Bluetooth headphones, but I doubt they will be as common as wired headphones for many years, and there&#8217;s no guarantee that an all-wireless future will <em>ever</em> arrive. There is a very clear migration from USB-A to USB-C. The move to Lightning headphones and Bluetooth is much more complicated and not directly comparable.</p>

		<title>MacBook Air and Europe trip</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The MacBook Air is the first Apple product to come along in years that I don&#8217;t want to buy. It looks great, the multi-touch trackpad is cool and unexpected, and I like Remote Disk. But it&#8217;s just not significantly different than a MacBook to me, and I don&#8217;t travel enough to make the thinness or weight really matter. To &#8220;upgrade&#8221; from a regular MacBook to an Air just seems wasteful.</p>
<p>The &#8220;new Apple&#8221; has been doing a great job of eliminating duplicates in their product line (only one tower, only one of each size of iPod). If the Air had an 11-inch or 12-inch screen it would be a much easier sell because it becomes clear why the product exists: buy this if you want something small.</p>
<p>For two months in 1999, my wife and I travelled through Europe with only a backpack each and a PowerBook 520c to share between us. That machine was very small (just a 9.5-inch screen), yet she did contract work for Apple on it and I coded and released new versions of Mac software, dialed up to the net via modem from hotel rooms and hostels in the days before wi-fi. It was much heavier than an Air but for traveling light it was still a great choice.</p>
<p>It feels like Apple missed an opportunity at Macworld yesterday. I&#8217;m not particularly disappointed, though, since I wasn&#8217;t one of those hoping for a sub-notebook.</p>
