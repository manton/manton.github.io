				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2008/maclife.png" alt="MacLife" border="0" width="200" height="256" hspace="10" align="left" style="border: solid 1px lightgray;" /> Wii Transfer has a full-page mini-tutorial in the May edition of &#8220;MacLife magazine&#8221;:http://www.maclife.com/, as part of a section on connecting your Mac to video game consoles. I finally &#8220;picked up a copy&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/792260641 last night. It was certainly a nice surprise and seems to have brought a small increase in sales.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been wrapping up the next version of Wii Transfer, which hopefully smoothes over most of the rough spots in the current release. After sending beta copies to a few customers, I&#8217;m opening up a &#8220;new forums section&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/forums/ as an experiment in getting early builds out without a more formal public beta. (It&#8217;s not linked from the main site yet, but will be soon.) Every developer handles betas in a different way, but I like the balance Jesse at &#8220;Hog Bay Software&#8221;:http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/ has achieved between his released software page and the early builds and developer notes in the forums section, for those customers willing to dig a little bit below the surface.</p>
