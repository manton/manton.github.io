				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Moren had <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3115792/ios/hey-apple-it-s-time-to-rethink-icloud.html">an article at Macworld last week</a> about the price for iCloud storage. Most iPhone users quickly run out of space for a backup, but they don&#8217;t use iTunes either because iCloud is just much simpler:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Apple’s philosophy is about making its products seamless and easy to use. Encouraging people to use iCloud backup is, in most cases, smoother and simpler than having to back-up to a computer.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTrO2wUxh0Q">5 years ago</a> that Steve Jobs introduced iCloud and talked about demoting the computer from the central hub:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Keeping these devices in sync is driving us crazy. So, we&#8217;ve got a great solution for this problem. And we think this solution is our next big insight, which is we&#8217;re going to demote the PC and the Mac to just be a device. Just like an iPhone, an iPad, or an iPod Touch. And we&#8217;re going to move the digital hub — the center of your digital life — into the cloud.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I use iCloud backup exclusively, with only the occasional manual iTunes backup when I know I&#8217;m going to immediately restore from it, such as when upgrading to a new iPhone. I expect most new iPhone users rarely sync with iTunes, relegating iTunes to a playback app for their iTunes rentals and Apple Music subscription, but not much else.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s certainly the case for my family, at least. After some lost photos recently, I told the kids I would bump their allowance by $1 to cover everyone having at least 50 GB of iCloud storage. No more excuses.</p>
<p>Maybe it should be free, as Dan Moren argues above. Or maybe Apple could encourage upgrades by bundling extra iCloud storage with Apple Music and other popular services. But even today, at 99 cents, it&#8217;s a small price to pay for cloud backup that you never have to think about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I let myself go off into a bit of a Swift rant on <a href="http://coreint.org/232">the latest Core Intuition</a>. I’ve been doing a lot of Swift development recently. The more I use it, the more conflicted I am. I really love some parts of the language, but it’s not what I would have asked for as a successor to Objective-C 2.0.</p>
<p>Remember when Steve Jobs came back to Apple and compared NeXTSTEP to constructing a building by starting out on the 20th floor, with so much of the foundation and common patterns already taken care of for you? Cocoa allowed apps to be built significantly faster than before. Steve said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QrX047-v-s">at Macworld Expo in 1997</a> that the goal was to &#8220;eliminate 80% of the code that every developer has to write for their app.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swift is not like that. Swift’s priorities are correctness and stability. These have more indirect benefits to developer productivity than we saw going from Carbon to Cocoa.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://marco.org/2016/04/21/brent-performance">Marco Arment wrote about Swift</a> last month, he mentioned wanting a language designed for high-level apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Objective-C wasn’t much better for this, but I think we could’ve done better than Swift if the most important goal in Swift was maximizing real-world developer productivity when writing modern Mac and iOS apps. Swift does a little of that, but gives up a lot to also serve lower-level, more clever, language-geekier goals.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This weekend, <a href="http://inessential.com/2016/05/14/the_tension_of_swift">Brent Simmons has a new post</a> about the loss of dynamic features in “pure” Swift:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What makes me nervous is Swift’s emphasis on type safety and on compile-time resolution. As long as we also have what we need from Objective-C, then that’s fine — then we still get xibs and storyboards, the Responder Chain, and so on.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope Brent’s right that this will be a core part of Swift 4. Leaning on the Objective-C runtime feels like a temporary solution because it only exists on the Mac and iOS. Great web frameworks like Ruby on Rails, for example, can’t be built without relying on a more dynamic language. (And to me a great promise for Swift is being able to use it everywhere.)</p>
<p><a href="http://indiestack.com/2016/05/brents-swift-tension/">Daniel Jalkut followed up</a> with a more optimistic post. He thinks Apple is on top of this, even as he acknowledges the clash between existing frameworks and the new language:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Some major design priorities of the Swift language, namely type safety and compile time dependency binding, are at odds with the design priorities of 20 years of evolution in Apple’s frameworks. How and if that disparity will be reckoned by Apple remains to be seen.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think it’s telling that the “dynamic” keyword isn’t even mentioned in the main language guide. Anything related to Objective-C is off in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithObjective-CAPIs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH4-ID35">separate set of documentation</a>, which includes discouraging statements such as “Requiring dynamic dispatch is rarely necessary” and “use of the performSelector APIs is discouraged”. For Swift to thrive in the future, as a great language for newcomers and long-time Mac developers, Apple will have to compromise on that mindset.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was Macworld Expo in 1997, and Steve Jobs had just come back to Apple. Somehow I was lucky enough to get a seat in the keynote, and I sat there with a big grin on my face as Steve came out to talk about NeXTSTEP, which would eventually become the foundation for Mac OS X. He likened developing an app to constructing a building, one level at a time. A good OS allowed you to build higher.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s DOS gave you very little, so you had to start at the ground floor. Developing for the Mac and Windows was like starting out on a 5-story building. But the developer tools from NeXT were like starting out on the 20th floor, because they were so advanced, because they “lifted the developer up” and let apps be developed more quickly than if you had to deal with all the basic foundational stuff every app needs.</p>
<p>I think the App.net API is that same kind of advancement for apps compared to most other web APIs. It is significantly more consistent and full-featured than anything else out there.</p>
<p><a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> syncs stories and photos with App.net, using your App.net private file storage (for storing photo data) as well as private channels and messages (for syncing story titles, permissions, and other metadata). We like this solution because everyone who signs in to the app with their App.net credentials gets sync automatically. It also means that if you authorize other apps to see your App.net files, you can manage the data Sunlit syncs there, or get it out again without us having to directly build an export feature.</p>
<p>(Although we do offer a number of export choices in Sunlit, such as saving photos to your camera roll, sharing them on social networks, or sending them to any app that supports “Open In”. We do this <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/01/20/sharing-about-overshare/">with OvershareKit</a>.)</p>
<p>Publishing in Sunlit is another feature that utilizes App.net file storage. It allows you to take a story — photos and text — and publish it to a URL. The URL is public, but it’s not linked from anywhere unless you directly share the URL with someone. This makes it convenient for quickly publishing a set of photos and sending the link to family, for example.</p>
<p>Here’s what the published stories currently look like: <a href="http://sunlit.io/manton/nationalparks">http://sunlit.io/manton/nationalparks</a></p>
<p>On the surface this may look like Sunlit is uploading photos and other data to sunlit.io, where it’s probably stored in a relational database or on the server filesystem somewhere. But that’s not how it works at all.</p>
<p>The iPhone app actually uploads all photos to App.net file storage, marks the new files public, then generates a static HTML page and also uploads <em>that</em> to App.net. It then registers the story with sunlit.io, which caches the HTML just to make things a little faster. We never store any photos on sunlit.io itself, instead merely referencing their public URLs on App.net. (View source on the page to see the proof.)</p>
<p>This difference means you can move the site anywhere just by copying files from App.net, with any number of available <a href="https://directory.app.net/">file management tools</a>. Or just copy the HTML file to your own server to serve the page from your own domain. The CSS and JavaScript is all bundled inline in the HTML, except jQuery, which loads from a URL.</p>
<p>We think this approach makes the whole system a lot more flexible and open. Your data is never hidden inside the app and your published pages are never locked behind a server.</p>
<p>Several months ago <a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/08/waiting_for_appnets.html">I wrote this about App.net</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The promise of App.net is bigger than one type of app. App.net isn’t just a blank slate; it’s an amplifier. It’s waiting to power the next new idea and help it grow into something big.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I still believe that. It’s making apps easier to build and more powerful, just like NeXTSTEP was. There’s really no other web platform like it. That’s why we picked it for Sunlit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://natebarham.com/post/53767446736/layered-glass-the-nothing-ui">Nate Barham describes iOS 7</a> as layered glass:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The best developers will see iOS as an operational model, not a visual one. Imagine a Tapbots app that, instead of removing the cute ‘I’m a twitter robot in your phone!’ aesthetic, doubles down on it. Zooming metal plates, ratcheting gears not shadowed from without but appearing from within the device, only now it isn’t a robot-esque layer over the stock controls, the UI becomes the character that the developer envisions—even more so than it has ever done before.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I really like this post, but I’m not totally sold on the paragraph quoted above. Done right, it could be brilliant. But this is a very difficult thing to pull off, keeping the playful spirit of Tweetbot with a lighter, minimalist iOS 7 UI.</p>
<p>And related, if you missed <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2043265/why-ios-7s-design-is-bold-but-flawed.html">Christa Mrgan’s recent Macworld essay</a>, she also covers how iOS 7 will use depth and motion to switch from “faux 3D to real 2.5D”, with an example from Adobe’s After Effects. Makes me wonder if designers will need new prototyping tools.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There were a couple special essays on Macworld recently — guest posts from the developer community. <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2031592/apple-fans-microsoft-is-no-longer-the-enemy.html">First Brent Simmons</a>, who argues that Microsoft isn’t the enemy anymore:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The threat to Macintosh was not that Windows machines were cheaper, or that people had bad taste—the biggest reason was that they worked with everything. That was why Apple asked Microsoft in 1997 to continue developing Office for Macs, so we could at least say you could run Word and Excel on Macs. […] But, these days, <em>everything</em> works with everything.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2033728/apple-unfortunately-no-longer-the-underdog.html">followed by Cabel Sasser</a>, with a similar theme:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I sometimes very awkwardly find myself rooting for Microsoft, Nokia—anybody—to put up a good fight and keep that fire burning under Apple’s collective behind. The smartest, most incredible people work in Cupertino, and their capabilities are boundless and their drive is endless, but sometimes—especially as a developer—you get the feeling that Apple doesn’t really need you, and will do just fine without you, thank you very much. I want Apple to need us.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Both great essays.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2031816/hotline-revisited.html">Benj Edwards writes a Hotline retrospective</a> for Macworld:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The Hotline system consists of three parts: servers, clients, and trackers. Anyone with an Internet connection can host a Hotline server for free; it’s software that provides for multi-user chat, message boards, and file transfers. Clients are special programs users run to connect to Hotline servers. And trackers are special servers that exist to facilitate connections between clients and servers; they keep an active list of available Hotline servers that wish to be listed on the tracker.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I remember Hotline. I was building web sites by then, but it still had obvious appeal reminiscent of the earlier BBS and AOL/eWorld days. This article from Macworld is important because it will serve as a sort of Hotline software “about page” for future internet searchers. For many apps that were popular in the 1990s, it’s now very difficult to find an online record that they even existed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been over a year since I launched <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker</a>, and I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what its second year will look like. Hosting costs have gone up significantly over the last year, though I’ve offset that by combining the hosting for <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a> and Tweet Marker together so that they share the same core servers. I’ve considered other options, too: run a Kickstarter-like fundraiser, charge developers, or ask for donations again.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve stopped posting to Twitter from my personal account, people also ask whether I’ll just shut Tweet Marker down. The answer is no. I’ll keep it running, even if it means funneling some revenue from Tweet Library and Watermark to pay for it. Even if it means having to put out fires and deal with other web hosting distractions.</p>
<p>Hosted web services have a different level of commitment than traditional apps. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/05/saying_goodbye_to.html">When I stopped selling Wii Transfer</a>, existing customers could continue to use it for as long as they wanted. Not so with something like Tweet Marker, which becomes useless the minute I shutter the web server.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/manton/status/152902526566543360/photo/1">The Macworld Eddy statue</a> sits on my desk as a constant reminder that real people like this thing and find it useful. There is a lot of uncertainty with Twitter, App.net, Tent.io, and the future of microblogging, but no matter what takes off and what sync looks like, I think Tweet Marker played an important role in the evolution of Twitter clients. I’ll always be proud of that. It would be a disservice to my customers and the Macworld award to ever consider turning off the API while people value it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few times since it launched, I&#8217;ve said to friends that Tweet Marker may be the best thing I&#8217;ve done. It has reached more users than any of my indie Mac and iOS apps, and it has been especially rewarding to work with other Twitter developers. It&#8217;s not perfect yet &mdash; there&#8217;s more to improve in future versions of the API and clients &mdash; but I smile every time I see a tweet about how someone can&#8217;t imagine going back to a Twitter client without it.</p>
<p>So it was really gratifying to see &#8220;Macworld recognize Tweet Marker with an Editors&#8217; Choice Award&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/163951/2011/12/the_27th_annual_editors_choice_awards.html for 2011. Thank you Macworld for seeing Tweet Marker as an important part of the Twitter experience.</p>
<p>And thanks to &#8220;all the Twitter app developers&#8221;:http://twitter.com/#!/manton/status/143729811406331905 who have supported Tweet Marker in their apps. We are up to 9 supporting apps across 5 platforms &mdash; Mac, iPhone, iPad, Chrome, and Android &mdash; with more on the way. I&#8217;ve opened up the API to over 40 different clients in various stages of research or testing.</p>
<p>Tweet Marker is a little unique among most of the other Eddy winners this year in that it&#8217;s still completely free. I won&#8217;t see a sales spike following the announcement. If you&#8217;ve been enjoying the service, consider picking up a copy of my iPad app Tweet Library, or donating directly &#8220;on the site&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I &#8220;wrote in January&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/01/macworld_expo_2010.html, I decided to go to Macworld to show off Clipstart and Wii Transfer, and to experience the conference again and hang out with friends. I ended up doing less of the latter, because I lost my voice and was feeling terrible for a couple days, but nevertheless the trip was great and I&#8217;m very glad I went. Worth it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my summary of the show, what it took for me to be there and what I got out of it for &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/. This is supposed to be in the spirit of &#8220;Rogue Amoeba&#8217;s excellent series on Macworld&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2007/01/16/should-i-exhibit-at-macworld-part-1-costs/, but more from a super-tiny company perspective, and just where my experience differs.</p>
<p>I do want to quickly mention costs, since that&#8217;s the primary consideration when planning these things. I took advantage of the Indie Developer Spotlight shared kiosk to keep investment low. In fact, I wouldn&#8217;t have gone otherwise. I kept the whole trip to about $2700, with a rough breakdown like:</p>
<p>$1250 &#8211; space on the show floor</p>
<p>$900 &#8211; hotel for 4 nights</p>
<p>$250 &#8211; flights to and from San Francisco</p>
<p>$100 &#8211; printed &#8220;2000 flyers&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/4326331440/</p>
<p>$200 &#8211; other misc costs, cabs, and food</p>
<p>I could have saved some money in there on the hotel, but in general I think I did pretty well. For a lot indies it&#8217;s probably not that much different than a WWDC trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/4425406126/in/set-72157623476367967/"><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2010/flyers_ollie.png" alt="flyers_ollie.png" title="flyers_ollie.png" border="0" width="200" height="138" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /></a> I worked 8 hours each day on my feet at Moscone North, in my little booth space in the very corner of the expo. I was lucky for two things: Guy English was awesome and covered for me a couple times so I could take a real break; and the restrooms and water fountain were so close I could slip away when traffic was slow and be back without missing much.</p>
<p>The less expensive booth option was supposed to be for a table shared between 3 developers, with presumably a dozen or more small companies filling the area. But unlike the iPhone pavilion in the center of the tradeshow, which was packed with exhibitors, hardly any Mac developers took advantage of this offer. It was just me and one other company.</p>
<p>This was disappointing at first, since a less dense area doesn&#8217;t convey the same excitement and means less foot traffic. But there were other aspects of the deal that turned out better than expected, such as included wired internet even though none was originally promised. Compared to a traditional booth, it was a bargain.</p>
<p>Before leaving Austin for San Francisco I jotted down a few notes on how I could measure success, since I didn&#8217;t want to pin whether it was worth it just to direct sales.</p>
<p><em>See friends and meet new people.</em> Check, but there were a lot of people that I ran into very briefly and didn&#8217;t get to really talk to. See aforementioned lost voice.</p>
<p><em>Get ideas from customers.</em> Check, got plenty of great ideas. I loved talking to random Mac people, not limited to just the ones who bother to send email.</p>
<p><em>Figure out how to sell the product.</em> There&#8217;s nothing like explaining your application over and over again all day to refine your pitch. I feel like I have a much better handle on this, but there&#8217;s still work to do, and web sites to update.</p>
<p><em>Actually sell some copies.</em> I used a coupon code to track sales. During the conference my sales were flat, but in the weeks since I&#8217;ve had the best sales days of Clipstart ever.</p>
<p><em>Get exposure in the press.</em> Check, was interviewed by Ryan Ritchey for &#8220;The Digital Lifestyle&#8221;:http://thedigitallifestyle.tv/home/2010/2/12/wii-transfer-at-macworld-2010.html, Merlin Mann for &#8220;MacBreak Video&#8221;:http://www.pixelcorps.tv/macbreak301, and talked with other members of the press on the show floor. I should have done more but lacked the energy.</p>
<p><em>Win best of show award.</em> Nope, but wasn&#8217;t expecting it. I think it&#8217;s a shame that only one Mac application won, but on the flip side it&#8217;s great that it was &#8220;Inklet&#8221;:http://tenonedesign.com/inklet.php. Really cool app.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s expectations coming into the event were low &mdash; the previous exhibitors who backed out, the attendees who wrote Macworld off, and the press who questioned the show&#8217;s relevance. But clearly Macworld 2010 was a success. The second day of the expo I was late to the show floor, arriving just a few minutes before they opened the hall. There was a huge mass of people waiting to get in.</p>
<p>There will be a Macworld 2011. I&#8217;m really excited to see how it works to move the whole expo and conference to Moscone West. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll be there yet, since as demonstrated this year I can&#8217;t plan nearly that far in advance. Throwing all of this together 2 weeks before the show only worked because of everyone who made things a little easier during the week.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jason Snell, Merlin Mann, Adam Lisagor, and everyone else who stopped by and waited patiently through my demos; also Guy English, Paul Kafasis, David Barnard, John Fox, John Chaffee, the RogueSheep guys, my booth buddies from &#8220;Hello Chair&#8221;:http://hellochair.com/appsaurus/, and the other indie developers I&#8217;m forgetting; and especially Albert McMurry, Dan Moren, and John Gruber for telling people about Clipstart. It succeeds only because of word of mouth.</p>
<p>In closing&#8230; Maybe it&#8217;s because James Cameron is still in the news, but I&#8217;ve always loved this line from the character Rose in Titanic: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make any sense. That&#8217;s why I trust it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s mostly how I felt about exhibiting at Macworld. Even though it was &#8220;cheap&#8221; by tradeshow standards, for me it was real money and a risk. I booked my flight the day I realized that the only reason not to go was because I could fail.</p>
