I finally &#8220;picked up a copy&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/792260641 last night. It was certainly a nice surprise and seems to have brought a small increase in sales.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been wrapping up the next version of Wii Transfer, which hopefully smoothes over most of the rough spots in the current release. After sending beta copies to a few customers, I&#8217;m opening up a &#8220;new forums section&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/forums/ as an experiment in getting early builds out without a more formal public beta. (It&#8217;s not linked from the main site yet, but will be soon.) Every developer handles betas in a different way, but I like the balance Jesse at &#8220;Hog Bay Software&#8221;:http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/ has achieved between his released software page and the early builds and developer notes in the forums section, for those customers willing to dig a little bit below the surface.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I received two great surprises this week. In the mail came the 9th issue of &#8220;Animation Blast&#8221;:http://www.animationblast.com/, Amid Amidi&#8217;s magazine on the art and history of animation artists. This started as a smaller quarterly magazine, but the latest issue has grown to over 100 pages. It&#8217;s an extremely high quality, ad-free book. I think I placed an order for Animation Blast #9 <em>over 3 years ago</em>, and it was continually delayed due to Amid&#8217;s other responsibilities. No worries, though, because the book is beautiful.</p>
<p>The other related surprise was a new episode of the &#8220;Animation Podcast&#8221;:http://www.animationpodcast.com/. The last one was over 2 months ago, but again, the quality is so high and the information so valuable that it makes my day when a new one drops into iTunes. The 17 episodes so far, if taken together, represent a huge wealth of animation history, rivaling most DVDs and books in my collection. They are probably the only podcasts I subscribe to that I would archive to audio CDs to make sure I always have access to them.</p>
