				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw The Illusionist when it came out a couple months ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. &#8220;I love magic&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2005/02/the_great_scott.html. The film was well told, the ending a surprise for me. Edward Norton was really good in it too. I re-watched Fight Club a week later, for the first time since the theatrical release.</p>
<p>Last night, I saw &#8220;The Prestige&#8221;:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/. How lucky are we to have two movies about magicians in the same year? The Illusionist was really good, but The Prestige sidesteps direct comparison and just creates a new league for itself. My head was still buzzing an hour after the film was over, unraveling the different layers of the film, what it all meant for the characters and their actions. It was one of those rare works that inspires, both from the flawless filmmaking and the dedication of the fictional characters as well. I was literally on the edge of my seat and completely captivated.</p>
<p>Even as the credits started to roll I wanted to see it again. It&#8217;s that good.</p>
