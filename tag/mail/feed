				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have used Yahoo for almost a decade. It wasn&#8217;t long ago that I pointed to Yahoo and Google as great successes &#8212; sites based on the idea that a simple, functional interface is what users want rather than some fancy Flash application or graphics-heavy site.</p>
<p>But as of today I will avoid yahoo.com like the plague.</p>
<p>Late yesterday I logged into Yahoo Mail and almost dropped to the floor in shock. Instead of seeing my email, a message stared back at me stating that I had not logged in for at least 4 months. My account was disabled and <b>all my mail was deleted</b>! Unbelievable. I regularly log into other sections of Yahoo (the calendar, for example), and it never occurred to me that they would pull something like this on their customers.</p>
<p>Reading over the <a href="http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/">Terms of Service</a>, all I could find was a vague statement that Yahoo &#8220;reserves the right to log off accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time.&#8221; First of all, my account was not inactive, since I regularly log in with my Yahoo ID and do other non-email things, and secondly, I hardly consider 4 months an &#8220;extended&#8221; period of time. I usually use Yahoo Mail when out of town, so it might be months between trips without my PowerBook.</p>
<p>So why do I care? While traveling in Europe a few years ago, I used Yahoo Mail frequently, at Internet cafes, hotels, and hostels. Much of my communication with people back home went through Yahoo&#8217;s servers. It&#8217;s all gone now.</p>
<p>(Yes, I should have gotten the important stuff off of Yahoo Mail before now, but they don&#8217;t make that easy.)</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that someone working at Yahoo is reading this, hook me up with someone in the data center that can pull backups for me. I need that email back!</p>
