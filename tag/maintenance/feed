				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jason Snell closed <a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2016/06/app-store-uncertainty/">his first take on App Store subscriptions</a> with a question about iPhone app maintenance vs. web services maintenance:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Whether Apple would actually reject a subscription-based app that doesn’t offer any functionality outside of itself, I don’t know. It sure wouldn’t be the first time there was a baffling App Store rejection. But does Apple really want to take the position that ongoing maintenance of a web service has value, but ongoing maintenance and development of an app does not? I don’t think it does.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I wrote about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/06/core-intuition-236-and-app-subscriptions.html">in my post yesterday</a>, users can more easily see the hosting costs for a web service. They&#8217;ve been trained by a decade of paying for web subscriptions. Maintenance for the app itself has some differences.</p>
<p>Think about how costs scale if an app becomes popular. A web service becomes expensive to run, often thousands of dollars each month. You could say that a developer&#8217;s time for app maintenance is <em>also</em> thousands of dollars, but it&#8217;s essentially fixed. Outside of customer support costs, the incremental cost to a developer for an app doesn&#8217;t increase in the same way it does for scaling a backend service.</p>
<p>I hate that Apple has the power to reject our business model for a potential app. I&#8217;m now leaning more to the idea that Apple should approve nearly everything and let customers decide on the value. But there <em>is</em> a difference between maintenance of an app vs. a web service, and the services that are clearly appropriate for subscriptions will be the most successful apps using this new model.</p>
