<p>iOS already ships with a mapping framework from Apple that all apps can use, so why did we ignore it in <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> and use <a href="http://mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> instead? Two main reasons:</p>
<p><strong>Custom map colors.</strong> I was interested in creating beautiful new maps that would give Sunlit a unique design. Maps in every other iOS app look exactly the same. Sunlit is automatically more distinctive just by choosing something different, and we barely scratched the surface of the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/woodcut-inspired-map/">customization that is possible on Mapbox</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Direct web API.</strong> Mapbox gives you access to your maps not just in a native iOS map view, but also over the web. For the story backgrounds in Sunlit, we grab rendered maps directly with an HTTP call. This is a lot simpler and faster than having to build an interactive map view and snapshot it.</p>
<p>It also helped that I’ve been following the cool stuff Mapbox has been doing ever since <a href="http://codesorcery.net/2011/03/04/working-with-development-seed">Justin Miller joined their team</a> a few years ago. I could tell this was a company that wanted to push the technology of maps forward. Apple needs to spend all their time building a viable alternative to Google Maps — driving directions, business locations, better search. But I don’t care about any of those things in my app. For Sunlit I want to use a framework from people who clearly love maps, and I think that’s Mapbox.</p>
