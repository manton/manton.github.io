				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few of years ago we took a vacation to New York City and Montreal. We were taking the subway so often, I switched to Google Maps for its transit directions. I&#8217;ve been using Google Maps exclusively ever since.</p>
<p>Until now, there were very few reasons to go back to Apple Maps. Apple has been playing catch-up. <a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/complex-decisions.html">Why use a product</a> that is only adding features from a competitor, but not anything new?</p>
<p>This week Apple rolled out a unique feature that&#8217;s interesting to me: ChargePoint integration to find charging locations for electric cars. Ryan Christoffel covers it <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/apple-maps-adds-chargepoint-integration/">at MacStories</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Having spent several years building partnerships to ensure its data won&#8217;t lead any drivers astray, Apple has more recently been able to focus on integrating data that&#8217;s less important, but still quite useful. A few months ago we saw the company <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/parkopedia-and-apple-strike-maps-deal/">team up with Parkopedia</a> to improve parking data, and now charging stations are a natural next step.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I rarely need this — and the ChargePoint app itself has more detail, such as how many spots are actually available — but I&#8217;m excited about it as a new feature. I hope that it represents a fundamental improvement across the maps platform. I&#8217;m putting Apple Maps back on my home screen for a while.</p>

<p>iOS already ships with a mapping framework from Apple that all apps can use, so why did we ignore it in <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> and use <a href="http://mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> instead? Two main reasons:</p>
<p><strong>Custom map colors.</strong> I was interested in creating beautiful new maps that would give Sunlit a unique design. Maps in every other iOS app look exactly the same. Sunlit is automatically more distinctive just by choosing something different, and we barely scratched the surface of the <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/woodcut-inspired-map/">customization that is possible on Mapbox</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Direct web API.</strong> Mapbox gives you access to your maps not just in a native iOS map view, but also over the web. For the story backgrounds in Sunlit, we grab rendered maps directly with an HTTP call. This is a lot simpler and faster than having to build an interactive map view and snapshot it.</p>
<p>It also helped that I’ve been following the cool stuff Mapbox has been doing ever since <a href="http://codesorcery.net/2011/03/04/working-with-development-seed">Justin Miller joined their team</a> a few years ago. I could tell this was a company that wanted to push the technology of maps forward. Apple needs to spend all their time building a viable alternative to Google Maps — driving directions, business locations, better search. But I don’t care about any of those things in my app. For Sunlit I want to use a framework from people who clearly love maps, and I think that’s Mapbox.</p>
