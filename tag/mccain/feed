				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>I made a comment on &#8220;Dave Winer&#8217;s points&#8221;:http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/08/29/initialThoughtsOnThePalinN.html about McCain VP pick Sarah Palin that I feel like I should republish here. I&#8217;ve commented on dozens of blogs and news sites through the primaries, but I haven&#8217;t posted here on this blog, instead preferring to let off steam on Twitter. I think this comment serves as a nice snapshot in time of the race, at least from my perspective, so here it is:</i></p>
<p>Some of your points may end up being true, but let me just address number 6. Since you didn&#8217;t vote for Hillary, there are 18 million people who know more about this point than you do.</p>
<p>Every day this week at the convention, the main news story was Hillary and party unity. What would she say, would Democrats unite? Well she hit it out of the park with her speech, and Bill Clinton did too, and then Biden followed strong and it was easy to be excited about being a Democrat, about the story of Obama and Biden and how hopelessly lost the Republicans were by comparison. Even those Democrats who were frustrated with the party, and disappointed with Obama in general, started to warm up to the ticket.</p>
<p>When McCain picked Palin, it was like none of the week had happened. Everything was reset back to the primaries, in how Hillary had been treated by the press, party, and Obama supporters, and how Obama had passed her over for VP.</p>
<p>On the issues, Palin is no Hillary. But every day for the next 2 months, Palin will be a reminder to disgruntled Democrats that Obama messed up.</p>
