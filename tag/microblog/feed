				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jussi Pekonen has <a href="http://pekonen.cc/blog/2015/11/09/Relaunching-old-launching-new-and-reactivating-a-dormant-account.html">relaunched his weblog</a>, with a new focus on microblogging:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I want to own <em>all content</em> I produce. That way I can ensure that everything I write does not go the way of the dodo when the latest and coolest microblogging platform goes belly up.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>He calls the short posts &#8220;blips&#8221;. I call mine <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">snippets</a>, which I borrowed from <a href="http://noahread.net/snippets">Noah Read</a>. I like both names, but even more importantly, I like Jussi&#8217;s approach to owning his own content and providing a simple RSS feed of microblog posts. (I wrote more about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">RSS and microblogs</a> a couple weeks ago.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Derek Sivers <a href="https://sivers.org/nowff">had a great idea</a>. We&#8217;re constantly writing about the things we care about and whatever we&#8217;re working on, but the nature of blogs is that posts are always falling off the home page. There&#8217;s rarely a single place to get the tl;dr summary of what someone is working on.</p>
<p>This idea hit home for me last week at Release Notes when several people asked how to sign up on <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">my microblog project announcement list</a>. I&#8217;ve linked to it several times in blog posts, but I didn&#8217;t have an easy place to point people to without asking them to dig through the archives. A /now page is the perfect place for that kind of thing.</p>
<p>Shawn Blanc <a href="https://shawnblanc.net/now">linked to his page</a> too, which reminded me to put my own /now page together. You can read mine here: <a href="http://www.manton.org/now">manton.org/now</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">writing about my WordPress-based microblog</a> and linking to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/more-quick-blogging-workflows.html">similar solutions from Seth Clifford and Ben Brooks</a>, I’ve been hearing from more bloggers about their interesting microblog workflows. Everyone has a slightly different spin on the basic idea, but all of them achieve some independence from Twitter by having the primary copy of each post live on their own site.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://alpha.app.net/chasemccoy/post/61446625">Chase McCoy mentions on App.net</a> that he uses Launch Center Pro for quick microblogging of links:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “To make a post all I have to do is copy a link, and then run a Launch Center Pro action that prompts me for the text of the post. One click and it&#8217;s done!”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, <a href="http://vandragt.com/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress-and-twitter">Sander van Dragt describes</a> his WordPress setup. It’s similar to mine, but his post includes more detail. He also links to a comment on <a href="https://gist.github.com/manton/f8b6f8b391a2f3d9b419#comment-1480486">my .htaccess gist</a> with a better explanation and rewrite rules.</p>
<p>Next up, <a href="http://adamsimpson.net/writing/microblogging">Adam Simpson shares</a> how he posts to his own microblog directly from an SMS. He even goes one step further, integrating tweet features directly back into WordPress:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I save the tweet ID of every post that gets posted to Twitter. I use that ID to pull in the favorite and retweet counts and display them next to each ‘note’ in the WordPress dashboard.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, here’s <a href="https://alpha.app.net/mrhenko/post/61441031#61435778">an AppleScript solution on App.net from Henrik Carlsson</a> that allows him to take any text on his Mac and quickly post it to his microblog via an Automator workflow. Pretty great. I had forgotten that AppleScript has native XML-RPC support, which most blogging systems support.</p>
<p>I’m inspired by all the cool work people are doing around blogs. It’s a good time to write on the web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All my short, microblog-style posts go to my own weblog first, and also get cross-posted manually to App.net. You can view them in <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">a special category</a> and RSS feed.</p>
<p>I think owning your own posts on the internet — even if they seem unimportant and fleeting — is a valuable contribution to the health of the open web. By loosely following <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">some simple conventions</a>, we can build stuff that goes beyond what purely centralized web apps like Twitter are capable of.</p>
<p>Getting started is easy. I recommend one of 3 approaches right now if you want to play in this emerging ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>. Microblog posts don’t need titles, and Tumblr has never cared much for titles itself. Some of Tumblr’s post types fit the style of a microblog very well. They also provide custom domain mapping, so that if you want to move your site later you can do it without breaking links.</li>
<li><a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a>. The latest version of Dave Winer’s tool can cross-post to Twitter. The setup couldn’t be easier, and because it has it’s own RSS feed, it will be easy to plug into future apps or get your data out.</li>
<li><a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>. I use the self-hosted version of this. Just give microblog posts the “status” post type, which many WordPress themes can render with a tweet-like style. If you also put these posts in a special category, you can provide RSS feeds just for certain post types, or filter them out of your main feed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since last year I’ve been working on something new that is all about microblogging. I hope that it will encourage many more microblogs, but there’s no reason to wait until then. You can start a microblog today with one of the above apps (or dozens of other blogging solutions), and more fully control your own presence on the web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Matt Mullenweg on <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/10/streak/">being challenged to blog every day</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I thought blogging every day would be a burden, but it actually became a great source of joy. It was more a shift in mindset than anything — every day I read things I think are interesting, share links with friends, have thoughts that are 80% of a blog post, and write a ton privately, it was just a matter of catching those moments and turning them into something that was shared with the world.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Whenever I get out of the habit of writing daily, it creates friction to get anything published. When you post every day, there&#8217;s no expectation that all posts have to be great. But when you wait too long, there&#8217;s an increasing feeling that the next post has to be perfect.</p>
<p>Tools that make writing effortless — like Twitter&#8217;s limited, fast UI — should be part of the next generation of blogging software. I think that&#8217;s going to be around microblogs. Just because traditional blogs initially failed to embrace microblogging doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t take that format back with better server apps and clients.</p>
<p>When people first started paying attention to Twitter, the criticism was that no one cared &#8220;what you had for breakfast&#8221;. But if you look at some of my earliest posts on this weblog, many are equally trivial. What appears unremarkable today — the first lunch you had with co-workers at a brand new job, the stop at REI to get a tent for an upcoming family campout, the missed flight on the way to a great conference — might carry important meaning in later years, looking back. It hurts the web to keep that <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/09/28/myManifestoForWebWriting.html">locked in a silo</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I migrated to WordPress and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/owning-the-microblog.html">started a microblog section on this site</a>, the RSS feeds didn&#8217;t transition very well. While the old feed continued to work, WordPress&#8217;s new default /feed URL returned both full posts and snippet posts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve fixed that today. Here are the official feeds on the site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.manton.org/rss.xml">/rss.xml</a>: All the main posts (like the one you&#8217;re reading right now), but none of the microblog-style snippet posts.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.manton.org/snippets.xml">/snippets.xml</a>: Just the microblog posts. These don&#8217;t have a title and will (eventually) be more common than the main posts, so you&#8217;ll need to subscribe separately if you want to see them.</li>
<li>/feed: Now redirects to /rss.xml.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to see everything I write here, subscribe to both the main feed and the snippets feed. If you want to see only the longer posts, just keep the main feed. Thanks for reading!</p>
