			<p>Following a similar pattern as <a href="../coffee-shops-austin.html">my 30 days of coffee shops</a>, my friend Jon Hays has started mapping out a challenge to hit a month of coffee shops in Portland. The twist on his visits will be to focus mostly on the east side of Portland, and to only have lattes. First post: <a href="http://jonhays.me/2016/04/01/cathedral-coffee/">Cathedral Coffee</a>.</p>
<p>Jon is documenting the coffee shop visits on <a href="http://jonhays.me/">his new microblog</a>. An indie microblog is a great framework for posting this kind of thing, without the overhead and pressure that many people feel when faced with writing full-length blog posts.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/tag/500lattes">the 500 latte photos</a> project by Aron Parecki, which looks like it wrapped up at a (still impressive) 312 lattes; and <a href="http://www.tinychallenges.com/">Tiny Challenges</a>, a site and podcast from Daniel Steinberg and Jaimee Newberry about trying something new each day for a month.</p>

			</h1>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In my posts about <a href="../2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">defining what makes a microblog post</a> and <a href="../2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">guidelines for RSS</a>, I talked a little about links but didn&#8217;t explore linkblogging. While many blog authors post primarily long essays, shorter link blogs are a common approach for bloggers who want to post new content several times a day.</p>
<p>Essentially two types of link blogs have evolved since the early days of blogging. The most traditional link blog can be seen in <a href="http://scripting.com/#linksTab">Dave Winer&#8217;s posts</a> (click on the Links tab). These are links with a very short commentary. Many tweets are like this. In a way, this format is the purest form of microblogging.</p>
<p>The second type of link blog starts to fall outside the limits of microblogging. Instead of just including a URL, authors use a quote from the linked material as the foundation for the post. The majority of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> posts adopt this format. While John Gruber is known for his full essays, those longer posts are infrequent today. He keeps his site active by linking to other interesting essays and tacking on his own brief opinion.</p>
<p>Daring Fireball has become so successful that Gruber&#8217;s approach to linkblogging has been copied by many other sites. <a href="http://macstories.net/">MacStories</a>, <a href="http://sixcolors.com/">Six Colors</a>, <a href="http://onefoottsunami.com/">One Foot Tsunami</a>, <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/">John Moltz&#8217;s Very Nice Web Site</a>, and <a href="http://marco.org/">Marco Arment&#8217;s blog</a> are just a handful that follow this pattern. All of these sites post the occasional essay, but most blog posts link away to an external site in the RSS item, not back to their own site.</p>
<p>At a technical level, this difference can best be seen in the RSS feed&#8217;s &lt;link&gt; and &lt;guid&gt; elements. These elements will contain URLs that either link back to the main site, or link away to an external site.</p>
<p>Here is where this evolving approach to link blogs starts to break down. Let&#8217;s take an example from Six Colors, one of my favorite sites. (I recommend <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">subscribing</a>. The members-only secret podcast with Jason and Dan Moren is really fun, and the email magazine is great too.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://sixcolors.com/link/2015/09/hulu-unlocks-the-albatross/">link post about Hulu&#8217;s pricing</a>, Jason Snell actually writes <em>4 paragraphs</em> of commentary (plus a footnote). This is more like an essay than a short link post that points to the external site.</p>
<p>Another example is when <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/twitter-launches-moments/">MacStories linked to Twitter&#8217;s launch of Moments</a>. A few paragraphs of quoted text, <em>5 paragraphs</em> of MacStories commentary. The commentary is as important or even more important to read than whatever Federico is linking to.</p>
<p>Sometimes we read sites like MacStories, Six Colors, or Daring Fireball more for the commentary than for what is being linked to. But when using an RSS reader, there is too much confusion about where an item&#8217;s link goes when clicked if the site&#8217;s feed isn&#8217;t consistent about linking everything back to its own site.</p>
<p>And in fact Jason Snell acknowledges this problem by offering two separate RSS feeds: the default one, with a mix of links back to Six Colors for essays and pointed elsewhere for link posts; and another feed with everything linking back to Six Colors, where the commentary lives. He also attempts to minimize confusion on his own site by giving each type of post its own icon in the site design.</p>
<p>The less clear-cut the distinction between essays and link posts, the more confusion we introduce to readers. In some ways, this mixed approach really <em>only</em> works for Daring Fireball, because his feature essays are so long, and so obviously different in format to the rest of the link posts.</p>
<p>Good conventions for blogging have been at a standstill for years. While part of the appeal of indie blogging is there&#8217;s no one &#8220;right&#8221; way to do it, and authors can have a strong voice and design that isn&#8217;t controlled by a platform vendor, we must accept that Twitter has taken off because it has a great user experience compared to blogs. It’s effortless to tweet and the timeline is consistent. For blogging to improve and thrive, it should have just as straightforward a user experience as social networks wherever possible.</p>
<p>Luckily, RSS already has everything we need for clients to visually distinguish between link posts and regular ones. If the &lt;link&gt; element points to a domain other than the one for the site, it’s probably a link post. If the &lt;link&gt; and site domain match, it’s a full post.</p>
<p>I’ve adopted this in my new microblogging platform by exposing the domain in the UI itself, at the end of the title or microblog post whenever it’s a link post. If it’s a full post, the link isn’t added. And for either type of post, the timestamp links back to whatever was in the &lt;link&gt;.</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot from one of Dave’s posts. Note that the link was <em>not</em> in the RSS text. It was added by my app automatically:</p>
<p><center><img src="../images/2016/snippets_linkblog.png" width="550" height="105" alt="linkblog example" border="0" /></center></p>
<p>This has been a long post, but it boils down to two simple recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re a blog author and you’re adding any significant commentary, the RSS feed should point back to your site.</li>
<li>If you’re an RSS client developer, the difference between link posts and full posts should be exposed in the UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that adopting these will bring more consistency to blogging. Users won’t need to hover over links, or guess what will happen on a click or tap. It’s a small change that will make reading blogs a little better.</p>

			<p>On the latest <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/16">Under the Radar podcast</a>, Marco Arment and David Smith talk about ways to make your app more robust. That includes tips for scaling your app with a lot of data, and also dealing with potentially hostile user data. It’s that last point that I’ve been thinking the most about lately.</p>
<p>With the experience of building Tumblr and Instapaper, Marco is clearly now hesitant to ship app features that accept arbitrary user-generated content, because a small indie company just doesn’t have the resources to deal with spam and abuse. Instead, he suggests outsourcing whenever possible. For example, letting Apple accept and reject podcasts, and basing the Overcast podcast directory search on that already-vetted list.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re building a Twitter-like service. As we all know, hate is widespread on Twitter. At times, it seems impossible to even have a G-rated Twitter experience. But the problem is less that users can publish terrible tweets, and more that it is so easy to be <em>exposed to those tweets</em> with search, trending topics, retweets, and replies.</p>
<p>As I work on my microblogging project, I’m trying to be aware of these points in the platform where bad content can leak out. So I don’t have global search or trending topics. I also don’t make it easy to stumble upon random users. But I do have replies, which by default will currently go out as push notifications if you have the iPhone app installed. It’s that area that I should focus my attention.</p>
<p>Two options that come to mind for minimizing abuse in replies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t allow replies from people you aren’t following. This solves the problem, but it comes at the expense of discussion. It removes the accessibility that many people love about Twitter’s asynchronous following model.</li>
<li>Quarantine or attempt to classify replies so they don’t bubble up in your timeline or as notifications by default. This would be like an over-aggressive email spam filter. Difficult to get right and possibly routed around by clever microbloggers.</li>
</ul>
<p>After listening to Marco and David, and reviewing the full scope of what I’ve been trying to build, I’m pretty concerned about this. I’m looking at <a href="https://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, and other metrics internal to my app for judging content and suspicious user accounts, but I may be a little in over my head on this issue.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Starting back in September 2014, I added microblog posts to this site. These are defined as <a href="../2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">short posts without a title</a>. They have their own RSS feed, and they’re automatically cross-posted to Twitter and App.net.</p>
<p>In that time, I’ve posted about 300 microblog posts and about 230 essays, although many of my longer posts are really just a few paragraphs and a quote. I still find the microblog format very convenient for quick thoughts, or a series of related posts like <a href="newcoffee.html">all my coffee stops</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve also switched from Gaug.es to WordPress.com stats. While I agree with Ben Brooks that <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/10/death-to-analytics/">analytics can be a distraction</a>, I still like finding new referrers and having a sense of what posts have resonated with people. Not that it effects what I write about, though.</p>
<p>The key to blogging is still consistency and passion. Write about the things you care about, regularly, and the internet is a big enough place that there can be an audience for even obscure topics.</p>
<p>That’s the theme I’m trying to apply to my new <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable podcast</a>, too. I talk about microblogging, coffee shops, client work, but more important than any of that is the routine of recording it. The short nature of the podcast is itself kind of the story.</p>
<p>I’m at episode 15 now and have loved working on it. I now expect that all of these components of my blog — the longer posts, the microblog posts, and the companion Timetable episodes — will be something I do for years to come.</p>

			<p>The folks at Realmac have been <a href="http://blog.typed.com/">blogging about their progress with Typed.com</a>, a new blogging platform that successfully raised $120k on Indiegogo last year. In the <a href="http://blog.typed.com/posts/typed-monthly-report-january-2016">latest monthly report</a>, they announce a new free tier:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With this new free tier, people can sign-up, use the service, take their time. They can blog for free, for as long as they want, and when they need or want the extra features we offer they can upgrade to a paid account. We also think this will be free marketing for the service, the more blog out there that are hosted with Typed.com then more people will find out about the service.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>This blog is in the spirit of <a href="https://open.buffer.com/">Buffer’s open blog</a> or <a href="https://ghost.baremetrics.com/">Ghost’s Baremetrics reports</a>. It’s especially great to see a company sharing numbers when they know they still have a lot of growth ahead of them to get where they want to be.</p>
<p>If you’d like to start a new blog but aren’t sure where to host it, <a href="http://www.typed.com/">check it out</a>. Typed.com has a well-designed admin UI that is refreshingly simple compared to much of the more bloated web software out there.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to use Typed.com as a microblog. I pointed to <a href="../2015/07/microblogging-with-typed-com.html">some tips for this last year</a>. Since the title of a post can’t be blank on Typed.com, I suggest using a date/time for the title. My new microblog platform is smart about treating those kind of short posts correctly when reading from an RSS feed.</p>

			<p>Two new microblog-related services have launched. This week, <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/09/0995.html">Dave Winer announced River5</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “So I decided it was time to do a restart of my JavaScript RSS aggregator, and it&#8217;s now ready for Node users &#8212; it&#8217;s called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a>. [&#8230;] This is a foundation for developers to build on, but it&#8217;s also possible for an adventurous user to set up their own rivers.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>River5 is built on a few XML and JSON formats, including River.js. I’m pretty interested in River.js as a format for aggregating multiple feeds together, so I’ve supported it in my new microblog platform. As a next-generation RSS, though, I prefer the proposal I wrote about in a post called <a href="../2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">RSS for microblogs</a>.</p>
<p>Next up is <a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt">twtxt</a>, which attempts to recreate Twitter as a distributed, command-line based system with self-hosted text files:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Instead of signing up at a closed and/or regulated microblogging platform, getting your status updates out with twtxt is as easy as putting them in a publicly accessible text file. The URL pointing to this file is your identity, your account. twtxt then tracks these text files, like a feedreader, and builds your unique timeline out of them, depending on which files you track.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m less sure what to think of twtxt. The simple plaintext format is nice, but we already have a good infrastructure for this with RSS. And <a href="../2016/01/inline-links-in-microblog-posts.html">as I’ve noted before</a>, having HTML in RSS with inline styles and links is nice for microblogs, and it’s not clear to me whether that would fit well with twtxt.</p>
<p>If you want to start an indie microblog, my suggestion remains to use existing blog software that can generate simple RSS feeds. Short posts, no titles. This is a widely-deployed format that we can continue to work with for years to come.</p>

			<p>Charles Perry has started a microblog. On the balance of what he should post to Twitter and what he should post to his own site first, <a href="http://dazeend.org/2016/02/dazeend-org-microblog/">he writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Most of the things I write on Twitter are snippets of conversations or other thoughts that I don’t necessarily want to preserve. Those will stay on Twitter. But some microposts—is that a thing?—I think are of interest on their own. These I plan to post to the DazeEnd.org microblog and mirror to Twitter. That should allow me to preserve and archive my thoughts on my own website and use Twitter just for distribution.&#8221;

<p>I was really happy to see these posts show up in my RSS reader. There&#8217;s some momentum around indie microblogging right now. You should start one too.</p>

			<p>When I was first trying to figure out how my microblog posts should look, I was thinking more like tweets and less like HTML. Eventually I settled on HTML for publishing and display, with Markdown for writing.</p>
<p>Here’s what a microblog post looks like in the timeline for my new web app:</p>
<p><center><img src="../images/2016/spurs_inline_tweet.png" width="602" height="158" alt="screenshot" /></center></p>
<p>You can compare that to <a href="https://twitter.com/manton2/status/691601075535654914">how it looks</a> when cross-posted to Twitter. It’s not exactly a fair comparison since the tweet was truncated, but it’s still incredible to me how much better these posts look if you allow inline links and some more characters.</p>

			<p>Soroush Khanlou, looking for <a href="http://khanlou.com/2016/01/a-call-for-blogs/">more new blogs to read</a>, makes a great point that the process of blogging leads to better writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Opening my RSS reading and finding 30 unread items makes me happy. Opening Twitter and seeing 150 new tweets feels like work. I&#8217;m not sure why that is. I think Twitter has become more negative, and the ease of posting quick bursts makes posting negative stuff easy. With blogging, writing something long requires time, words, and an argument. Even the passing thought of ‘should I post this’ creates a filter that lets only better <em>stuff</em> through.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think there’s something to that. It’s often only after writing our thoughts down that we fully understand how we feel about a topic.</p>
<p>And here’s where I bring this back to microblogging. Because when starting a post, we don&#8217;t always know whether it will be long or short. How often have you seen a series of tweets that in hindsight even the author would agree should have been a blog post?</p>
<p>This is less of a problem if instead of tweeting you start out with the intention of posting to your own site. Short post can stay short, and posts requiring more words can naturally expand to a full essay.</p>
<p>I don’t think that our short-form, seemingly unimportant writing should exclusively be on centralized networks. If it’s worth the time to write something — whether a thoughtful essay or a fleeting one-off microblog post — then it’s worth owning and publishing at your own domain name.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/notes/on-twitter-going-beyond-140-characters/">Federico Viticci covers</a> the news that Twitter will expand from 140 characters to 10,000, nicknaming the feature Twitter Notes. His nickname is appropriate given this latest transformation to become more like Facebook, since Facebook&#8217;s Medium-like capability for long posts is also called Facebook Notes.</p>
<p>The tweets and blog commentary on this have really missed a key aspect and cause for concern, though. Many posts – including even <a href="../2016/01/twitters-10k-limit.html">my own first attempt</a> – have focused on whether Twitter Notes would water down Twitter&#8217;s unique strength. They then conclude that it&#8217;s better to include a long-form text feature rather than the compromise hack of screenshot text and tweetstorms. Federico sums up this endorsement with the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Unlike other recent additions to the service, I want to believe that third-party developers will be able to support the feature in their clients (Jack seems to suggest as much) and that the iPad won’t be left behind again. I may be disappointed when the day comes, but if done right (see Matthew’s points <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/684484999253381120">here</a>) and as long as Twitter Notes are intended as attachments for regular tweets with real text, I don’t see why I would be against them.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s why this matters, and it gets back to my post last week <a href="../2016/01/hyperlinks-and-saving-the-web.html">about the hyperlink</a>. Closed platforms want to trap all activity, not send it out. The danger in Twitter Notes isn&#8217;t that they will replace textshots, it&#8217;s that <em>they will replace external blogs</em>.</p>
<p>For all of Twitter&#8217;s problems, at least right now most of the good writing we see on Twitter is actually linked out to external blogs (and yes, increasingly Medium posts). To shift that to be stored more on Twitter itself would be a setback for the open web. It would slowly train a new generation of timeline surfers to prefer Twitter-hosted content instead of blogs.</p>
<p>I wrote the above in draft form, and then later saw <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/twitter-10000-the-problem-with-links-the-business-of-expanded-tweets/">Ben Thompson&#8217;s daily update</a> about the Twitter news. His take is the first I had seen that directly covered the issues of linking, even suggesting that no one really clicks on links anymore. But while he&#8217;s worried about Twitter from a business standpoint, I&#8217;m more worried about the attack on the web.</p>
<p>Ben also mentioned the clever trick Jack Dorsey used in writing his response as a textshot. Daniel Jalkut pointed out the same thing in <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/01/episode-214-you-of-all-people-should-understand/">the latest Core Intuition</a>. Jack could have posted it to a blog, or to Medium, but he deliberately picked the worst way to work around Twitter&#8217;s current 140-character limit, to underscore his point.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/01/05/twitter_isn_t_raising_the_140_character_limit_it_s_building_a_wall.html">Will Oremus writes for Slate</a> about the potential new Twitter walled garden:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;What’s really changing here, then, is not the length of the tweet. It’s where that link at the bottom takes you when you click on it—or, rather, where it <em>doesn’t</em> take you. Instead of funneling traffic to blogs, news sites, and other sites around the Web, the &#8216;read more&#8217; button will keep you playing in Twitter’s own garden.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I know we can&#8217;t rewind the clock to the heyday of the blogosphere. But we can still do more. More to encourage bloggers, more to spread awareness about how the web is supposed to work, and more to value open APIs. I think it starts with 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build tools for independent microblogging, to make blogging just as easy as tweeting. I&#8217;m trying to do this.</li>
<li>Make the web faster, so the cost of clicking on a link goes down. Google&#8217;s helping this <a href="../2016/01/lighter-faster-mobile-web.html">with AMP</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was encouraged when I saw that <a href="http://stream.withknown.com/2015/a-short-note-about-web-standards-from-your-friends-at">Known had added support for AMP</a>. They have their doubts about AMP, but at least they were quick to try it. From the Known blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;We&#8217;ve shipped support for AMP because we see potential here, and recognize that something should be done to improve the experience of loading independently-published content on the web. But attempting to bake certain businesses into a web standard is a malformed idea that is doomed to fail. If this is not corrected in future versions of the specification, we will withdraw support.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe AMP ends up being too ad-friendly to become a good standard. I don&#8217;t know. But if so, we&#8217;ll move to the next idea, because the web has to be faster. Slow pages are like a disease for links.</p>
<p>Anyone with a blog should be concerned about what could happen with Twitter&#8217;s 10,000-character push. We won&#8217;t feel the effects right away, but years from now it will matter. We should do more not just to promote blogs and writing on the open web, but to also make it easier for Twitter alternatives to exist through independent microblogging.</p>

			<p><a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/11/0832.html">Dave Winer gives 3 reasons</a> why you should be posting short items to your blog, including:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Maybe your blogging software doesn&#8217;t support short items? Don&#8217;t worry, if people post more short items the software will adjust.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m counting on this. I have a <a href="../snippets.xml">separate RSS feed for microblog posts</a>, and it doesn&#8217;t look great in some news readers because the title is blank. Some folks have asked whether I should include a fake title there — the first few words of the post, or a timestamp. But the RSS spec is clear that title is optional. Only by breaking things a little will RSS readers improve to gracefully support title-less short posts.</p>

			<p>Hossein Derakhshan spent 6 years in jail in Iran because of his blog. Now, with the clarity of seeing years of changes to the web and social networks all at once after his release, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/29/irans-blogfather-facebook-instagram-and-twitter-are-killing-the-web">he&#8217;s written an important essay</a> on the value of hyperlinks and the open web:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;When a powerful website – say Google or Facebook – gazes at, or links to, another webpage, it doesn’t just connect it , it brings it into existence; gives it life. Without this empowering gaze, your web page doesn’t breathe. No matter how many links you have placed in a webpage, unless somebody is looking at it, it is actually both dead and blind, and therefore incapable of transferring power to any outside web page.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>He mentions apps like Instagram, which have no way to link to the outside world. Too many apps are exactly like this: more interested in capturing eyeballs for ads than opening up their platform. The default for native mobile apps is to become silos, while the default for web sites is to be open and support linking.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a second part to Hossein&#8217;s essay that I don&#8217;t agree with, though. He writes that &#8220;the stream&#8221; – a.k.a the timeline, a reverse-chronological list of short posts or links – is turning the web into television. But I think there&#8217;s a lot we can learn from the timeline. It&#8217;s a valuable user experience metaphor that we should take back from Twitter and social networks.</p>
<p>Building on the timeline is basically the whole point of my microblogging project. We should encourage independent microblogs by using a timeline interface to make them more useful. (Interested? <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">Sign up</a> on my announce list.)</p>
<p>Back to links. Dave Winer, who has been cross-posting recently to Facebook and Medium, <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/01/03/0783.html">posted about</a> how Facebook doesn&#8217;t allow inline links in the text of a post. As a new generation grows up on these kind of posts instead of real blog posts, will people understand what they&#8217;re missing? Dave writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I hope we don&#8217;t end up having to try to explain linking to future generations who have no recollection of an electronic writing environment where words could take you to a whole other place. But I suspect we&#8217;re going there. Unless somehow we can get Facebook to relent and make it easy to link from words in Facebook posts to other places on the web.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a great challenge for 2016. Not specifically with Facebook, but with the larger idea of bringing back <a href="http://anildash.com/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">the web we lost</a>, retrofitted for today&#8217;s app-centric internet. I hope to spend a good part of the year working on it.</p>

<p>I like what ESPN is doing in the sidebar <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/scoreboard">on their NBA scores page</a>. It&#8217;s a timeline of both tweets and short ESPN posts, integrated together with a clean design that fits the rest of the site.</p>
<p>This timeline is a great use of microblogging. The short posts aren&#8217;t limited to tweet-length — they&#8217;re often around 200 characters instead — so they can feel complete and informative while still being concise. <a href="../2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">I&#8217;ve suggested 280 characters</a> as a guideline for microblogs, and having the extra characters to work with really makes a nice difference.</p>
<p>I took an example screenshot from ESPN and included it to the right of this post. The first two posts are these special ESPN microblog posts, and the third is a tweet. I don&#8217;t know what CMS-like system is driving this, but you can imagine using WordPress post formats, custom fields, or categories to achieve something similar.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="https://twitter.com/manton/status/254228056657494016">Three years ago today</a> I posted my last personal tweet. That time and distance away from mainstream social networking has given me a new perspective on the importance of independent microblogging. It has shaped <a href="../category/micro.html">where I write</a> and what tools I build.</p>
<p>But Twitter remains as fascinating as ever. Just a few weeks ago, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/11891887/adam-bain-interview-twitter-jack-dorsey.html">the board seemed unsure</a> about letting Jack Dorsey split his time between Twitter and Square:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The responsibilities of running Square, which Dorsey reportedly refuses to give up, may now stand in the way of a Steve <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/steve-jobs/">Jobs-esque</a> return as Twitter’s full time chief executive. In June, its board took the unusual step of publicly declaring that it would only consider candidates &#8216;who are in a position to make a full-time commitment to Twitter&#8217;, a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/11691834/Jack-Dorsey-will-have-to-quit-as-Square-boss-to-take-charge-of-Twitter.html">thinly-veiled reference to Dorsey’s preoccupations</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Then they <a href="http://recode.net/2015/09/30/sources-jack-dorsey-to-be-named-permanent-twitter-ceo/">backed away from that</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;That declaration, as it seems to have turned out, has been a largely empty one. The idea that Dorsey might return gained steam among people both inside and outside the company over the past few months even though he had no intention of leaving Square. He even referred to the companies as his two children when discussing the dilemma, according to a source.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Today they officially announced that Jack will return to lead Twitter. Of all the recent articles, my favorite <a href="http://recode.net/2015/10/02/why-jack-dorsey-is-ready-to-save-twitter/">is this one from Recode</a>, a long profile on Jack&#8217;s role and changing attitude:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;He seems to be a completely different man than the one who returned to Twitter in March 2011 as executive chairman and product czar. Former colleagues recall a man looking for payback for his 2008 ouster; loyalty was key, and many who were loyal to Twitter’s other co-founder, Ev Williams, were booted from the company. Back then, Dorsey would routinely sit in on meetings without saying a word. When he did speak, his contributions were so abstract that few understood what he was talking about. In some cases, he’d simply write a single word or two up on the whiteboard.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>And it goes on, showing how Jack has matured as a leader. Everyone will be watching what he does, and how Twitter evolves. Every article written about an upcoming Twitter feature will mention Jack&#8217;s involvement, no matter how insignificant. He&#8217;s a big part of the story now.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@ev/why-i-m-glad-jack-is-back-at-twitter-9bbda2ae5dca">Ev also wrote</a> about the official announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Twitter is bigger and more important to the world than we ever dreamed when we started. And it still has incredible, unrealized potential. It will not be easy to unlock it. But we have thousands of smart, creative people working every day to make the company great. And Jack has already demonstrated the ability to inspire the team and think boldly about the next phase of Twitter.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The greatest challenge for Jack will be figuring out how to take whatever those thousands of employees are working on and turn it into actual user-facing features that ship to customers. Federico Viticci, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot/">reviewing the new Tweetbot 4 release</a> last week, wrote about how Tapbots has built something more ambitious than the official Twitter for iPad app, even though Twitter has a much bigger team:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;On the other hand, Twitter for iPad – long ignored by the company – has emerged again <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/twitter-aims-to-unify-ios-apps-updates-its-ipad-app/">with a stretched-up iPhone layout</a> presented in the name of &#8216;consistency&#8217;. It&#8217;s a grim landscape, devoid of the excitement and curiosity that surrounded Twitter clients five years ago.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I still run <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker</a>, which was created during that period of innovation that Federico refers to, but my focus now is on indie microblogging and the open web. I&#8217;m content to watch Twitter from the sidelines and wish Jack the best of luck.</p>

			<p>The flip side to the optimism of <a href="../2015/08/doubt-with-screenshots.html">my last post</a> is the hard reality that sometimes the doubt <em>is</em> warranted. Sometimes, a little caution could lead to better, more reasonable business decisions.</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2015/07/24/in-defense-of-pessimism/">this post from Brett Terpstra</a> about how his wife provides some balance:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “For every wild idea I plan out, she reminds me of the realistic outcomes, backed with historical data. If it weren’t for the tempering quality of having &#8216;pessimists&#8217; around, I’d be living in a tiny apartment, buried in debt, and likely friendless.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to do a better job of bouncing ideas off other people before fully committing, while still holding on to a strong enough original concept that I can&#8217;t get too distracted or discouraged. I also have a new idea to help lay the groundwork for my new microblogging service, before actually shipping it. Hope to announce more in the next couple of weeks.</p>

			<p>My good friend and Core Intuition co-host <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel Jalkut</a> isn&#8217;t convinced. After we recorded last week&#8217;s podcast, we talked privately about the direction I&#8217;m headed in. He&#8217;s seen the projects I have in development, but he thinks working on Mac apps is a safer bet than web services. And he works on a blogging app, so if I can&#8217;t convince him that the goals I have around microblogging-related tools can be a real business, how am I going to convince the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Earlier this year I gave a talk at CocoaConf about tips I&#8217;ve learned to be productive while juggling multiple projects. But as I worked on the talk, it turned out to be about something else. It was about Walt Disney moving from Kansas City to Hollywood. It was about crazy side projects that no one else believed in. It was about Texas Hold &#8216;Em poker and risking everything for an idea.</p>
<p>The new microblogging app and service I&#8217;ve been working on, off and on for the last year, is the most ambitious project I&#8217;ve ever attempted. It is difficult to explain and market, it might only resonate with a niche audience, and it is going to increase my hosting costs. So part of me knows that Daniel is right — that the smart business decision is to put it on hold and focus on my Mac apps, which will probably have more predictable revenue.</p>
<p>And yet, this project is also the most meaningful. In the words of Peter Thiel, it could take independent microblogging from <a href="http://zerotoonebook.com/">zero to one</a>. A new push forward for weblogs, maybe the first in a while. Therefore, I must do it, and I must accept some risk in the process.</p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been working on the iPhone version. When you look at these screenshots, it might be tempting to compare it to Twitter. Don&#8217;t. Instead, think about how the plumbing fits together: RSS, microblogs, and the open web.</p>
<p><img src="../images/2015/snippets_iphone_screenshots.png" width="607" height="344" alt="screenshot" border="0" /></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to officially announce and ship this. If you&#8217;d like to get an email when the beta is ready, <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the announcement list</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="../2015/07/microblogging-with-typed-com.html">Last week I mentioned</a> Typed.com and Elliot Jackson’s tips in the Realmac forums for posting via Drafts and Editorial. Now Elliot has expanded his solution <a href="http://casualnotebook.com/posts/microblogging-with-typedcom">into a full blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The gist of it is that your post, written in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id905337691?at=1l3vn5T">Drafts</a>, gets sent to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8&amp;at=1l3vn5T">Editorial</a> which will take care of the publishing part thanks to it’s ability to run Python and Javascript scripts in it’s built in browser. The post could be both written and published from Editorial, but as nearly everything I do on my phone runs through Drafts anyway, it made sense for this to too.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been using Editorial as my default iOS text editor for a while. I have a “Notes” folder on Dropbox that I use like Simplenote, but driven from <a href="http://www.selfcoded.com/justnotes/">Justnotes</a> on the Mac and accessible via Editorial or any iOS editor. But I’ve just barely scratched the surface of what is possible with Editorial. It’s one of those rare apps that is fine for new users, but which also contains a great depth of features when you’re ready to explore underneath the initial layer of its UI.</p>

			<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2015/07/03/tooMuchLinearThinkingInNews.html">Dave Winer writes about Circa</a> and their fundamental mistake of not embracing the open web with easy linking:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Linkblogging is a real thing, and there are people who are good at it. But if there&#8217;s no URL for each story, you can&#8217;t linkblog it. So they didn&#8217;t grow fast enough. I think this is almost mathematical. No one, going forward, should try this. Each story must have a way to get to it through a Web address.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>We can be cynical about what the “open web” means, thinking it’s just marketing or spin. But it’s real and Dave shows how obvious it is to understand. It doesn’t matter if a web site or iPhone app is based around web technologies like HTTP and HTML. If it can’t be <em>linked to</em> or there’s no web API, it isn’t part of the open web.</p>
<p>Linkblogging is a special form of microblogging, and a significant part of Twitter is actually linkblogging. Tools that understand linkblogging will typically reduce the friction of writing by prompting for a quick note to go with a URL that’s already on the clipboard, for example. I don’t usually blog in this style, but I made sure these linkblog posts look great in the platform I’m working on.</p>
