<p>I like what ESPN is doing in the sidebar <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/scoreboard">on their NBA scores page</a>. It&#8217;s a timeline of both tweets and short ESPN posts, integrated together with a clean design that fits the rest of the site.</p>
<p>This timeline is a great use of microblogging. The short posts aren&#8217;t limited to tweet-length — they&#8217;re often around 200 characters instead — so they can feel complete and informative while still being concise. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">I&#8217;ve suggested 280 characters</a> as a guideline for microblogs, and having the extra characters to work with really makes a nice difference.</p>
<p>I took an example screenshot from ESPN and included it to the right of this post. The first two posts are these special ESPN microblog posts, and the third is a tweet. I don&#8217;t know what CMS-like system is driving this, but you can imagine using WordPress post formats, custom fields, or categories to achieve something similar.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/manton/status/254228056657494016">Three years ago today</a> I posted my last personal tweet. That time and distance away from mainstream social networking has given me a new perspective on the importance of independent microblogging. It has shaped <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">where I write</a> and what tools I build.</p>
<p>But Twitter remains as fascinating as ever. Just a few weeks ago, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/11891887/adam-bain-interview-twitter-jack-dorsey.html">the board seemed unsure</a> about letting Jack Dorsey split his time between Twitter and Square:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The responsibilities of running Square, which Dorsey reportedly refuses to give up, may now stand in the way of a Steve <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/steve-jobs/">Jobs-esque</a> return as Twitter’s full time chief executive. In June, its board took the unusual step of publicly declaring that it would only consider candidates &#8216;who are in a position to make a full-time commitment to Twitter&#8217;, a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/11691834/Jack-Dorsey-will-have-to-quit-as-Square-boss-to-take-charge-of-Twitter.html">thinly-veiled reference to Dorsey’s preoccupations</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Then they <a href="http://recode.net/2015/09/30/sources-jack-dorsey-to-be-named-permanent-twitter-ceo/">backed away from that</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;That declaration, as it seems to have turned out, has been a largely empty one. The idea that Dorsey might return gained steam among people both inside and outside the company over the past few months even though he had no intention of leaving Square. He even referred to the companies as his two children when discussing the dilemma, according to a source.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Today they officially announced that Jack will return to lead Twitter. Of all the recent articles, my favorite <a href="http://recode.net/2015/10/02/why-jack-dorsey-is-ready-to-save-twitter/">is this one from Recode</a>, a long profile on Jack&#8217;s role and changing attitude:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;He seems to be a completely different man than the one who returned to Twitter in March 2011 as executive chairman and product czar. Former colleagues recall a man looking for payback for his 2008 ouster; loyalty was key, and many who were loyal to Twitter’s other co-founder, Ev Williams, were booted from the company. Back then, Dorsey would routinely sit in on meetings without saying a word. When he did speak, his contributions were so abstract that few understood what he was talking about. In some cases, he’d simply write a single word or two up on the whiteboard.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>And it goes on, showing how Jack has matured as a leader. Everyone will be watching what he does, and how Twitter evolves. Every article written about an upcoming Twitter feature will mention Jack&#8217;s involvement, no matter how insignificant. He&#8217;s a big part of the story now.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@ev/why-i-m-glad-jack-is-back-at-twitter-9bbda2ae5dca">Ev also wrote</a> about the official announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Twitter is bigger and more important to the world than we ever dreamed when we started. And it still has incredible, unrealized potential. It will not be easy to unlock it. But we have thousands of smart, creative people working every day to make the company great. And Jack has already demonstrated the ability to inspire the team and think boldly about the next phase of Twitter.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The greatest challenge for Jack will be figuring out how to take whatever those thousands of employees are working on and turn it into actual user-facing features that ship to customers. Federico Viticci, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot/">reviewing the new Tweetbot 4 release</a> last week, wrote about how Tapbots has built something more ambitious than the official Twitter for iPad app, even though Twitter has a much bigger team:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;On the other hand, Twitter for iPad – long ignored by the company – has emerged again <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/twitter-aims-to-unify-ios-apps-updates-its-ipad-app/">with a stretched-up iPhone layout</a> presented in the name of &#8216;consistency&#8217;. It&#8217;s a grim landscape, devoid of the excitement and curiosity that surrounded Twitter clients five years ago.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I still run <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker</a>, which was created during that period of innovation that Federico refers to, but my focus now is on indie microblogging and the open web. I&#8217;m content to watch Twitter from the sidelines and wish Jack the best of luck.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The flip side to the optimism of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/08/doubt-with-screenshots.html">my last post</a> is the hard reality that sometimes the doubt <em>is</em> warranted. Sometimes, a little caution could lead to better, more reasonable business decisions.</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2015/07/24/in-defense-of-pessimism/">this post from Brett Terpstra</a> about how his wife provides some balance:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “For every wild idea I plan out, she reminds me of the realistic outcomes, backed with historical data. If it weren’t for the tempering quality of having &#8216;pessimists&#8217; around, I’d be living in a tiny apartment, buried in debt, and likely friendless.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to do a better job of bouncing ideas off other people before fully committing, while still holding on to a strong enough original concept that I can&#8217;t get too distracted or discouraged. I also have a new idea to help lay the groundwork for my new microblogging service, before actually shipping it. Hope to announce more in the next couple of weeks.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My good friend and Core Intuition co-host <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel Jalkut</a> isn&#8217;t convinced. After we recorded last week&#8217;s podcast, we talked privately about the direction I&#8217;m headed in. He&#8217;s seen the projects I have in development, but he thinks working on Mac apps is a safer bet than web services. And he works on a blogging app, so if I can&#8217;t convince him that the goals I have around microblogging-related tools can be a real business, how am I going to convince the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Earlier this year I gave a talk at CocoaConf about tips I&#8217;ve learned to be productive while juggling multiple projects. But as I worked on the talk, it turned out to be about something else. It was about Walt Disney moving from Kansas City to Hollywood. It was about crazy side projects that no one else believed in. It was about Texas Hold &#8216;Em poker and risking everything for an idea.</p>
<p>The new microblogging app and service I&#8217;ve been working on, off and on for the last year, is the most ambitious project I&#8217;ve ever attempted. It is difficult to explain and market, it might only resonate with a niche audience, and it is going to increase my hosting costs. So part of me knows that Daniel is right — that the smart business decision is to put it on hold and focus on my Mac apps, which will probably have more predictable revenue.</p>
<p>And yet, this project is also the most meaningful. In the words of Peter Thiel, it could take independent microblogging from <a href="http://zerotoonebook.com/">zero to one</a>. A new push forward for weblogs, maybe the first in a while. Therefore, I must do it, and I must accept some risk in the process.</p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been working on the iPhone version. When you look at these screenshots, it might be tempting to compare it to Twitter. Don&#8217;t. Instead, think about how the plumbing fits together: RSS, microblogs, and the open web.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/snippets_iphone_screenshots.png" width="607" height="344" alt="screenshot" border="0" /></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to officially announce and ship this. If you&#8217;d like to get an email when the beta is ready, <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the announcement list</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/microblogging-with-typed-com.html">Last week I mentioned</a> Typed.com and Elliot Jackson’s tips in the Realmac forums for posting via Drafts and Editorial. Now Elliot has expanded his solution <a href="http://casualnotebook.com/posts/microblogging-with-typedcom">into a full blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The gist of it is that your post, written in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id905337691?at=1l3vn5T">Drafts</a>, gets sent to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8&amp;at=1l3vn5T">Editorial</a> which will take care of the publishing part thanks to it’s ability to run Python and Javascript scripts in it’s built in browser. The post could be both written and published from Editorial, but as nearly everything I do on my phone runs through Drafts anyway, it made sense for this to too.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been using Editorial as my default iOS text editor for a while. I have a “Notes” folder on Dropbox that I use like Simplenote, but driven from <a href="http://www.selfcoded.com/justnotes/">Justnotes</a> on the Mac and accessible via Editorial or any iOS editor. But I’ve just barely scratched the surface of what is possible with Editorial. It’s one of those rare apps that is fine for new users, but which also contains a great depth of features when you’re ready to explore underneath the initial layer of its UI.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2015/07/03/tooMuchLinearThinkingInNews.html">Dave Winer writes about Circa</a> and their fundamental mistake of not embracing the open web with easy linking:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Linkblogging is a real thing, and there are people who are good at it. But if there&#8217;s no URL for each story, you can&#8217;t linkblog it. So they didn&#8217;t grow fast enough. I think this is almost mathematical. No one, going forward, should try this. Each story must have a way to get to it through a Web address.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>We can be cynical about what the “open web” means, thinking it’s just marketing or spin. But it’s real and Dave shows how obvious it is to understand. It doesn’t matter if a web site or iPhone app is based around web technologies like HTTP and HTML. If it can’t be <em>linked to</em> or there’s no web API, it isn’t part of the open web.</p>
<p>Linkblogging is a special form of microblogging, and a significant part of Twitter is actually linkblogging. Tools that understand linkblogging will typically reduce the friction of writing by prompting for a quick note to go with a URL that’s already on the clipboard, for example. I don’t usually blog in this style, but I made sure these linkblog posts look great in the platform I’m working on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dancounsell.com/articles/how-i-raised-120000-dollars-with-crowdfunding">Dan Counsell wrote a long post</a> this week about the planning and executing of Realmac’s crowdfunding campaign for Typed.com. It’s worth a read for the careful thought he put into it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I spent two weeks planning and building the entire campaign. I started out with the video as I knew this would be a huge amount of work and to be honest, it was also something I wasn&#8217;t entirely comfortable with doing. Every popular campaign I looked at had a half-decent and engaging video. I did a lot of research and it turns out the flow of the video should be something like this: Introduce yourself, talk about the problem, move onto the solution that you&#8217;re building, and finally finishing up with a direct plea asking for pledges.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The beta for Typed.com is well underway, and linked in Dan’s post is a support forum for users. <a href="http://community.realmacsoftware.com/t/first-impressions/13/21">This post by Realmac designer Elliot Jackson</a> especially caught my eye:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We don’t have an API yet but this is something I’ve been enjoying playing with for shorter posts. My workaround is to send the content over a URL then decode it and use JS in the browser to fill in the form elements (tags etc).”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He details a way to send short microblog posts to Typed.com by using Drafts and Editorial. Check out the full post for his JavaScript and Python scripts linking these apps together on iOS. I’m really looking forward to Typed.com’s official launch.</p>

Some people have guessed at what it is based on discussions Daniel and I have had on <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, but only a handful of people have seen it.

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the project, you can now <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the announcement mailing list</a> for more information. I&#8217;ll send an email when the beta launches, as well as occasional updates for major new features. Hope you like it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.twitterflight.com/">Twitter&#8217;s new mobile developer conference</a> is tomorrow. <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/10/20/wsj-twitter-peace-offering">Marco Arment writes</a> about whether developers should give Twitter another chance:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Twitter started out as a developer-friendly company, then they became a developer-hostile company, and now they’re trying to be a developer-friendly company again. If I had to pick a company to have absolute power over something very important, Twitter wouldn’t be very high on the list.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2014/10/21/whyISayYesToTwitter.html">Dave Winer responds</a> that for now, we&#8217;ll be okay trusting Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Twitter is not going to screw us in the short term. They need us as much as we need them. Independent developers are where wholly new ideas come from. You can&#8217;t hire people to do that to work inside companies.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The unique tragedy with Twitter&#8217;s changing attitude toward developers is that so many of Twitter&#8217;s early innovations <a href="http://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/">did come from third-party developers</a>. The new leadership displayed an incredible disrespect for the value developers added to both the ecosystem and core platform.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in the &#8220;short term&#8221; it&#8217;s still happening. Not 4 years ago, not 2 years ago — just <em>1 month ago</em>, TwitPic announced they are shutting down after a legal threat from Twitter. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/twitpic-and-whats-next.html">It&#8217;s a loss for the web</a>, leaving millions of broken image links in old tweets. This latest third-party developer casualty from Twitter&#8217;s policies comes practically on the eve of their new developer conference.</p>
<p>I agree with Dave&#8217;s larger points, though, on mirroring content to your own blog in addition to Twitter and Facebook. His <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a> is a step forward for RSS and the open web while still embracing social networks. We need more tools like it.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/manton/status/254228056657494016">2 years ago</a> I chose to stop tweeting from my personal Twitter account as a minor protest. I don&#8217;t expect everyone else to take such an extreme stance. We can agree on open formats and the power of microblogging while disagreeing on how to interact with Twitter.</p>
<p>(Skeptics say that leaving Twitter is a pointless gesture, like a pebble thrown into a river. The timeline flows on and the outrage is washed away as if it didn&#8217;t happen. If leaving doesn&#8217;t make an impact, why bother? But it does matter. It matters not for the change it creates directly for others, but for how it changed me. In the same way that writing an essay will solidify your thoughts on a subject, posting that last tweet has given me a new clarity from which to judge whether my own products are on the right track, living up to my ideals.)</p>
<p>Back to the present. On the flight up to Çingleton and back, I finally got around to reading the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847087/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591847087&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mantonorg&amp;linkId=B2NMWRQKBXSK7MCT">Hatching Twitter</a>. Since I was on Twitter near the beginning, I remember many events covered in the book: the launch at SXSW, the CEO shuffling, the names of early engineers who I&#8217;ve crossed paths with. I love how the book blends together things that I know are real with other details that must be more contrived or exaggerated, creating an engaging read that would seem to border on historical fiction if we didn&#8217;t know that it was basically all true.</p>
<p>Hatching Twitter captures the power struggles inside Twitter and fills a book with them. And that&#8217;s really the foundation for Marco&#8217;s post: based on Twitter&#8217;s history, we probably haven&#8217;t seen the last leadership change at the company. Twitter <em>might</em> have a strong future but it surely has an uncertain one.</p>
<p>My next product is about microblogging, and it has to launch in the real world where Twitter dominates. But I view that as a reality, not a feature requirement. I think I&#8217;ll be happier as a developer, and my app will actually be more compelling, if I design and build it for a world without Twitter.</p>
