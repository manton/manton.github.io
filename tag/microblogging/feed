				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/12/twitter-at-10-years.html">In yesterday&#8217;s essay about Twitter</a>, I also linked to my post on Instagram&#8217;s lack of native reposts. <a href="http://nearthespeedoflight.com/article/2016_12_02_fake_news_on_social_networks">Jason Brennan has written a follow-up</a> about fake news and propaganda, exploring what we can learn and apply to microblogging:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Aside from the normal reasons propaganda exists, it exists on social networks like Facebook and Twitter because it <em>can exist</em> on those networks. It’s <em>profitable</em> and <em>useful</em> for the parties manufacturing and disseminating it. To Facebook and Twitter, upon whose networks it propagates, it doesn’t really matter what the information is so long as it <em>engages</em> users. Facebook’s apathy to propaganda is regularly exploited.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hillary Clinton also connected fake news and propaganda <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/08/hillary-clinton-attacks-fake-news-in-post-election-appearance-on-capitol-hill/">in a speech this week</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Let me just mention briefly one threat in particular that should concern all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents alike, especially those who serve in our Congress: the epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year. It’s now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The internet is at a crossroads. Entrepreneurs love free speech, scale, and money, but those don&#8217;t always align in a good way. As much talk as there is of <em>making an impact</em>, very few leaders in Silicon Valley seem to think deeply about consequences.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://waxy.org/2016/11/redesigning-waxy-2016-edition/">Andy Baio redesigned his blog recently</a> and argued that blogs still matter because of ownership and control. Of course, I agree. And though it may seem far off, there&#8217;s no guarantee that Twitter will outlast our own blogs. Andy writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Twitter, itself, may be acquired and changed in some terrible way. It’s not hard to imagine a post-Verizon Yahoo selling off Tumblr. Medium keeps pivoting, trying to find a successful revenue model. There’s no guarantee any of these platforms will be around in their current state in a year, let alone ten years from now.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ben Brooks <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/11/a-new-waxyorg/">followed up</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Having my own site gives me complete control to do whatever I want, whenever I want, however I want. I don’t understand why people ever want it any other way.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Words are powerful. Especially right now, why let anyone else have control over the format of our words and how they spread? Having a blog is a statement: our writing exists apart from the whim of an algorithmic news feed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">written about IPFS</a> before, but <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid</a> (from Tim Berners-Lee himself, among other MIT folks) is another new proposal for a more distributed web. I wasn’t familiar with it until reading <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/ways-to-decentralize-the-web/">this article at Digital Trends</a>, which first makes the case for independent content vs. the big centralized platforms:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now a handful of companies own vast swaths of web activity – Facebook for social networking, Google for searching, eBay for auctions – and quite literally own the data their users have provided and generated. This gives these companies unprecedented power over us, and gives them such a competitive advantage that it’s pretty silly to think you’re going to start up a business that’s going to beat them at their own game.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The article continues with the types of data you might share in a Solid application:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  For example, you might keep your personal information in one or several pods: the sort of data about yourself that you put into your Facebook profile; a list of your friends, family, and colleagues; your banking information; maps of where you’ve traveled; some health information. That way if someone built a new social networking application—perhaps to compete head-on with Facebook, or, more likely, to offer specialized services to people with shared interests—you could join by giving it permission to access the appropriate information in your pod.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the showcase applications is called Client-Integrated Micro-Blogging Architecture, surely named mostly for its pronounceable acronym. From the <a href="https://github.com/linkeddata/cimba">CIMBA project site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  CIMBA is a privacy-friendly, decentralized microblogging application that runs in your browser. It is built using the latest HTML5 technologies and Web standards. With CIMBA, people get a microblogging app that behaves like Twitter, built entirely out of parts they can control.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Solid and CIMBA are built on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a>, which in turn is based off of RDF. I’m admittedly biased against RDF, because it often brings with it an immediate sense of over-engineering — too abstracted, solving too many problems at once. I’m glad to see this activity around a distributed web, and I’ll be following Solid, but I also continue to believe that the simple microformats and APIs from the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWebCamp</a> are the best place to start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t post as much as I hoped to during WWDC 2016 — just a couple full posts related to the conference, a half dozen microblog posts, and one photo. But nevertheless I wanted to collect them together since I didn&#8217;t have a full wrap-up post <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/wwdc-2015-basketball-and-cartoons.html">like last year</a>.</p>
<p>One of the advantages to hosting my own short posts — and only cross-posting to Twitter as an afterthought, not the primary location — is that I can easily tag all the posts in a series. This worked out really well while <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">visiting coffee shops</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>For WWDC, I&#8217;ve used the tag <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/wwdc2016">#wwdc2016</a>. I probably won&#8217;t go back to tag previous conferences, but I&#8217;ll use this format going forward for attending events where I publish a series of microblog posts and photos.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you were to build a weblog publishing system, would you start from scratch or build on an existing tool? There’s a healthy market for WordPress-powered hosting, for example, from <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> itself to <a href="http://wpengine.com/">WP Engine</a>. People know and trust these tools.</p>
<p>I was faced with this question for my microblogging platform. My requirements were pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>The published site needed to be 100% static, so that I could host it anywhere.</li>
<li>The template system needed to be widely used, so that I could draw on existing themes and provide customization for users later.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> looked like a great choice. I’m so happy with how well this has worked that I mention Jekyll in the marketing and footer of published sites. It’s a brand that can help give users confidence that this is built on something solid, and that if they need to migrate to self-hosted, there’s a path.</p>
<p>On top of Jekyll, I built a web interface for publishing and deleting posts, changing themes, and I added XML-RPC support so that you can use external blog editors like MarsEdit. Plus there’s a native iPhone app for posting.</p>
<p>All of this enables another feature that I’m very excited about: full mirroring to <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. When you publish a microblog site, you can have it upload all the Markdown and HTML to a GitHub repository. This is a great way to export or mirror your content.</p>
<p>I think it’s a good foundation. Publishing is actually a small part of the overall microblog platform I’ve built, but it’s an important one. I can’t wait to share more and keep building features up around Jekyll.</p>
<p>I’m writing a short e-book about everything I’ve learned, and I’ll have news soon about early access to the platform. You should <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the announce mailing list</a> before next week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a similar pattern as <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">my 30 days of coffee shops</a>, my friend Jon Hays has started mapping out a challenge to hit a month of coffee shops in Portland. The twist on his visits will be to focus mostly on the east side of Portland, and to only have lattes. First post: <a href="http://jonhays.me/2016/04/01/cathedral-coffee/">Cathedral Coffee</a>.</p>
<p>Jon is documenting the coffee shop visits on <a href="http://jonhays.me/">his new microblog</a>. An indie microblog is a great framework for posting this kind of thing, without the overhead and pressure that many people feel when faced with writing full-length blog posts.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://aaronparecki.com/tag/500lattes">the 500 latte photos</a> project by Aron Parecki, which looks like it wrapped up at a (still impressive) 312 lattes; and <a href="http://www.tinychallenges.com/">Tiny Challenges</a>, a site and podcast from Daniel Steinberg and Jaimee Newberry about trying something new each day for a month.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my posts about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">defining what makes a microblog post</a> and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">guidelines for RSS</a>, I talked a little about links but didn&#8217;t explore linkblogging. While many blog authors post primarily long essays, shorter link blogs are a common approach for bloggers who want to post new content several times a day.</p>
<p>Essentially two types of link blogs have evolved since the early days of blogging. The most traditional link blog can be seen in <a href="http://scripting.com/#linksTab">Dave Winer&#8217;s posts</a> (click on the Links tab). These are links with a very short commentary. Many tweets are like this. In a way, this format is the purest form of microblogging.</p>
<p>The second type of link blog starts to fall outside the limits of microblogging. Instead of just including a URL, authors use a quote from the linked material as the foundation for the post. The majority of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> posts adopt this format. While John Gruber is known for his full essays, those longer posts are infrequent today. He keeps his site active by linking to other interesting essays and tacking on his own brief opinion.</p>
<p>Daring Fireball has become so successful that Gruber&#8217;s approach to linkblogging has been copied by many other sites. <a href="http://macstories.net/">MacStories</a>, <a href="http://sixcolors.com/">Six Colors</a>, <a href="http://onefoottsunami.com/">One Foot Tsunami</a>, <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/">John Moltz&#8217;s Very Nice Web Site</a>, and <a href="http://marco.org/">Marco Arment&#8217;s blog</a> are just a handful that follow this pattern. All of these sites post the occasional essay, but most blog posts link away to an external site in the RSS item, not back to their own site.</p>
<p>At a technical level, this difference can best be seen in the RSS feed&#8217;s &lt;link&gt; and &lt;guid&gt; elements. These elements will contain URLs that either link back to the main site, or link away to an external site.</p>
<p>Here is where this evolving approach to link blogs starts to break down. Let&#8217;s take an example from Six Colors, one of my favorite sites. (I recommend <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">subscribing</a>. The members-only secret podcast with Jason and Dan Moren is really fun, and the email magazine is great too.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://sixcolors.com/link/2015/09/hulu-unlocks-the-albatross/">link post about Hulu&#8217;s pricing</a>, Jason Snell actually writes <em>4 paragraphs</em> of commentary (plus a footnote). This is more like an essay than a short link post that points to the external site.</p>
<p>Another example is when <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/twitter-launches-moments/">MacStories linked to Twitter&#8217;s launch of Moments</a>. A few paragraphs of quoted text, <em>5 paragraphs</em> of MacStories commentary. The commentary is as important or even more important to read than whatever Federico is linking to.</p>
<p>Sometimes we read sites like MacStories, Six Colors, or Daring Fireball more for the commentary than for what is being linked to. But when using an RSS reader, there is too much confusion about where an item&#8217;s link goes when clicked if the site&#8217;s feed isn&#8217;t consistent about linking everything back to its own site.</p>
<p>And in fact Jason Snell acknowledges this problem by offering two separate RSS feeds: the default one, with a mix of links back to Six Colors for essays and pointed elsewhere for link posts; and another feed with everything linking back to Six Colors, where the commentary lives. He also attempts to minimize confusion on his own site by giving each type of post its own icon in the site design.</p>
<p>The less clear-cut the distinction between essays and link posts, the more confusion we introduce to readers. In some ways, this mixed approach really <em>only</em> works for Daring Fireball, because his feature essays are so long, and so obviously different in format to the rest of the link posts.</p>
<p>Good conventions for blogging have been at a standstill for years. While part of the appeal of indie blogging is there&#8217;s no one &#8220;right&#8221; way to do it, and authors can have a strong voice and design that isn&#8217;t controlled by a platform vendor, we must accept that Twitter has taken off because it has a great user experience compared to blogs. It’s effortless to tweet and the timeline is consistent. For blogging to improve and thrive, it should have just as straightforward a user experience as social networks wherever possible.</p>
<p>Luckily, RSS already has everything we need for clients to visually distinguish between link posts and regular ones. If the &lt;link&gt; element points to a domain other than the one for the site, it’s probably a link post. If the &lt;link&gt; and site domain match, it’s a full post.</p>
<p>I’ve adopted this in my new microblogging platform by exposing the domain in the UI itself, at the end of the title or microblog post whenever it’s a link post. If it’s a full post, the link isn’t added. And for either type of post, the timestamp links back to whatever was in the &lt;link&gt;.</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot from one of Dave’s posts. Note that the link was <em>not</em> in the RSS text. It was added by my app automatically:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2016/snippets_linkblog.png" width="550" height="105" alt="linkblog example" border="0" /></center></p>
<p>This has been a long post, but it boils down to two simple recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re a blog author and you’re adding any significant commentary, the RSS feed should point back to your site.</li>
<li>If you’re an RSS client developer, the difference between link posts and full posts should be exposed in the UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that adopting these will bring more consistency to blogging. Users won’t need to hover over links, or guess what will happen on a click or tap. It’s a small change that will make reading blogs a little better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the latest <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/16">Under the Radar podcast</a>, Marco Arment and David Smith talk about ways to make your app more robust. That includes tips for scaling your app with a lot of data, and also dealing with potentially hostile user data. It’s that last point that I’ve been thinking the most about lately.</p>
<p>With the experience of building Tumblr and Instapaper, Marco is clearly now hesitant to ship app features that accept arbitrary user-generated content, because a small indie company just doesn’t have the resources to deal with spam and abuse. Instead, he suggests outsourcing whenever possible. For example, letting Apple accept and reject podcasts, and basing the Overcast podcast directory search on that already-vetted list.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re building a Twitter-like service. As we all know, hate is widespread on Twitter. At times, it seems impossible to even have a G-rated Twitter experience. But the problem is less that users can publish terrible tweets, and more that it is so easy to be <em>exposed to those tweets</em> with search, trending topics, retweets, and replies.</p>
<p>As I work on my microblogging project, I’m trying to be aware of these points in the platform where bad content can leak out. So I don’t have global search or trending topics. I also don’t make it easy to stumble upon random users. But I do have replies, which by default will currently go out as push notifications if you have the iPhone app installed. It’s that area that I should focus my attention.</p>
<p>Two options that come to mind for minimizing abuse in replies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t allow replies from people you aren’t following. This solves the problem, but it comes at the expense of discussion. It removes the accessibility that many people love about Twitter’s asynchronous following model.</li>
<li>Quarantine or attempt to classify replies so they don’t bubble up in your timeline or as notifications by default. This would be like an over-aggressive email spam filter. Difficult to get right and possibly routed around by clever microbloggers.</li>
</ul>
<p>After listening to Marco and David, and reviewing the full scope of what I’ve been trying to build, I’m pretty concerned about this. I’m looking at <a href="https://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, and other metrics internal to my app for judging content and suspicious user accounts, but I may be a little in over my head on this issue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting back in September 2014, I added microblog posts to this site. These are defined as <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">short posts without a title</a>. They have their own RSS feed, and they’re automatically cross-posted to Twitter and App.net.</p>
<p>In that time, I’ve posted about 300 microblog posts and about 230 essays, although many of my longer posts are really just a few paragraphs and a quote. I still find the microblog format very convenient for quick thoughts, or a series of related posts like <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/newcoffee">all my coffee stops</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve also switched from Gaug.es to WordPress.com stats. While I agree with Ben Brooks that <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/10/death-to-analytics/">analytics can be a distraction</a>, I still like finding new referrers and having a sense of what posts have resonated with people. Not that it effects what I write about, though.</p>
<p>The key to blogging is still consistency and passion. Write about the things you care about, regularly, and the internet is a big enough place that there can be an audience for even obscure topics.</p>
<p>That’s the theme I’m trying to apply to my new <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable podcast</a>, too. I talk about microblogging, coffee shops, client work, but more important than any of that is the routine of recording it. The short nature of the podcast is itself kind of the story.</p>
<p>I’m at episode 15 now and have loved working on it. I now expect that all of these components of my blog — the longer posts, the microblog posts, and the companion Timetable episodes — will be something I do for years to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The folks at Realmac have been <a href="http://blog.typed.com/">blogging about their progress with Typed.com</a>, a new blogging platform that successfully raised $120k on Indiegogo last year. In the <a href="http://blog.typed.com/posts/typed-monthly-report-january-2016">latest monthly report</a>, they announce a new free tier:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With this new free tier, people can sign-up, use the service, take their time. They can blog for free, for as long as they want, and when they need or want the extra features we offer they can upgrade to a paid account. We also think this will be free marketing for the service, the more blog out there that are hosted with Typed.com then more people will find out about the service.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>This blog is in the spirit of <a href="https://open.buffer.com/">Buffer’s open blog</a> or <a href="https://ghost.baremetrics.com/">Ghost’s Baremetrics reports</a>. It’s especially great to see a company sharing numbers when they know they still have a lot of growth ahead of them to get where they want to be.</p>
<p>If you’d like to start a new blog but aren’t sure where to host it, <a href="http://www.typed.com/">check it out</a>. Typed.com has a well-designed admin UI that is refreshingly simple compared to much of the more bloated web software out there.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to use Typed.com as a microblog. I pointed to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/microblogging-with-typed-com.html">some tips for this last year</a>. Since the title of a post can’t be blank on Typed.com, I suggest using a date/time for the title. My new microblog platform is smart about treating those kind of short posts correctly when reading from an RSS feed.</p>
