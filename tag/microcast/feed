				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting back in September 2014, I added microblog posts to this site. These are defined as <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">short posts without a title</a>. They have their own RSS feed, and they’re automatically cross-posted to Twitter and App.net.</p>
<p>In that time, I’ve posted about 300 microblog posts and about 230 essays, although many of my longer posts are really just a few paragraphs and a quote. I still find the microblog format very convenient for quick thoughts, or a series of related posts like <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/newcoffee">all my coffee stops</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve also switched from Gaug.es to WordPress.com stats. While I agree with Ben Brooks that <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/10/death-to-analytics/">analytics can be a distraction</a>, I still like finding new referrers and having a sense of what posts have resonated with people. Not that it effects what I write about, though.</p>
<p>The key to blogging is still consistency and passion. Write about the things you care about, regularly, and the internet is a big enough place that there can be an audience for even obscure topics.</p>
<p>That’s the theme I’m trying to apply to my new <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable podcast</a>, too. I talk about microblogging, coffee shops, client work, but more important than any of that is the routine of recording it. The short nature of the podcast is itself kind of the story.</p>
<p>I’m at episode 15 now and have loved working on it. I now expect that all of these components of my blog — the longer posts, the microblog posts, and the companion Timetable episodes — will be something I do for years to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I started a new short-form podcast called <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable</a>. Each episode is 3-5 minutes. It has been really fun to record the show because I can try new things without investing too much time.</p>
<p>One goal from the very beginning was to record from iOS so that I could easily record outside the house. I wanted not just the flexibility to be away from my computer, but a stereo microphone that could capture some of the surrounding environment, to give it a more informal feel. (I’m actually cheating in some cases and using multiple tracks, to make editing easier, but I think the effect works. All the episodes have been exported to mono so far, though.)</p>
<p>I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072DKYFO">this cheap iPhone microphone</a> for testing — only $10 when I ordered it! — and figured after some experiments with my iPhone 4S, I would invest in something new. I liked it enough that I’m still using the mic with my 5S via a Lightning cable adapter. I’m also using a foam pop filter that I already had from a previous old mic.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2016/microphone_with_filter.jpg" width="550" height="244" alt="Microphone" border="0" /></center></p>
<p>This may be the single best value in a tech gadget I’ve ever purchased. Total cost for producing the podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072DKYFO">Microphone</a>: $10</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8">Ferrite</a>: $20</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8">Workflow</a>: $3 (for MP3 conversion)</li>
<li>Domain name: $120 (.fm domains are expensive)</li>
</ul>
<p>I certainly didn’t invent the idea of a “microcast”. There are other good short podcasts, such as <a href="http://bitesize.tech/">Bite Size Tech</a>. But I’m happy to see even more people trying out the idea. <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/">Michael</a> even started a new podcast called <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/microcast/">Driftwood</a> to chronicle the development of <a href="https://github.com/LK64076007A/driftwood">his Jekyll template</a> for microcasts.</p>
<p>Ferrite also continues to impress. It’s a very high quality iOS app and is competitive with Mac multi-track audio editors. For a good introduction, check out <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/">Jason Snell’s review</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m launching a new podcast today. For a while I&#8217;ve felt like there could be something interesting in a very short podcast, where I talk a little about what I&#8217;m working on or thinking about throughout the week. Each episode is going to be just 3-5 minutes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/">Timetable</a>. I&#8217;ve published 3 episodes, and have a 4th that will go out later today. I think of it as a &#8220;microcast&#8221;, complementing the informal nature of my microblog posts. And just as I have longer essays on my weblog, of course I&#8217;ll continue to explore larger topics for indie Mac and iOS developers on <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> with Daniel Jalkut.</p>
<p>If you check it out, let me know what you think at <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">manton@manton.org</a>. Thanks!</p>
