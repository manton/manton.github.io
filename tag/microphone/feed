				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ll be in San Francisco for WWDC, although as usual in recent years I won&#8217;t be staying all week. While out there I&#8217;ll be attending AltConf and other events, recording a podcast or two, and catching up on some writing.</p>
<p>I probably <em>should</em> take my MacBook Pro to code on projects, but I never have time. And I&#8217;ve been working so much lately, I probably need a break from Xcode for a few days. So I&#8217;m going to travel light this time and only take my iPad Pro with me.</p>
<p>I used my iPad Pro often when working <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">from coffee shops</a> and <a href="http://www.manton.org/libraries-austin">libraries</a> earlier this year. I think I have a pretty good sense of what I&#8217;m productive with on it. iPhone and Mac app coding is out, but email, chat, writing blog posts, and even light web site maintenance are all fine, and those are the kind of things I do while traveling.</p>
<p>That leaves podcast recording as the only question mark, but actually I&#8217;ve recorded every episode of <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable</a> using my iPhone specifically so that I could get used to recording away from my office. I wrote <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/02/microphone-and-microcast-details.html">a few months ago</a> about my microphone for Timetable. I&#8217;ll do the same thing when Daniel and I record our WWDC thoughts after the keynote, with editing on the iPad Pro.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited about the conference. I&#8217;m looking forward to catching up with folks, the news from Apple, and — because I won&#8217;t even have my laptop — a bit of a break from the stress of thinking I should be programming.</p>
