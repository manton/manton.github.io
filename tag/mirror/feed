				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been blogging here for 13 years. If you take any random post from that first year, the majority of the links to other web sites are broken. The default outcome for any site that isn&#8217;t maintained — including the one you&#8217;re reading right now — is for it to vanish. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">Permanence</a> doesn&#8217;t exist on the web.</p>
<p>We can <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">solve this</a>, but it will take time. For now I think mirroring our writing is a great solution, to guard against domain names expiring and other inevitable failures. But where to mirror to?</p>
<p>Only 2 companies keep coming to mind: WordPress.com and GitHub. I believe both will last for decades, maybe even 100 years, and both embrace the open web in a way that most other centralized web sites do not.</p>
<p>Even though I self-host this weblog on WordPress, I&#8217;ve chosen to mirror to GitHub because of their focus on simple, static publishing via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. It has the best chance of running for a long time without intervention.</p>
<p>I exported all of manton.org with the <a href="http://www.httrack.com/">httrack</a> command-line tool and checked it into GitHub, with a CNAME for <a href="http://mirror.manton.org/">mirror.manton.org</a>. It works perfectly. I still need to automate this process so that it updates regularly, but I&#8217;m very happy to finally have a complete mirror for the first time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right after publishing <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/04/write_locally_mirror.html">yesterday’s post on mirroring content</a>, I added a link to IndieWebCamp’s <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE</a>, a project from Tantek Çelik to provide a framework for mirroring posts to different services. It looks like that group is doing great work to identify microformats that will make this a more open standard.</p>
<p>Noah Read also rolled his own solution for writing posts on his site first and then letting them flow to Twitter, App.net, Flickr, and other services. He calls them <a href="http://noahread.net/blog/snippets">Snippets</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Microblogging and social sharing will survive, whether or not the current players do. So I wanted to take control of the things I publish on these networks, without abandoning the great things only they can provide, the conversations and reactions to what is shared. So Snippets are the way I will post to these services from now on.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Check out <a href="http://noahread.net/snippets">Noah’s snippets feed</a>. I especially like the name. As a programmer I’m used to thinking “code snippet” when I hear it, but with enough use it’d be easy to reclaim its normal non-code definition.</p>
