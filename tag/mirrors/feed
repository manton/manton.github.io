				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peter Merholz writes about <a href="http://peterme.com/archives/00000300.html">his first contribution to the Mirror Project</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I went to the mirror, and saw I could frame myself in between the two brothers talking, and snapped the photo you see on the site. My dad is older than Bertin, and in infinitely better shape. I wondered just what dad was *thinking* as he was looking at his little brother, who probably tagged along with him on the streets of Cleveland, who probably looked up to him in that way that younger brothers do, and now, as they enter twilight years, the younger brother is clearly going to pass long before the older.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/mirror/?id=3454">I submitted a photo</a> to the Mirror Project earlier this year, too, but it doesn&#8217;t have an interesting story behind it. I had browsed through the Mirror Project site earlier that day or week, and afterwards whenever I saw my reflection in something I thought about the site. It&#8217;s a cool idea. If you like what you see, you can even subscribe to an <a href="http://www.mirrorproject.com/mirrorproject.rss">RSS feed of the latest submissions</a>.</p>
