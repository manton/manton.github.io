<p>You have that feeling when hanging out with friends — everyone snapping pictures of their surroundings, of people, events, food, anything — that <em>photo sharing should be better</em>. That years later, you should be able to go back to that time, to see the best photos collected together from several people. And not just photos, but maps of where you were, and text to describe its significance.</p>
<p>One afternoon before Çingleton in 2012, this subject came up as Jonathan Hays and I were taking photos around Montreal. It seemed remarkable and disappointing to us that there was no easy way to put those photos together. And I liked the idea of buildling a new app around photos, with the same themes of curation and preserving past events that are so important to my other Riverfold products.</p>
<p>So we let the idea sit in the back of our minds, and later we wrote a little code as time allowed. At <a href="http://blog.app.net/2013/06/11/app-net-hackathon-recap-2/">the App.net hackathon before WWDC 2013</a> we dove into the project in earnest, figuring out how it would sync, then over the summer took some more time to think through the user experience.</p>
<p>Sharing a single photo has been done a hundred times on iOS. Instagram was an important app to nail the timeline UI, and <a href="http://favd.net/">Favd</a> is currently my favorite way to post and browse new photos (it’s really great). But hardly anyone has even attempted to tackle photo curation, group sharing, and publishing, let alone gotten it right. Sunlit 1.0 is our first pass at this and we couldn’t be more excited about trying to solve a new problem with photos.</p>
<p>They say you should spend money on experiences — on memories, not things. Sunlit helps you put those memories together, share them as a group, and rediscover them when it matters. The first version <a href="http://sunlit.io/">will ship tomorrow</a>. I hope you like it.</p>
