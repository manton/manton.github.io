				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1167373/textexpander_4_adds_features_leaves_mac_app_store.html">TextExpander 4 shipped this week</a>, and with the update it breaks from the Mac App Store and instead requires customers to buy directly. TextExpander is the first popular app I&#8217;ve seen to do it.</p>
<p>Moom is another one that actively encourages users to move away from the store. Recently on launch Moom displayed a news window that included this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Apple has <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1167055/sandboxing_deadline_arrives_what_it_means_for_apple_developers_and_you.html">activated sandboxing</a> on the Mac App Store; under the sandboxing rules, we can no longer add new features to the App Store version of Moom (we can only fix bugs). However, we have a method by which you can migrate (<strong>at no cost</strong>) to our direct sales version of Moom, which <strong>has no such limitations</strong>. For details on how sandboxing affects our apps, and how to migrate to the direct sales version, please <a href="http://manytricks.com/sandbox">read this article</a> on our blog.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even Panic – frustrated with the long approval times for Coda 2.0.1 – is experimenting with how best to let Mac App Store customers migrate to the direct version. <a href="http://twitter.com/panic/statuses/215505347371220992">See this tweet and screenshot</a> from Cabel Sasser.</p>
<p>This has been a theme on the last couple episodes of <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>. Daniel Jalkut and I talked about how we feel about sandboxing after WWDC, and more on my decision to migrate Clipstart out of the store. Things are getting better in Mountain Lion, and I&#8217;ll revisit my decision next year, but for now I think I made the right call to focus on work outside the Mac App Store.</p>
