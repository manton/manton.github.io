				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://eggfreckles.net">Thomas Brand has changed his blog</a> to let short link-style posts essentially expire off his site, with no permanent archive:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;For the last five months I have been practicing a new way of blogging. Articles of reference receive a permalink with a link on my homepage and a link in my RSS feed. Quotations and comments are displayed in full on the homepage and in the RSS feed, but do not receive a permalink of their own. As I write, older quotations and comments are pushed down the homepage and lost from the site forever.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>And since that post may go away, I’ll quote a little bit more:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I feel like disposable blogging lends itself to a more carefree publication, not only for me but my audience as well. When you pick up a magazine, you don&#8217;t expect to have access to every back issue.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/03/28/silofreeIsNotEnough.html">Dave Winer has been working on</a> his own new blogging platform:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;There haven&#8217;t been new features in blogging in a long time. Where&#8217;s the excitement? It looks to me like there&#8217;s been no effort made to factor the user interface, to simplify and group functionality so the first-time user isn&#8217;t confronted with the full feature set, left on his or her own to figure out where to go to create a new post or edit an existing one.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think the next 5 years of blogging are going to be a lot more varied than the previous 5 years. Medium-style UIs, Twitter-like microblogs, and of course traditional WordPress blogs, plus the work Dave is doing and whatever else people build as blogging takes off again. I&#8217;m looking forward to shipping an app that contributes something to all of this, too.</p>
