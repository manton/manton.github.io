				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I somehow recorded 4 podcast episodes this week. We just published <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/05/episode-233-actually-i-am-a-little-worried/">episode 233 of Core Intuition</a>, where Daniel Jalkut and I talk about the announcements from Google I/O and compare the latest Swift 3 news to our experience going through previous Apple transitions. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Manton and Daniel react to Google’s I/O keynote, and weigh the threat of Allo to iMessage. They celebrate Apple’s WWDC promotion of 3rd party events, and the increasing speed of App Store reviews. Finally, they reflect on the announced delay in Swift 3’s planned ABI stability, and Daniel’s sudden FUD about embracing Swift.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was a big week for the NBA, too, with the first couple games of the east and west conference finals. On <a href="http://technicalfoul.fm/episode-05-therapy-for-manton/">the latest Technical Foul</a>, Ben Thompson and I recap round 2, especially the Spurs loss in 6 games to the Thunder:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Ben and Manton are back geeking out about the NBA. This week we talk Manton through the Spurs loss, discuss OKC versus the Warriors, and whether the Cavs are good enough.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, I published 2 episodes of my microcast Timetable earlier in the week. <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/05/episode-22-grumpy-about-everything/">Episode 22</a> was about dealing with recent stress — trying to see the bigger picture and focus on the good things. <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/05/episode-23-when-a-product-is-over/">Episode 23</a> was about how to tell when it&#8217;s time to move on from a failed product.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/04/libraries-for-30-days-wrap-up.html">my wrap-up post about working from libraries</a>, spending so much time commuting all over the city (and outside the city) had really burned me out. Over the last couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve overcompensated a little and have been working from home almost exclusively. I&#8217;ve also been catching up on client work.</p>
<p>I recorded <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/05/episode-21-the-right-work-balance/">a new episode of Timetable</a> this morning to try to capture this change in work focus. Talking into the microphone for 5 minutes actually helped me assess where I&#8217;m at with my projects, and what I need to adjust to continue to make this blog and my podcasts a priority.</p>
<p>And speaking of podcasts, <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Ben Thompson</a> and I published <a href="http://technicalfoul.fm/episode-03-chaos/">episode 3 of Technical Foul</a> last night. We talk a lot about the wild last minute of Spurs/Thunder game 2, which I&#8217;m still thinking about even a couple days later.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It used to be that I would stay up until midnight working in Xcode. This year, it&#8217;s more likely that I&#8217;ll stay up until midnight watching late NBA games played on the west coast. I&#8217;ve loved this season, from Golden State&#8217;s record wins to being able to visit San Antonio a few times to catch Spurs games.</p>
<p>So why not do a basketball podcast? Today, <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Ben Thompson</a> and I released the first episode of <a href="http://technicalfoul.fm/">TECHnical Foul</a>. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Welcome to the first episode of the TECHnical Foul, in which two wildly unqualified tech geeks geek out about the NBA. In this episode we debate 96 Bulls vs the 16 Warriors, Kobe’s final game, what makes the Spurs great, whether the Spurs can beat the Warriors, and a quick overview of the first round.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We had a lot of fun recording this. If you&#8217;re a basketball fan, or just need some variety in your podcast subscriptions, I hope you enjoy it.</p>
