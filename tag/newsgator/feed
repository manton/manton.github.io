				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Great post from Brent Simmons, <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/05/10/what_happened_at_newsgator">recalling his time at NewsGator</a>. On trying to get Nick Bradbury to join them at Sepia Labs, the spin-off that was building Glassboard:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I loved working with Nick in the past, and — even though Nick was an iPhone user and Delphi programmer — I wanted him as our Android developer. Nick was not eager to be on the NewsGator payroll again, but he accepted since we were spinning out into a separate company. And he quickly turned into a great Android developer, as we all knew he would.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s plenty more, about the different stages the company went through from Brent’s perspective. I love posts like this. It’s important to capture the history and culture of tech companies, before our memory fades. And it’s not unlike what Brent has done on a bigger scale for his podcast <a href="http://therecord.co">The Record</a> with Chris Parrish.</p>
