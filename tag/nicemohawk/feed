				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://nicemohawk.com/blog/2013/03/making-the-app-store-a-nicer-place/">Ben Lachman has some good suggestions</a> after <a href="http://www.manton.org/2013/03/app_store_old_app.html">my post</a> and <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2013/03/21/purging-the-back-catalog/">David Smith’s</a> on what to do with abandoned apps, saying that apps should be more clearly labelled as “abandoned”. Which device you’re using could also have an impact on search results:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Search results could be weighted by the device you are using quite heavily. Just like how on iPhone you don’t see iPad-only apps when searching the app store; on iPhone 5 you should be very unlikely to see apps that only support 3.5-inch screens.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Makes sense to me. Also check out his comment at the end, that kids these days may have a very difficult time revisiting the classic apps from today, 20 years from now.</p>
