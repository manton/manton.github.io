				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Much has been made <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/02/apple-watch-is-slow-for-now.html">of the Apple Watch not being fast enough</a>. It’s too slow for full iPhone-like apps, of course, but that doesn’t bother me because I think the watch is <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/apple-watch-still-pretty-great.html">pretty great at its core features</a>. But I’ve noticed that it’s slow even for some of the simple stuff, and I don’t think this can be blamed on hardware alone.</p>
<p>Take notifications, for example. There are several distinct steps to notifications after you receive one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tapping a notification.</li>
<li>Waiting for it to load, which is an animated transition.</li>
<li>Optionally scrolling to the bottom to read it all.</li>
<li>Actually tapping Dismiss to get rid of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a tiny lag between all of these. I frequently can’t scroll right away, as if it’s not responsive until the animation completes. The Dismiss button also doesn’t seem to be enabled immediately, requiring a 2nd tap before it “clicks”.</p>
<p>I bet these are solvable with a software update. Shorter animated transitions or pre-loading notification text might go a long way to improve the experience.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/12/apple-watch-follow-up">Stephen Hackett posted</a> an Apple Watch follow-up recently. He has mostly stopped wearing it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The Apple Watch can do a lot of neat things, and I miss its fitness tracking, but so much of it just doesn&#8217;t fit my lifestyle anymore. It&#8217;s not super useful for work, apps are still miserably slow and at times, its an additional distraction.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Apple Watch is a very personal device. It&#8217;s okay that it&#8217;s not for everyone. There&#8217;s no network effect; the watch isn&#8217;t better or worse if other people don&#8217;t use it. And it&#8217;s even okay if most of the apps are too slow to bother with. Fitness tracking, notifications, the time — for me, those 3 simple features are enough.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2015/12/17/apple-watch-revisited">Casey Liss also writes</a> that notifications have been one of the most important features, letting him keep his iPhone ringer off:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The Apple Watch has allowed my iPhone to transition from being a <em>personal</em> device to being a <em>private</em> one. That’s a really profound change. More so than I expected.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Once every couple of months, I leave the house in a hurry and forget to put my Apple Watch on. I survive without it, of course, but I do miss it. After not wearing a watch for most of my life, it&#8217;s weird now if I don&#8217;t have the Apple Watch with me. I expect to use it for years to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Smith says to <a href="http://david-smith.org/blog/2014/02/28/please-dont-push-me/">not bother the user with alerts on first launch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I have just sorted through the App Store and settled on trying out your app. I open it up and you immediately ask if you can send me Push Notifications? I have no context about what these are going to be used for or why they might be useful to me.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. For <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a>, we only prompt to enable push notifications after you’ve chosen to enable sharing for a story. While it might be useful to have push notifications for everyone, by waiting until we <em>really</em> need it, most users are never bothered with the alert. And it forced us to focus on specific and valuable uses of notifications, such as sending a push notification when someone subscribes to your shared story.</p>
