				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I forgot to mention a few weeks back that I was a guest on <a href="http://iphreaksshow.com/039-iphreaks-show-subscription-apis-for-recurring-revenue-with-manton-reece/">the iPhreaks Show podcast</a>. The format is a panel of regulars and usually one guest, making it feel more like a roundtable discussion. They had me on to talk about subscription pricing: charging every month for your app or service.</p>
<p>Some of what we talked about was covered in 2 talks I gave last year about subscriptions, at NSConference and CocoaConf Dallas. I’ve finally pulled together the slides from these talks and put the latest version from CocoaConf <a href="http://www.manton.org/misc/Subscription_APIs_CocoaConf_2013.pdf">here as a PDF</a> (17 MB). It’s different than the NSConference one, but I think works better standalone. You can still <a href="http://my.nsconference.com">purchase the videos from NSConference 2013</a> to get my talk and many other great ones.</p>
<p>This week I was also on <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/41-manton-reece/">the Release Notes podcast</a> with Joe Cieplinski and Charles Perry. They do a great job each episode focusing on something from the business side of running an indie software company, and they’ve had some excellent guests as well. From the show notes for episode 41:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We talk about creating products vs. services, changing products from free to paid, and the advantages and challenges of subscription pricing. Manton also shares his experience in creating apps like Sunlit that build on top of other services like Twitter and App.net, his recent foray into freemium pricing, and the launch of the new Core Intuition Jobs Board.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you enjoy <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, I think you’ll really like Release Notes. Let me know if you have any feedback on the show.</p>

		<title>Pricing changes and Watermark Mobile 1.1</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I tend to be pretty stubborn about not changing my price. <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> sat at $10 for two years before I finally lowered it, and the price for <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart</a> has never changed from the $29 it shipped at. I think there is something to be said for price consistency so that users feel like software is stable and doesn’t have arbitrary value. (Many people disagree with this, which is why I’d classify my opinion as equal parts instinct and stubbornness rather than a proven formula for success.)</p>
<p>But I’m making two pricing changes today: Tweet Library goes up to $7.99, and Watermark down to just $4/month. I’ve come to believe that the previous price changes for both products were too far in either direction. I hope this corrects that. In the case of Watermark, I will eventually be offering different plans at higher tiers for more storage, and want the entry-level price to be as appealing as possible. (All existing Watermark customers have been switched to the discounted plan.)</p>
<p>The little <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/watermark-mobile/id566886320?mt=8">iOS app for Watermark</a> has also been updated to version 1.1 and now features auto-renewing subscriptions. This means you can sign up directly in the iOS app and have your iTunes account charged each month. Watermark Mobile launched mostly as a convenient search interface, but it should now start receiving more regular updates.</p>
<p>For another recent discussion about pricing, check out part 3 of <a href="http://kevinhoctor.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-future-of-software-pricing.html">Kevin Hoctor’s excellent write-up</a> of talks from NSConference.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Daniel&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/ and I have now recorded 13 episodes of Core Intuition. Each time I go through these stages of denial and acceptance:</p>
<h1><em>During recording.</em> Great! This will be our best show yet.</h1>
<h1><em>Hours later.</em> I wish I had said &#8220;X&#8221; instead of &#8220;Y&#8221;.</h1>
<h1><em>The next day.</em> Disappointed. Maybe I won&#8217;t even bother to edit it.</h1>
<h1><em>Listening.</em> Hey, this isn&#8217;t bad stuff.</h1>
<h1><em>Editing.</em> Pretty good! We made some good points, had a few laughs. Success!</h1>
<p>Our latest episode is out now on the &#8220;Core Intuition web site&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/. We talk about getting started, making mistakes, business, pushing to 1.0, and the upcoming &#8220;NSConference&#8221;:http://www.nsconference.com/.</p>
<p>A special thank you to our listeners. The feedback is very encouraging.</p>
