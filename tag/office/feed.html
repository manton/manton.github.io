<p>I also like &#8220;episode 19 of their podcast&#8221;:http://37signals.com/podcast/#episode19, which is edited from a live recording of a planning session for Rework. My first impression of Rework was that it was <em>too</em> finely edited &mdash; that to get to the essence they threw away too much material. I wanted to hear more case studies from their business, approaches that worked or didn&#8217;t, and lessons learned.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve flipped through the book again, a few months later, and it holds up. I don&#8217;t know if it was intentional or not, but the lack of filler text gives it a certain timelessness. Each chapter is one core argument, and whether that topic resonates with the reader or not depends entirely on what you and I bring to it from our own job experiences.</p>
