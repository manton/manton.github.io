				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week Traci asked me if I had heard about the animator who had died. Now of the 220 feeds I subscribe to in NetNewsWire, a full 60 of those are in a group called &#8220;Animation and Comics&#8221;, so I should have heard about any news from a variety of artist blogs or industry sources. But I&#8217;ve had my head down working on a number of programming projects &#8212; both Rails and Cocoa and just keeping up with the never-ending flood of email and Basecamp messages &#8212; so that NetNewsWire group was closed, and I was sadly ignorant.</p>
<p>My first question to her: &#8220;Was it Ollie?&#8221;</p>
<p>And of course it was. Ollie Johnston passed away at the age of 95, the last of Disney&#8217;s &#8220;Nine Old Men&#8221;. See the <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/disney/ollie-johnston-1912-2008">epic Cartoon Brew post</a> for more. I had <a href="http://www.manton.org/2004/09/frank_thomas_passes.html">blogged about the death of his friend Frank Thomas</a> in 2004, and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2002/07/ward_kimball_one.html">also of colleague Ward Kimball</a> in 2002.</p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t know me very well, and even many who do, I&#8217;ll let you in on a little secret. One day my boss is going to wonder why I don&#8217;t answer his emails, and it will be because I&#8217;ve thrown the computer in the trash, set my USB devices on fire, and returned to the first passion of my life.</p>
<p>Sure, I have an old-school animation desk (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/36599819/">old office 2005</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/1558857105/">new office this year</a>, next to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/2265209824/">computer stuff</a>) and a bunch of paper and sharpened pencils to play with. Sure, I&#8217;ll still always love building software, designing user interfaces, and am grateful for the friends I have at work and in the Mac development community. Sure, I can&#8217;t support a family and giant mortgage doing silly portraits on the street corner.</p>
<p>But damn it. Ollie Johnston died.</p>
