				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many developers, I&#8217;ve spent the morning looking over the <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift open source release</a>. I continue to be intrigued and look forward to working Swift into more of my routine.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/12/episode-209-we-need-a-grand-gesture/">today&#8217;s Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I talked about Swift for about half of the 50-minute episode. We recorded the episode yesterday afternoon, before the open source announcement, so we&#8217;ll be following up next week on everything that has changed. I bet there will be some more progress in Swift web server frameworks by then, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a previous episode of &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/, number 14, Daniel and I talked about open source. One LGPL tool I use in Wii Transfer is called FFmpeg, a very popular video conversion project that forms the base of many video web sites, as well as the Mac QuickTime component, Perian.</p>
<p>In the latest Wii Transfer I updated to a new version of FFmpeg, which it turns out had a major bug: &#8220;broken audio for 8-bit input sources&#8221;:https://roundup.mplayerhq.hu/roundup/ffmpeg/issue582. Of course I am including the fix in a bug fix update to Wii Transfer (still &#8220;beta in the forums&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/forums/), but not before many customers were hit by the problem.</p>
<p>Not to look a gift horse in the mouth, but it reminds me of one annoyance with FFmpeg: no releases. You basically just follow trunk, and if there&#8217;s a bug, sorry. This is understandable. It&#8217;s open source, after all, and the developers don&#8217;t owe you anything. But at the same time, it&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;ve moved to Perian-only in my new app, and left the FFmpeg trunk and other similar open source command line tool projects behind. With Perian I can track specific major releases and know that someone has tested them. QTKit is good enough now on Leopard that I feel comfortable basing on app on it.</p>
<p>Daniel also mentioned in passing that violators of open source licenses are likely to get away with it. I think that&#8217;s largely true, but I found that the FFmpeg developer base has a pretty keen eye to this issue. If they notice that commercial software is using FFmpeg or MEncoder or other portions inappropriately, they will list the software in their &#8220;hall of shame&#8221;:http://www.ffmpeg.org/shame.html.</p>
