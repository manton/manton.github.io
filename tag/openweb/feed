				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to mostly let John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/17/apple-tv-and-the-web">have the last word</a> on the Apple TV vs. the web debate, because I could write about this every day and my readers would run away before I run out of material. I&#8217;m glad John addressed the Mac vs. the command-line argument, though, because it didn&#8217;t seem quite right to me either. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The difference is that the command-line-less Mac was intended to <em>replace</em> command-line-based computers. The GUI relegated the command-line interface to a permanent tiny niche. Apple TV and Apple Watch aren’t like that at all — they’re not meant to replace any device you already use to access the open web.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the most hopeful part of the Apple ecosystem as it relates to the web. Apple&#8217;s other platforms really do have a great web experience. Remember when web sites were faster and worked better on a PC than a Mac? If anything, the opposite is true now.</p>
<p>One of the themes I keep hearing is that a &#8220;web browser&#8221; on a TV will make for a poor user experience, so don&#8217;t bother. I tried to correct that misunderstanding in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/the-web-without-html.html">this post</a>; it&#8217;s not about standalone Safari, it&#8217;s about web technologies that could be used in native apps. But ignoring that, I think everyone too easily forgets what the mobile web was like before the iPhone.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, from the original iPhone introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;We wanted the best web browser in the world on our phone. Not a baby web browser or a WAP browser — a <em>real</em> browser. [&#8230;] It is the first fully usable HTML browser on a phone.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>That was a breakthrough. I believe the same evolution is possible on tvOS — to include parts of the open web and do it with a great user experience. You can start by weaving it together inside native apps. (I <a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6066362971586560">filed a bug with Apple</a> yesterday with a suggestion. It was marked as a duplicate.)</p>
<p>The web is at a fascinating, pivotal time right now. It has been shaken up by centralized publishing, closed platforms, and now content blockers. Users no longer value the concepts that made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> special. The web can still have a strong future, but we have to <em>try something</em>, and we have to try it on every platform we can.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven&#8217;t paid too much attention to ad blocking until this week, even though I had been running the iOS 9 beta since WWDC. Several content blockers were released yesterday, like Marco Arment&#8217;s new app <a href="https://peace.land">Peace</a>. Marco writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;You won’t believe how fast browsing the web can be without the bloated, privacy-invading junk that too many publishers force on you <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/08/11/ad-blocking-ethics">without your knowledge or consent</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web">Nilay Patel has an essay</a> framing the issue as a fight between Apple, Google, and Facebook, with the web as a casualty:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;And with iOS 9 and content blockers, what you&#8217;re seeing is Apple&#8217;s attempt to fully drive the knife into Google&#8217;s revenue platform. iOS 9 includes a refined search that auto-suggests content and that can search inside apps, pulling content away from Google and users away from the web, it allows users to block ads, and it offers publishers salvation in the form of Apple News, inside of which Apple will happily display (unblockable!) ads, and even sell them on publishers&#8217; behalf for just a 30 percent cut.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m conflicted on this. I hate ads, and I think good publishers can adapt, but I&#8217;m also concerned that some progress we&#8217;ve made in native apps and user experience could be offset by steps <em>back</em> in open platforms. The health of the open web is more important than any one company, including Apple.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/thefaj/status/644273497271869440">On Twitter</a>, Alex Fajkowski responded to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/every-device-needs-the-web.html">my blog post about tvOS</a> with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;They have access to the open web—NSURLSession exists. HTML rendering is inappropriate for the watch and tv.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I disagree with both of those sentences. Maybe Alex didn&#8217;t read my full post, because I wrote that web <em>services</em> are not enough. HTML and links and URLs are equally important parts of the open web. NSURLSession gets you web services but nothing else.</p>
<p>(As an aside, HTML turns out to be a pretty useful format for styling text, too. Why wouldn&#8217;t you want to use it for iTunes movie descriptions on the TV, for example? That seems completely appropriate.)</p>
<p>Think about the full scope of the internet. What percentage of content is available via web services — that is, structured data that can be parsed and displayed with a custom, native UI — compared to all the traditional, HTML-based web sites? You&#8217;ll find that there is an almost unimaginably large number of that latter kind of web site, and the only way to access and display that content is with an HTML renderer.</p>
<p>Now imagine a world with only native apps. You&#8217;d need custom apps and web services for different kinds of content, just as we have native Twitter or Instagram apps today, but we&#8217;d need these for many thousands of categories: tvOS with TVML, recipe or cooking apps with FOODML, and so on. Eventually, having so many formats would get unmanageable. We&#8217;d need to invent a general purpose format that could accommodate many app formats, and (surprise!) that general format would look a lot like HTML. Why break old content and essentially reboot the web, when we already have a capable format in HTML?</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s no immediate risk of getting to that hypothetical native-only future. But when a company with the size and influence of Apple has 4 major platforms and only 2 of them have access to the open web, that should give us pause. Let&#8217;s reflect on how this plays out, so we can get back on track if the web does become marginalized.</p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/16/manton-every-device">John Gruber commented</a> that these new devices don&#8217;t <em>need</em> the web at all, comparing it to the original Mac shipping without a command line interface. I realized while reading his closing paragraph that my own blog post had been poorly titled, and so the whole point too easily misunderstood. John wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Or it could be that Apple has decided never to open WebKit to developers on Apple TV. Either way, it won’t affect Apple TV’s success, and everything will be OK.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple TV&#8217;s success doesn&#8217;t change my argument. My Apple TV dev kit arrives on Friday, I&#8217;m going to build an app for it, and I can&#8217;t wait to watch Apple&#8217;s latest platform take off. When I wrote that the Apple TV &#8220;needs&#8221; the web I didn&#8217;t mean that it would be crippled and unsuccessful without it. I simply meant that the web <em>should</em> be there in some form, even if limited.</p>
<p>(It doesn&#8217;t even have to be Safari. There just needs to be enough web technologies to make some part of the open web possible. Again, that means web services, HTML, and links.)</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/15/ppk-stop-pushing-web-forward">John Gruber also wrote</a> about web apps and native apps, and what each should focus on:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Native apps can’t out-web the web, and web apps should embrace that.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s good advice. There are plenty of important tasks for the web community that should be top priorities, such as encouraging a return to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/evan-williams-on-indie-web-sites.html">independent publishing</a> and trying to fix the <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">lack of redundancy</a>. The web will always be playing catch-up with native apps for user experience, but the web will always be <em>ahead</em> as a distributed, open publishing platform. And that is such an important feature, it should be available on as many devices as possible.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2015/09/09/mediums-evan-williams-to-publishers-your-website-is-toast/">From a rough transcript</a> of an interview with Evan Williams:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The idea won’t be to start a website. That will be dead. The individual website won’t matter. The Internet is not going to be about billions of people going to millions of websites. It will be about getting it from centralized websites.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m concerned about this. Evan is reading into the current rise of centralized services and thinking it&#8217;s more than a short-term trend. But I believe strongly that the open web will bounce back.</p>
<p>Putting all of our writing in one place like Medium goes against our hope of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">permanence</a>, because there&#8217;s no guarantee Medium will be around in 20 years, and so all of that content will disappear from the internet if it fails. At least with independent sites and custom domain names we have a chance. We have control, so it&#8217;s in our hands to succeed or fail, not left to the whims of Silicon Valley startups.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a widely-linked <a href="https://medium.com/@dlpasco/apple-tv-a-world-without-webkit-5c428a64a6dd">post to Medium</a>, Daniel Pasco writes about the problem of not having WebKit available on tvOS:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Webviews are the duct tape of the mobile world. I’d estimate that 50% to 80% of the major apps out there use webviews somewhere within their apps. Apple’s Mail app uses webviews for your email messages, because webviews can style and render the content very efficiently. NetNewsWire uses them prolifically, particularly in a few features we haven’t enabled in the shipping version yet.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve argued on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> that even with the Apple Watch — as silly as it might seem to want to browse the web on your wrist — there should still be some basic access to the web. If not a full browser, at least a webview so that developers can style short content.</p>
<p><a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2015/09/12/everything-but-the-web/">Daniel Jalkut suggests</a> a related compromise for the Apple TV:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I propose that Apple could strike a compromise that would serve those ambitions while also <em>supporting the tasteful handling of web content</em> in apps. How? By forbidding network access to web content. Apps themselves could still access the network, but not from within their web views.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is much better, but I think we should aim higher, since giving up on the web seems to admit early defeat to what Daniel acknowledges is probably WebKit&#8217;s politically-motivated omission. The web might not be the most usable medium on all devices, but it is arguably the most important one. Just because we all love native apps doesn&#8217;t mean we should trade in the significant value that the web provides, especially for independent writing and a permanence that can outlive silos and platforms.</p>
<p>Apple has 4 major platforms now: iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and the Mac. It&#8217;s a dangerous precedent for 2 out of those 4 to not have access to the open web. Web services are only part of the story; HTML and the hyperlink are also both fundamental components of web access. A platform is too shut off from the rest of the world without them.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;m catching up on some news, two posts today about Twitter caught me eye. First, very big news via Federico Viticci, that full tweet search <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/full-archive-search-api">is available even to third-party apps</a>. Twitter&#8217;s limited search was the main reason I originally built <a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">Tweet Library</a>. It&#8217;s fantastic that this data is now more easily available.</p>
<p>But it was this opening paragraph from <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2970341/web-social/twitter-on-the-mac-do-your-job-or-get-out-of-the-way.html">Jason Snell&#8217;s article on Macworld</a> about Twitter neglecting the Mac version that got me thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Three years ago this month Twitter <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1168183/twitter_hands_down_new_strict_rules_for_third_party_developers.html">broke its covenant with the third-party developers</a> who helped fuel its initial growth and create some of its most innovative features. The message was clear: Twitter was in charge of its own platform, and while other Twitter apps would be tolerated, it would only be in limited fashion and for a limited time.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was around this time, nearly 3 years ago, that I posted my last tweet. My bet with <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel</a> is over whether I will return to Twitter within 5 years. People ask if I&#8217;ll come back sooner, and if I did, what it would take. I&#8217;ve often struggled to articulate those conditions, because I think we are seeing <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/ev-on-twitter-third-party-devs.html">slow but consistent progress</a> to unwind the developer-hostile decisions made a few years ago. It may be that in a couple years the environment will be much improved, but there won&#8217;t be any single decision that &#8220;fixed&#8221; it, or it may be that Twitter is doomed to have changing leadership and there will never be any guarantees.</p>
<p>There is one thing, though. There is one change that was made while rolling out the version 1.1 Twitter API: they removed support for unauthenticated RSS feeds of user tweets or timelines. If they reversed that one decision, the next day I would be back on Twitter.</p>
<p>I can pick out a single feature like this, among every other improvement that third-party developers would love to see, because the combination of removing RSS and at the same time locking down the API — those changes together best represent the move away from the open web. Any other incremental improvement short of unauthenticated RSS, no matter how welcome, isn&#8217;t enough.</p>
