				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2016/11/09/on_leaving_twitter">Brent Simmons has left Twitter</a>, frustrated with the diminishing value of the service, Twitter&#8217;s inability to deal with harassment, and more:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  And then it was part of the system that helped elect a fascist President. This tipped it over for me: it’s no longer worth my participation. The shitheads can have it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Facebook has also been in the news for <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/11/09/facebook-kill-news-feed-trump/">its role in letting fake news spread</a>. Ben Thompson has <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/fake-news/">a long essay this week on it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I get why top-down solutions are tempting: fake news and filter bubbles are in front of our face, and wouldn’t it be better if Facebook fixed them? The problem is the assumption that whoever wields that top-down power will just so happen to have the same views I do. What, though, if they don’t?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe. Though while we should debate how to balance Facebook&#8217;s enormous power, there should be a parallel effort to move away from the centralized publishing model that gave Facebook that power.</p>
<p>Facebook has confused itself into thinking it is the whole internet, and so the principles of a free press that apply to the open web, also must apply to Facebook. No. While Facebook has a great responsibility to do the right thing, because they are so big, Facebook is just a web site.</p>
<p>I want Facebook to improve. I want Twitter to improve. But I can do very little to effect change at those companies, and some problems are so fundamental as to be essentially unfixable. The web wasn&#8217;t supposed to be like this, with all the power and all the writing concentrated into so few sites.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for a new social network that brings discoverability and community without the baggage of an ad-driven network that must grow to a billion users. A social network that embraces the open web, and freedom of expression, while preserving a clean timeline that can&#8217;t be interrupted by harassment.</p>
<p>Not just one new social network. I hope that many developers will work on products that encourage independent publishing again.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to take time to build. That&#8217;s why I started working on <a href="http://snippets.today/">Snippets.today</a> 2 years ago. I&#8217;ve made great progress, but I&#8217;ve also drifted, unfocused, uncommitted to finishing it, as if I knew something was missing.</p>
<p>Something <em>was</em> missing. The election results have made that clear. I was thinking big, but not big enough. The way forward must include both a decentralized publishing platform and the tools to encourage a safe community.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to know when the beta is finally ready, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">subscribe to the announce list</a>. Thank you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">written about IPFS</a> before, but <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid</a> (from Tim Berners-Lee himself, among other MIT folks) is another new proposal for a more distributed web. I wasn’t familiar with it until reading <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/ways-to-decentralize-the-web/">this article at Digital Trends</a>, which first makes the case for independent content vs. the big centralized platforms:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now a handful of companies own vast swaths of web activity – Facebook for social networking, Google for searching, eBay for auctions – and quite literally own the data their users have provided and generated. This gives these companies unprecedented power over us, and gives them such a competitive advantage that it’s pretty silly to think you’re going to start up a business that’s going to beat them at their own game.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The article continues with the types of data you might share in a Solid application:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  For example, you might keep your personal information in one or several pods: the sort of data about yourself that you put into your Facebook profile; a list of your friends, family, and colleagues; your banking information; maps of where you’ve traveled; some health information. That way if someone built a new social networking application—perhaps to compete head-on with Facebook, or, more likely, to offer specialized services to people with shared interests—you could join by giving it permission to access the appropriate information in your pod.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the showcase applications is called Client-Integrated Micro-Blogging Architecture, surely named mostly for its pronounceable acronym. From the <a href="https://github.com/linkeddata/cimba">CIMBA project site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  CIMBA is a privacy-friendly, decentralized microblogging application that runs in your browser. It is built using the latest HTML5 technologies and Web standards. With CIMBA, people get a microblogging app that behaves like Twitter, built entirely out of parts they can control.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Solid and CIMBA are built on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a>, which in turn is based off of RDF. I’m admittedly biased against RDF, because it often brings with it an immediate sense of over-engineering — too abstracted, solving too many problems at once. I’m glad to see this activity around a distributed web, and I’ll be following Solid, but I also continue to believe that the simple microformats and APIs from the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWebCamp</a> are the best place to start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dave Winer wants <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/07/22/1400.html">an open alternative to Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I want it to be friendly to Twitter, because as a user and a shareholder, and a developer who uses their platform, I want to see it thrive. But I also strongly believe we need the open system, the <a href="http://scripting.com/2016/06/18/1324.html">Central Park</a> to Twitter&#8217;s condo buildings on Fifth Ave and Central Park West.
</p></blockquote>
<p>John Biesnecker, reading Dave&#8217;s post, <a href="https://gist.github.com/biesnecker/d585c1ba395ffa5c8148128372aa8e2e">suggested XMPP</a> because it&#8217;s an open standard and federated. But as great as XMPP is for messaging, it seems too different from the web; it would be like starting over. The nice thing about building on independent microblogs is that we can leverage the existing open web infrastructure: all the WordPress installs, RSS feeds, and new work from the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWebCamp</a>.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve tried to do for <a href="http://snippets.today/">Snippets.today</a>. Learn from the UI innovations of Twitter — the fast timeline experience, the effortless posting — but without skipping the important first step of independent web publishing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://ma.tt/2016/07/mortgaging-your-sites-future/">Matt Mullenweg comments</a> on whether choosing Medium is a good long-term bet:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In making the decision to hitch their horse to Medium’s wagon while fording a river, they’re probably betting on Medium not going out of business, which I agree there’s only like a 10% chance of happening. However I think there is a 97% chance that Medium’s business model will change in the future because the path they’re on and these publishers are dependent on will not sustain their current costs or the investment they’ve raised.
</p></blockquote>
<p>10% chance of going out of business compares poorly to Matt&#8217;s Automattic itself, which <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/complete-mirror-of-this-blog.html">as I&#8217;ve written about before</a> is one of only a couple web publishing companies that I think could last 100 years. If your goal is to write something that many people can read for years to come, why risk it on an uncertain platform?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a longer <a href="https://videopress.com/embed/MVF9BxaG">video interview with Matt from WordCamp Europe</a> last month, where he goes into more detail on the role of Medium and WordPress. Highly recommended if you&#8217;re interested in the open web, or just curious how progress is made in the WordPress community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve owned an Amazon Echo <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/amazon-echo.html">since it first shipped</a> and it’s great. I also use Siri and like it, though I use it less often for the kind of random questions I might ask Alexa. But after watching yesterday’s Google I/O keynote, I can’t help but feel that eventually Google is going to be far ahead of Amazon and Apple in this space.</p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/05/18/google-io-2016">Here’s John Gruber</a> writing at Daring Fireball about the keynote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Google is clearly the best at this voice-driven assistant stuff. Pichai claimed that in their own competitive analysis, Google Assistant is “an order of magnitude” ahead of competing assistants (read: Siri and Alexa). That sounds about right.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with a voice assistant is that the better it gets, the more you want it to do. You continue to ask it more complicated questions, pushing at the limits of the assistant’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Only Google has the expertise in web services and the massive amount of data to keep going beyond basic questions. I expect both Siri and Alexa will hit brick walls that Google will get past, especially in conversational queries that let the user drill down below the most popular, superficial facts.</p>
<p>That is, unless Apple can open up Siri. Not just plugging in new trigger keywords like Alexa’s “skills” API (which would be a good start), but maybe a complete way to extend Siri with third-party code that feels seamless to the user. Surfacing voice-enabled apps automatically through natural queries might be on the same scale of app discoverability as we saw when the App Store launched.</p>
<p>As Ben Thompson lays out well <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/googles-go-to-market-gap/">in today’s essay</a>, Google faces a different internet than the open web on which they built their search engine. The default for all these new platforms — from Facebook to Siri to the App Store — is to be closed. There’s a narrow window, right now, for someone to take the lead on creating an open voice assistant standard built on the open web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/05/mediums-latest-intriguing-publishing-experiment/">Glenn Fleishman writes for Six Colors</a> about Medium&#8217;s subscription features that will let publishers charge readers:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It’s absolutely clear the revenue side is an experiment, and Medium labels it as such all over. There’s no guarantee it will work for its early partners or pan out in the long run. But it’s the only publishing option that combines so many things in one place without any over-the-top cost or commitment on the part of a periodical.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While Medium is certainly doing a lot right, and I still think <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/silos-as-shortcuts.html">it&#8217;s not a bad place to mirror content</a>, the &#8220;long run&#8221; Glenn mentions is really what we should think about when considering Medium. I have no confidence that Medium will last 5-10 years.</p>
<p>If my whole business was based on blogging, why would I trust Medium to control something so crucial? With iOS development, we have no choice but to use the App Store. Writing on the web isn&#8217;t like that, and voluntarily giving up both control of the publishing platform and 20% of revenue strikes me as very short-sighted.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When my family was visiting New York City a couple of years ago, we took a train out of Pennsylvania Station on the way up to Montreal for the second half of our vacation. It was raining a little as we walked from the hotel, but I thought we&#8217;d still have no trouble finding the station. After a few minutes we gave up and had to ask someone where the entrance was.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t find it because it looked like every other street corner in Manhattan. But it wasn&#8217;t always like that. It used to look like this:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2016/penn_station.jpg" width="448" height="350" alt="Pennsylvania Station in the 1910s" /></center></p>
<p>In the 1960s, facing declining train usage and financial problems, the Pennsylvania Railroad sold the rights to everything above ground and the incredible station pictured above was demolished. It was only afterwards, when it actually happened, that everyone fully realized what they had lost. Determined to not let other beautiful architectural landmarks get destroyed, the city passed a law to restrict similar demolition. Grand Central Terminal was preserved because of the lesson learned from letting Pennsylvania Station go.</p>
<p>I was thinking about this story — failing to do the right thing, but applying that knowledge to the <em>next</em> thing — while re-reading <a href="https://marco.org/2016/05/07/apple-role-in-podcasting">Marco&#8217;s excellent post on the future of podcasting</a>. In it, he lays out the technical details for how podcasting works today, and makes the case for leaving it alone. I especially like this part, on his determination to keep Overcast a sort of pure MP3 client:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  By the way, while I often get pitched on garbage podcast-listening-behavioral-data integrations, <strong>I’m never adding such tracking to Overcast.</strong> Never. The biggest reason I made a free, mass-market podcast app was so I could take stands like this.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I should have realized it earlier, but I don&#8217;t think I really connected all of Marco&#8217;s goals with Overcast until Daniel Jalkut and I had him on <a href="http://coreint.org/200">Core Intuition episode 200</a>. We talked about many of these same themes as Marco was finishing up Overcast 2.0.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a great discussion <a href="https://www.relay.fm/upgrade/88">on Upgrade</a> about this. It starts <a href="https://overcast.fm/+DeCngCgj8/43:07">about halfway through</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-podcasting-divergence/">In a response to Marco on MacStories</a>, Federico Viticci writes about the parallel trend in the web industry toward centralized services like Facebook and Medium that allow &#8220;content professionals&#8221; to monetize their writing. In doing so, those writers give up many of the benefits of the open web:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  But the great thing about the free and decentralized web is that the aforementioned web platforms are optional and they&#8217;re alternatives to an existing open field where independent makers can do whatever they want. I can own my content, offer my RSS feed to anyone, and resist the temptation of slowing down my website with 10 different JavaScript plugins to monitor what my users do. No one is forcing me to agree to the terms of a platform.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While the open web still exists, we really dropped the ball protecting and strengthening it. Fewer people&#8217;s first choice for publishing is to start a web site hosted at their own domain. Like the destruction of Pennsylvania Station, sometimes you only know in hindsight that you&#8217;ve made a mistake. We were so caught up in Twitter and Facebook that we let the open web crumble. I&#8217;m not giving up — I think we can get people excited about blogging and owning their own content again — but it would have been easier if we had realized <a href="http://anildash.com/2012/12/the-web-we-lost.html">what we lost</a> earlier.</p>
<p>Reading posts like Marco&#8217;s and Federico&#8217;s, and listening to Jason and Myke on Upgrade, I&#8217;m convinced that podcasting will remain open because <em>we know better now</em>. As a community we can learn from the mistakes with the web and the threats of closed platforms, making sure that podcasting is preserved as a simple technology that no one controls.</p>

  “Facebook is using open web technology to power Instant Articles. I&#8217;m not sharing anything that isn&#8217;t already publicly documented on the Facebook developer site. People have trouble understanding this, I assume, because it seems so out of character for a big web destination like Facebook to care about the open web. It&#8217;s kind of a miracle. But there it is. The open web is about to get a real shot in the arm from a most unexpected place.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess one question is whether there will be any other RSS readers that support Instant Articles. If we can get some of the benefits of Instant Articles, but outside of Facebook, that is something.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/manton/status/254228056657494016">Three years ago today</a> I posted my last personal tweet. That time and distance away from mainstream social networking has given me a new perspective on the importance of independent microblogging. It has shaped <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">where I write</a> and what tools I build.</p>
<p>But Twitter remains as fascinating as ever. Just a few weeks ago, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/11891887/adam-bain-interview-twitter-jack-dorsey.html">the board seemed unsure</a> about letting Jack Dorsey split his time between Twitter and Square:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The responsibilities of running Square, which Dorsey reportedly refuses to give up, may now stand in the way of a Steve <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/steve-jobs/">Jobs-esque</a> return as Twitter’s full time chief executive. In June, its board took the unusual step of publicly declaring that it would only consider candidates &#8216;who are in a position to make a full-time commitment to Twitter&#8217;, a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/11691834/Jack-Dorsey-will-have-to-quit-as-Square-boss-to-take-charge-of-Twitter.html">thinly-veiled reference to Dorsey’s preoccupations</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Then they <a href="http://recode.net/2015/09/30/sources-jack-dorsey-to-be-named-permanent-twitter-ceo/">backed away from that</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;That declaration, as it seems to have turned out, has been a largely empty one. The idea that Dorsey might return gained steam among people both inside and outside the company over the past few months even though he had no intention of leaving Square. He even referred to the companies as his two children when discussing the dilemma, according to a source.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Today they officially announced that Jack will return to lead Twitter. Of all the recent articles, my favorite <a href="http://recode.net/2015/10/02/why-jack-dorsey-is-ready-to-save-twitter/">is this one from Recode</a>, a long profile on Jack&#8217;s role and changing attitude:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;He seems to be a completely different man than the one who returned to Twitter in March 2011 as executive chairman and product czar. Former colleagues recall a man looking for payback for his 2008 ouster; loyalty was key, and many who were loyal to Twitter’s other co-founder, Ev Williams, were booted from the company. Back then, Dorsey would routinely sit in on meetings without saying a word. When he did speak, his contributions were so abstract that few understood what he was talking about. In some cases, he’d simply write a single word or two up on the whiteboard.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>And it goes on, showing how Jack has matured as a leader. Everyone will be watching what he does, and how Twitter evolves. Every article written about an upcoming Twitter feature will mention Jack&#8217;s involvement, no matter how insignificant. He&#8217;s a big part of the story now.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@ev/why-i-m-glad-jack-is-back-at-twitter-9bbda2ae5dca">Ev also wrote</a> about the official announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Twitter is bigger and more important to the world than we ever dreamed when we started. And it still has incredible, unrealized potential. It will not be easy to unlock it. But we have thousands of smart, creative people working every day to make the company great. And Jack has already demonstrated the ability to inspire the team and think boldly about the next phase of Twitter.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The greatest challenge for Jack will be figuring out how to take whatever those thousands of employees are working on and turn it into actual user-facing features that ship to customers. Federico Viticci, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot/">reviewing the new Tweetbot 4 release</a> last week, wrote about how Tapbots has built something more ambitious than the official Twitter for iPad app, even though Twitter has a much bigger team:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;On the other hand, Twitter for iPad – long ignored by the company – has emerged again <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/twitter-aims-to-unify-ios-apps-updates-its-ipad-app/">with a stretched-up iPhone layout</a> presented in the name of &#8216;consistency&#8217;. It&#8217;s a grim landscape, devoid of the excitement and curiosity that surrounded Twitter clients five years ago.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I still run <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker</a>, which was created during that period of innovation that Federico refers to, but my focus now is on indie microblogging and the open web. I&#8217;m content to watch Twitter from the sidelines and wish Jack the best of luck.</p>
