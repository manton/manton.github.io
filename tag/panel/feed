				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There will be many C4 wrap-up blog posts, but &#8220;Fraser Speirs hit the spirit of the conference&#8221;:http://speirs.org/2008/09/08/c42-brain-dump/ very well:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I thought C4 was incredibly reflective. If you imagine it as a smaller WWDC, it&#8217;s really nothing like that. The amount of code shown on-screen is really quite small, and the conversation is really about the art, craft, business, science and lifestyle of Mac development.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I had a great time at C4. As always I met a bunch of new folks and caught up with everyone I hadn&#8217;t seen since WWDC or the previous C4. It was especially wonderful to hear the positive feedback about &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ in person. Thanks!</p>
<p>I also participated from the stage, as Wolf called me up to be on Saturday night&#8217;s panel literally minutes before it started. I have a feeling I came off as a bit of an oddball &mdash; I managed to shrug off software pirates, decry moving away from Subversion, suggest a &#8220;crap&#8221; label for the App Store, and actually recommend Dreamhost &mdash; but I hope there was value in it for attendees, even if it was less exciting than last year&#8217;s panel. Wil Shipley did a great job guiding questions for the panel.</p>
