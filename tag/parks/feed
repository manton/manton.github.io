				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">trying to work from a new coffee shop</a> I had never been to before, every day for 30 days, I loved the routine of getting out of the house so much that I set on another challenge: visiting 30 libraries. This proved to be more difficult, mostly because of the extra driving required, but I wrapped it up yesterday.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve put together <a href="http://www.manton.org/libraries-austin">a web page of all the libraries</a>, with photos and links to the microblog posts for each day. The posts are also tagged with <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/newlibraries">#newlibraries</a>.</p>
<p>After wrapping up libraries, I thought I&#8217;d make it a trilogy of 30-day endeavors, with a final 30 days of working from city parks. This was a suggestion from <a href="https://twitter.com/dcoder">Daniel Hedrick</a>, who had worked from parks before, tethering to his iPhone since there&#8217;s usually no wi-fi. I loved the idea right away because it fit so well with the goal of getting out of the house and discovering something new in my own city. I even spent a couple hours earlier in the month researching parks and planning out whether I could do it.</p>
<p>But now that it has come to it&#8230; I am really burned out on commuting. Finding new coffee shops and libraries has been a great experience. There are several wonderful places that I know I will return to again, and I never would have found them otherwise. I just need a little break from the forced routine of driving somewhere new each day. Maybe I&#8217;ll pick up the parks idea next year.</p>
