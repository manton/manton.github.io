				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I subscribe to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/04/17_services_for.html">a lot of web applications</a> for my indie business, from hosting to invoicing and reporting services. But I also pay for web <em>content</em> when it&#8217;s compelling enough. Here are some web sites with writing and art that I think are worth supporting directly:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"><strong>New York Times.</strong></a> Still the best reporting on the 2016 presidential campaign. While I usually use RSS for news and blogs, I check the New York Times manually each morning to see what is happening in the world. <em>$10/month.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://insider.espn.com/"><strong>ESPN Insider.</strong></a> Extra articles to supplement what I read during NBA season. Seemed easy to justify as an expense for my podcast <a href="http://technicalfoul.fm/">Technical Foul</a> with Ben Thompson. Also comes with the ESPN print magazine. <em>$39/year.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://club.macstories.net/"><strong>Club MacStories.</strong></a> I&#8217;ve enjoyed reading MacStories for years, and the club subscription adds a bunch of great content in a weekly newsletter. You also get occasional book downloads such as for Federico Viticci&#8217;s new <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-10-the-macstories-review/">epic iOS 10 review</a>. <em>$5/month.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/"><strong>Six Colors.</strong></a> Jason Snell wasted no time after leaving Macworld. Seemingly overnight, Six Colors has become an important site for Apple fans. Jason and Dan Moren talk informally about current work, travel, writing, and tools on their secret podcast for subscribers. There&#8217;s also a monthly email magazine. <em>$6/month.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/membership/"><strong>Stratechery.</strong></a> Thoughtful analysis of current news and trends from Ben Thompson, delivered Monday through Thursday via email or RSS for subscribers. Great depth to stories about tech company business models and where the industry is going. Helps pay for his NBA League Pass subscription. <em>$10/month.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://itsoncraft.com/"><strong>Craft.</strong></a> An archive of sketches, rough animation, and preproduction artwork from animated films. It&#8217;s like an expanded version of behind-the-scenes DVD extras and art books. Initially subscribed for the rough animation for the beautiful film Song of the Sea. <em>$6/month.</em></p>
<p>Before the web dominated all publishing, it was normal to pay for the newspaper and maybe a few print magazines. Then we entered a period where everything had to be free. Now, paying for content is useful again. The sites above have figured something out about building an audience and creating good content.</p>
