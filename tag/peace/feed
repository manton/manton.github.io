				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard that Marco Arment has pulled his content-blocking app Peace from the App Store. The app was <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/09/18/just-doesnt-feel-good">extremely successful</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;As I write this, Peace has been the number one paid app in the U.S. App Store for about 36 hours. It’s a massive achievement that should be the highlight of my professional career. If <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> even broke the top 100, I’d be over the moon.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen some comments asking why he didn&#8217;t think to do this sooner, before he even shipped the app. But we are just now starting to understand the impact of ad blockers in iOS 9. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an exaggeration to say that the web is different than it was a few days ago, and so our choices — and Marco&#8217;s — are different too. As I mentioned <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/wrap-up-thoughts-on-the-tv-web.html">yesterday</a>, content blockers are one facet of an overall shake-up for the web.</p>
<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2015/09/18/why_we_love_indies">Brent Simmons writes</a> that only indies can do what Marco did. Marco must have left a lot of money on the table with this decision. It will always look like the right call to me when someone goes with their gut feeling and not with profit.</p>
