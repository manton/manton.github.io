				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have heard by now that <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/04/16/silverpine-software/">Photos+ has a new home at SilverPine software</a>. My friend Jonathan Hays — now co-founder of SilverPine — is of course also half of <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a>, so it was a great fit for him to take on another photo app as well. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “In addition to consulting, we intend to slowly grow a portfolio of software. To that end, we are announcing today that we have purchased Photos+ from Second Gear Software. We have quite a bit of expertise with photo Apps (see Sunlit, among others) and when Justin Williams approached me about purchasing it from him, it felt like a great fit. We have big plans for Photos+ and have already put into motion the first phase of those plans: native Dropbox integration!”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I tested the Dropbox support during the 1.1 beta and think it’s a great direction to take the app. Dropbox the company is going all in on photos: just in the last week shipping Carousel and now acquiring Loom. The more people start using Dropbox to store all their photos, the more useful companion photo apps like Photos+ and Sunlit will be.</p>
<p>And now <a href="http://carpeaqua.com/2014/04/17/moonshots/">Justin Williams is free to focus all his time on Glassboard</a>. While I’ve been building web services and subscription apps for a while now, the truth is I’m still figuring out how to do this as a business too. I’ve learned a lot from Justin’s recent blog posts on the subject.</p>
