				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maciej Cegłowski of Pinboard has always been open about his stats for the service. Now, on the 7th anniversary, <a href="https://blog.pinboard.in/2016/07/pinboard_turns_seven/">he also shares that revenue has grown to well over $200k/year</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’ve added revenue this year because I&#8217;m no longer afraid of competitors, and I&#8217;d like to encourage people who are considering doing their own one- or zero-person business. The site costs something like $17K/year to run, so you can make a good living at this artisanal SaaS stuff.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Congrats to Maciej on his success. I&#8217;ve been a happy Pinboard user for pretty much all of those 7 years, and — as someone who also aspires to build a profitable web platform — I&#8217;m inspired by Pinboard’s consistency and growth.</p>
<p>Speaking of 6-figure income, I’ve also just finished reading Shawn Blanc’s write-up <a href="https://thefocuscourse.com/behind-the-scenes-six-figure-course-launch/">about launching The Focus Course</a>, which had first-week revenue of over $100k. He describes the planning process and his strategy for using a mailing list to build awareness about the product.</p>
