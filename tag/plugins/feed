				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned in my &#8220;Rails rant last week&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2009/01/rails_4_years_later.html, I have an unhealthy distrust for Rails plug-ins and monkey-patching gems. In addition to often breaking when you upgrade Rails, too many high-level abstractions can make it difficult to understand and debug the code later when things go wrong. For those reasons I will sometimes roll my own solution instead of using someone else&#8217;s. (As an aside, I rarely do this with Mac development, perhaps because I understand the internals of Mac frameworks much better than I do for the Rails core.)</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve just been so impressed with the &#8220;will_paginate&#8221;:http://wiki.github.com/mislav/will_paginate plug-in. It&#8217;s fast and there are no obvious compromises &mdash; good out-of-the-box defaults and enough hooks that it can be customized.</p>
<p>If you are doing any Ruby on Rails work and haven&#8217;t checked it out yet, I think you&#8217;ll find that will_paginate is a very elegant solution to something every web app is going to need.</p>
