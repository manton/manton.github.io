				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I published 2 new <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable</a> episodes this week, with a shared theme around Kickstarter projects. They&#8217;re both just 5-6 minutes long.</p>
<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/04/episode-19-kickstarter-recording/">Episode 19</a> is about how I finally sat down to record a video for my upcoming Kickstarter project. I still have editing to do, but I&#8217;m already feeling a lot better about actually launching this.</p>
<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/04/episode-20-kickstarter-rewards/">Episode 20</a> continues the discussion of Kickstarter, starting with my reaction after receiving the art book from <a href="http://blog.loish.net/">Loish</a> yesterday. I was really impressed with how well it was produced. Anytime I see something of such high quality I&#8217;m inspired to do a better job with my own work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m registered for the <a href="https://releasenotes.tv/conference/">Release Notes conference</a>, coming up later this year in Indianapolis. This will be the only conference I attend this year outside of another ticketless WWDC week. If you didn&#8217;t go last year and want to know more about it, check out the web site or <a href="https://releasenotes.tv/151-our-2-0-1/">listen to episode 151 of their podcast</a>.</p>
<p>One of my favorite blog posts on this site from last year was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/10/release-notes-2015.html">my review of the conference</a>, because I think it both described the conference itself and also captured that inspired feeling you get when you&#8217;re heading off to the airport and your head is buzzing with ideas. And because it&#8217;s a blog, where I allow myself to be informal, it also has the meandering narrative of the everyday — a stop for coffee, a conversation with an Uber driver. My memory of the conference wouldn&#8217;t be complete without those things.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to visiting Indianapolis again. I may also look at flying into Chicago and taking the train down, then flying out. Sounds like some people did that last year, and I think it would make a great start considering the venue at Union Station. We&#8217;ll see if the schedule works out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/03/episode-225-keep-your-eyes-open/">Episode 225 of Core Intuition</a> is out now. We talk about the new iPhone and iPad news from Monday’s Apple event, plus Swift. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Manton orders his dream phone, the iPhone SE. Daniel reflects on the growing allure of Swift, and the two discuss the risks of either adopting new technologies too soon, or holding on to the past for too long.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Also there&#8217;s this line from Daniel in the podcast that I like:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We have to be tuned into the future <em>and</em> tuned into the past to really do great work.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We pull in some history from Daniel&#8217;s time at Apple, and from our experience building Mac apps in the 1990s and early 2000s, and how it relates to the current Swift transition. Hope you enjoy it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the latest <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/16">Under the Radar podcast</a>, Marco Arment and David Smith talk about ways to make your app more robust. That includes tips for scaling your app with a lot of data, and also dealing with potentially hostile user data. It’s that last point that I’ve been thinking the most about lately.</p>
<p>With the experience of building Tumblr and Instapaper, Marco is clearly now hesitant to ship app features that accept arbitrary user-generated content, because a small indie company just doesn’t have the resources to deal with spam and abuse. Instead, he suggests outsourcing whenever possible. For example, letting Apple accept and reject podcasts, and basing the Overcast podcast directory search on that already-vetted list.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re building a Twitter-like service. As we all know, hate is widespread on Twitter. At times, it seems impossible to even have a G-rated Twitter experience. But the problem is less that users can publish terrible tweets, and more that it is so easy to be <em>exposed to those tweets</em> with search, trending topics, retweets, and replies.</p>
<p>As I work on my microblogging project, I’m trying to be aware of these points in the platform where bad content can leak out. So I don’t have global search or trending topics. I also don’t make it easy to stumble upon random users. But I do have replies, which by default will currently go out as push notifications if you have the iPhone app installed. It’s that area that I should focus my attention.</p>
<p>Two options that come to mind for minimizing abuse in replies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t allow replies from people you aren’t following. This solves the problem, but it comes at the expense of discussion. It removes the accessibility that many people love about Twitter’s asynchronous following model.</li>
<li>Quarantine or attempt to classify replies so they don’t bubble up in your timeline or as notifications by default. This would be like an over-aggressive email spam filter. Difficult to get right and possibly routed around by clever microbloggers.</li>
</ul>
<p>After listening to Marco and David, and reviewing the full scope of what I’ve been trying to build, I’m pretty concerned about this. I’m looking at <a href="https://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, and other metrics internal to my app for judging content and suspicious user accounts, but I may be a little in over my head on this issue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Charles Perry has started a microblog. On the balance of what he should post to Twitter and what he should post to his own site first, <a href="http://dazeend.org/2016/02/dazeend-org-microblog/">he writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Most of the things I write on Twitter are snippets of conversations or other thoughts that I don’t necessarily want to preserve. Those will stay on Twitter. But some microposts—is that a thing?—I think are of interest on their own. These I plan to post to the DazeEnd.org microblog and mirror to Twitter. That should allow me to preserve and archive my thoughts on my own website and use Twitter just for distribution.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I was really happy to see these posts show up in my RSS reader. There&#8217;s some momentum around indie microblogging right now. You should start one too.</p>
<p>Here are some more of my posts on the topic:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/04/how-to-start-a-microblog.html">How to start a microblog</a>. Overview of the basics, with a few suggestions for where to start.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">Microblogging with WordPress</a>. Still mostly accurate, although I don&#8217;t use IFTTT anymore. I&#8217;ve written my own cross-posting code and baked it into my new app.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/embrace-cross-posting.html">Embrace cross-posting</a>. My early thoughts on cross-posting. Also see <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/fine-heres-a-twitter-feed.html">the post about returning to Twitter</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">RSS for microblogs</a>. Suggestions for simplifying our RSS feeds, and a proposal for JSON.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.manton.org/category/weblogs/">Weblogs category from my blog</a>. All the posts primarily about weblogs or microblogging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Listeners of my new Timetable podcast also know that I&#8217;m writing a short book about independent microblogging. You can hear a little about this <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/01/episode-9-not-just-an-app/">on episode 9</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I started a new short-form podcast called <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable</a>. Each episode is 3-5 minutes. It has been really fun to record the show because I can try new things without investing too much time.</p>
<p>One goal from the very beginning was to record from iOS so that I could easily record outside the house. I wanted not just the flexibility to be away from my computer, but a stereo microphone that could capture some of the surrounding environment, to give it a more informal feel. (I’m actually cheating in some cases and using multiple tracks, to make editing easier, but I think the effect works. All the episodes have been exported to mono so far, though.)</p>
<p>I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072DKYFO">this cheap iPhone microphone</a> for testing — only $10 when I ordered it! — and figured after some experiments with my iPhone 4S, I would invest in something new. I liked it enough that I’m still using the mic with my 5S via a Lightning cable adapter. I’m also using a foam pop filter that I already had from a previous old mic.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2016/microphone_with_filter.jpg" width="550" height="244" alt="Microphone" border="0" /></center></p>
<p>This may be the single best value in a tech gadget I’ve ever purchased. Total cost for producing the podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072DKYFO">Microphone</a>: $10</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8">Ferrite</a>: $20</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8">Workflow</a>: $3 (for MP3 conversion)</li>
<li>Domain name: $120 (.fm domains are expensive)</li>
</ul>
<p>I certainly didn’t invent the idea of a “microcast”. There are other good short podcasts, such as <a href="http://bitesize.tech/">Bite Size Tech</a>. But I’m happy to see even more people trying out the idea. <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/">Michael</a> even started a new podcast called <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/microcast/">Driftwood</a> to chronicle the development of <a href="https://github.com/LK64076007A/driftwood">his Jekyll template</a> for microcasts.</p>
<p>Ferrite also continues to impress. It’s a very high quality iOS app and is competitive with Mac multi-track audio editors. For a good introduction, check out <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/">Jason Snell’s review</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just published <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/01/episode-5-mailing-stickers/">episode 5</a> of my new short-format podcast, Timetable. I&#8217;m having a <em>lot</em> of fun with this. Producing an episode that&#8217;s only 5 minutes long means I can experiment without investing too much time.</p>
<p>As I was listening to some other podcasts this week talk about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/twitters-10k-limit.html">the Twitter news</a>, it occurred to me how important it is to have a good mix of podcasts, just as it is with blogging. Many of the most popular Apple-related podcasts hit the same news stories each week and have nearly the same opinion. Don&#8217;t get me wrong; I listen to a bunch of them and they&#8217;re great. But it&#8217;s a reminder to me that for Timetable, and especially for <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, not to be afraid of having a more contrarian role when it&#8217;s appropriate.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing controversial in the latest episode of <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/">Timetable</a>, though. Just me talking about getting some stamps to finally send out <a href="https://twitter.com/riverfold/status/651509114284044288">stickers</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://coreint.org/211">Today on Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I talk about my time at the tvOS Tech Talk and the recent executive changes at Apple. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Manton and Daniel discuss Apple TV development challenges, Apple’s executive team shakeup and its impact on the App Stores, and keeping a good attitude about successes and shortcomings as an ambitious indie developer.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>We wrap up the show with a conversation about taking risks and setting the right priorities for an indie business. Along the way I mention <a href="http://twitter.com/boltcity/status/6672228351">this tweet from Kazu Kibuishi</a>, which I misquoted slightly. Here&#8217;s the actual text:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;A professor once told me that &#8216;if you have a fallback, you will fall back.&#8217; I have found this to be true.&#8221;
