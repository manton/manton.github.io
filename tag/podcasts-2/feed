				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Daniel and I covered a few topics on <a href="http://coreint.org/259">Core Intuition 259</a> yesterday, but the closing segment about the Apple design book — and indirectly, the election — was particularly interesting to me. I decided to transcribe part of the conversation. Here it is, lightly edited.</em></p>
<p><strong>Daniel:</strong></p>
<p>Alright Manton, I know what a fan you are of lavish Apple products designed for the rich. [laughter] I know therefore you have probably already placed a pre-order for the Apple Book Edition.</p>
<p><strong>Manton:</strong></p>
<p>Is the Edition the $300 one?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel:</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, the $300 one is the Edition. The $200 one is the Edition Lite. [more laughter]</p>
<p><strong>Manton:</strong></p>
<p>So Apple announced this book yesterday, and I believe orders are being accepted today. It&#8217;s just this very beautiful, well-produced &#8220;we worked 8 years on this&#8221; book of essentially product photos.</p>
<p>And I think there&#8217;s an introduction with Jony Ive. There&#8217;s a video from him that is a classic Jony Ive video about a product.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve blogged about this a little bit, and actually talked about this on my microcast, <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/11/episode-27-something-was-missing/">Timetable</a>. Red flags are going off for me with this product for a few reasons.</p>
<p>The first is, we&#8217;re a week out from the election. A lot of us are bummed out and trying to make sense of the world, and Apple releases a book of product photos. It seems out of touch. I don&#8217;t understand why they did this right now.</p>
<p>And the other thing, I just hit on something that bothered me about this book. I have a lot of books in this house. Bookshelves and bookshelves full of books. My wife hates the fact that I have every book that I&#8217;ve ever bought. I have a lot of books and I have a lot of art books. In a previous life I wanted to an artist, an animator. I have a lot of art books.</p>
<p>And so this is right up my alley, right? I love old stuff. I love art books. Why don&#8217;t I want to buy this?</p>
<p>And I think the reason is, unlike most art books, which are about&#8230; They&#8217;re about the artist as much as the art. And this book is just photos of iMacs.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t about the designers. And maybe there&#8217;s something in the book that I&#8217;m missing. That when I hold it I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Oh, this book is amazing.&#8221; But I feel like this book is not quite right. It&#8217;s not about the designers.</p>
<p>I want to know about the designers at Apple, and why they made their choices. I don&#8217;t need this well-lit photo of the inside of a Mac Mini. There&#8217;s something missing with what they&#8217;ve done here.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel:</strong></p>
<p>You know, I agree with you. What you said just now is interesting to me in a few different ways. One of them is — and I know people are going to think I&#8217;m crazy for even imagining that this could possibly happen in the wake of a U.S. presidential election — but one of my instincts the day after the election, believe it or not, was actually going to Apple.com to see if Apple had some kind of commemoration or acknowledgement.</p>
<p>And I realized&#8230; That&#8217;s my passionate, emotional side. Because Apple has been that company on so many issues of national or global importance.</p>
<p>And I get it. Even if I see it as a catastrophic thing for the country and for the world, I get it that it is seen as a partisan issue, and that a lot of people would agree it would be not only poor business, but maybe poor taste to take a stand on Apple.com.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s the kind of feeling I&#8217;ve had from this company over the years. I wasn&#8217;t surprised not to see something there, but that sensitivity to the current state of affairs in the world, while maybe not driving them to put something on their home page overtly in support of one direction or another&#8230; I can see how they could maybe have made an effort to come up with something that somehow spoke to the issue without taking a side. They could have done that.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m not faulting them for not doing that. But your comment about the possible poor timing of releasing this right after the election, it drives it home for me that doing something like that with the home page would have reflected a level of consciousness about what&#8217;s going on — their being sympathetic or even empathic to the situation.</p>
<p>Releasing a self-gratifying, expensive art book certainly does not speak to sensitivity about the national and global implications of the election. Nor should it have to. But by doing it the very week of the election, it does sort of tip the sales toward insensitivity.</p>
<p><strong>Manton:</strong></p>
<p>Right. So we had the election. A lot of people are trying to make sense of it. Like you said, you went to Apple. &#8220;Is Apple going to say anything?&#8221; Reload, reload. No, they&#8217;re not going to say anything. &#8220;Is Apple going to say anything next week?&#8221;</p>
<p>The first thing they said, not about the election but the first thing they publicly said was, &#8220;We have this beautiful book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, they didn&#8217;t mean it that way. They didn&#8217;t mean it as a reaction to the election. They&#8217;ve had this thing planned for years. But it doesn&#8217;t feel right.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to take away anything from the designers at Apple and the people that worked on this book, because they do great work. The products in this book <em>are</em> amazing. They do deserve to be celebrated and talked about. But the timing does not feel right.</p>
<p>And like I said before, I think the substance of this book is also wrong. I want to be careful not to criticize too much, because I&#8217;m sensitive to this. I don&#8217;t want to just bash this book. It doesn&#8217;t feel like the book we need about design at Apple. Because there&#8217;s no text in it!</p>
<p>It celebrates objects and machines but it doesn&#8217;t celebrate people. The people are one of the most important things about design at Apple. It doesn&#8217;t seem right.</p>
<p>I had never thought after the election, &#8220;What would Apple say? Would they put something on their web site?&#8221; I hadn&#8217;t thought of that until you just mentioned it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/read-tim-cooks-email-to-apple-employees-after-donald-trumps">Tim Cook did send a letter</a> to Apple employees, an email. It wasn&#8217;t really partisan, but it was kind of saying, &#8220;We know some of y&#8217;all are having trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how he phrased it. But the sense of it was, &#8220;We&#8217;re moving forward together. We&#8217;re going to be together. That&#8217;s how we get through everything as a company.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was private to Apple employees. They didn&#8217;t say anything publicly. To say something publicly would have been difficult. This is kind of a cheat, but I&#8217;m just going to say it: it would have taken courage to say something about the election publicly. I&#8217;m using that word very deliberately.</p>
<p>Come on, Apple. Forget about the stupid headphone jack. If you want to be courageous, take a stand on something you believe in. Do it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I published a <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/11/episode-27-something-was-missing/">new episode of Timetable</a>. It&#8217;s about Apple&#8217;s new design book but also about how social networks are broken, with a hint of what I think we can do about it. It&#8217;s just 3 and a half minutes long.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/10/apple-apologists.html">I&#8217;ve written about before</a>, Apple no longer needs us to defend the company. On the other hand, many good people work on Apple&#8217;s products and so criticizing the company can easily come across as criticizing those people. That&#8217;s not my intention, but I sometimes get that balance wrong.</p>
<p>I own dozens and dozens of art books, but I won&#8217;t be ordering this new Apple design book. It looks overconfident instead of nostalgic. It looks like it celebrates objects instead of people. It looks like a beautiful book for the wrong time.</p>

I was in 2008, I was earlier this year, and absolutely <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/07/this-is-hillarys-week.html">I am now</a>, as Donald Trump seems intent with each daily blunder to prove he&#8217;s the worst candidate the Republicans have fielded in quite some time.</p>
<p>Having said that, even leaving the politics aside, I think the new podcast &#8220;With her&#8221; from the Hillary campaign is fantastic. It&#8217;s exactly what a podcast should be: well-produced, yet informal, with just enough of a look behind the scenes to feel personal.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s 2 weeks before WWDC, which means it was also 8 years ago that we published the <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2008/05/episode-1-two-voices/">first episode</a> of Core Intuition. At WWDC that year, Apple showed off iPhone OS 2.0, MobileMe, and the iPhone 3G. The yearly cycle of improvements to the OS and hardware don’t look much different today, but <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1151235/macs/apple-rolls.html">Apple keeps rolling</a>, and so the total changes since 2008 are massive.</p>
<p>For as many years as I’ve been out to San Francisco for WWDC (and to San Jose before then), each year I have fewer expectations for the conference itself. Some years I don’t even bother guessing or dreaming about new features — I have no pressing needs, no critical missing APIs, no questions to ask Apple engineers in the labs — and I’m happily surprised by whatever Apple gives us.</p>
<p>This year is a little different. It’s the first year that I can remember since the Mac OS X 10.0 and 10.1 releases where an Apple platform needed significant performance improvements to be usable for anyone except early adopters. The first couple versions of Apple Watch were ambitious on features, but now it’s time to do the less glamorous work of making the platform fast. I hope watchOS 3.0 will be the same kind of milestone that Mac OS X 10.2 was in that regard. (And like Mac OS X, I hope it can be done <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/slow-transitions-in-watchos.html">mostly in new software</a>.)</p>
<p>Back to WWDC the conference. I’m still thinking about the interesting venue change for Monday to the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.</p>
<p>In the discussion on <a href="http://coreint.org/229">Core Intuition 229</a> last month, I kept coming back to the idea that this change has to be about growing the conference to allow more developers. Since more people show up on Monday (press and business folks, for example, who have less interest in the technical sessions or labs), you could have a bigger space on Monday and then <em>oversell</em> the conference as a whole, knowing that some ticket holders wouldn’t be around later in the week back at Moscone West.</p>
<p>Maybe that creates more problems than it solves because of packed rooms and long lines to get into sessions, though. Now that I’ve had a while to think about it, it seems unlikely that Apple would risk making the conference worse just to squeeze in another 500 developers.</p>
<p>Could there be some creative layouts in Moscone West that Apple hasn’t tried yet? There are so many downsides to changing the venue that I want to believe it’s part of addressing the biggest issue with the conference: most people don’t win the ticket lottery.</p>
<p>There’s still the problem of hotels. Linking to my post about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/04/dont-give-up-on-wwdc.html">not giving up on WWDC</a>, John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/04/20/reece-wwdc">singled out Airbnb</a> as a bad solution, since there just aren’t that many rooms available. That’s true. And even worse, potential <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobgorban/status/722889126870065156">last-minute cancellations</a> make Airbnb less reliable. Where I said Airbnb, I should have just said “cheaper hotel”.</p>
<p>(Alex Cash also has <a href="http://alex.cash/saving-on-wwdc/">tips for saving money at WWDC</a>. Casey Liss has a <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2016/4/20/much-ado-about-wwdc">good post about rising hotel prices</a>.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I know some developers are using Airbnb this year, and I’d like to try it next year for a change of pace and scenery away from the conference. With the convenience of Uber, the risk of settling for a place farther away seems low.</p>
<p>And finally, I’ve enjoyed many recent podcasts about WWDC. Two highlights: <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/24">Under the Radar episode 24</a>, where Marco Arment and David Smith share their thoughts on whether to attend the conference; and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/tc/12">Thoroughly Considered 12</a>, about not just WWDC but the value of attending or exhibiting at conferences as a company.</p>

For a while I&#8217;ve felt like there could be something interesting in a very short podcast, where I talk a little about what I&#8217;m working on or thinking about throughout the week. Each episode is going to be just 3-5 minutes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/">Timetable</a>. I&#8217;ve published 3 episodes, and have a 4th that will go out later today. I think of it as a &#8220;microcast&#8221;, complementing the informal nature of my microblog posts. And just as I have longer essays on my weblog, of course I&#8217;ll continue to explore larger topics for indie Mac and iOS developers on <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> with Daniel Jalkut.</p>
<p>If you check it out, let me know what you think at <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">manton@manton.org</a>. Thanks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve become quite the fan of WordPress and Automattic over the last year, since <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/thank-you-movable-type.html">finally switching</a>. WordPress still has some problems — mostly in self-hosted web admin performance, and the clunkiness of editing themes — but Automattic is a good company. Around web publishing and hosting, I think 2 platforms are going to last for decades: GitHub and WordPress.</p>
<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/interviews-matt-mullenweg/">There&#8217;s a great interview</a> with Automattic founder Matt Mullenweg on the Post Status podcast:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I had the opportunity to interview Matt Mullenweg about an ambitious project that included more than a year and a half of development to create an all new WordPress.com interface, both for the web and a desktop app. The project was codenamed Calypso, and we talked about many aspects of Calypso, as well as a variety of subjects that relate to it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>After listening to this episode, I&#8217;ve subscribed to the podcast. Looking forward to being a little more aware of what is going on in the WordPress community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/stars-vs-hearts-and-twitters-decline.html">replying to podcast topics with blog posts</a>, I have some comments after listening to a recent <a href="http://www.relay.fm/clockwise/111">Clockwise</a>. It was another great episode, featuring hosts Jason Snell and Dan Moren, and guests Christina Warren and Susie Ochs.</p>
<p>The panel was split on the likelihood of a new 4-inch iPhone from Apple. Apple is a company of patterns, so it seems counterintuitive that they&#8217;d release a new phone in the Winter or Spring instead of the Fall. But doing so has a couple of nice advantages: first, you can bump up an otherwise slow sales quarter with a new product; and second, you don&#8217;t hurt sales of the primary iPhones (the 6S and 6S Plus) by confusing buyers with another choice. Customers perfectly happy with their iPhone 6 from last year, and who were planning on buying a 6S as a natural upgrade, now would be faced with an unexpected choice in screen size if the 4-inch phone had been announced alongside the 6S.</p>
<p>Everyone also seems to forget about <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/">the newest 4-inch iPod Touch</a>. It went on sale in July, features an A8 processor, better camera than the iPhone 5S, and sells for only $199. It&#8217;s easy to imagine Apple basing a new 4-inch iPhone on this design, reusing both the screen and many of the internal components from the iPod Touch.</p>
<p>Apple has sold a lot of iPhone 6 and 6S phones. But there are also a lot of 4-inch devices out in the world: of course the iPhone 5, 5C, and 5S, but also every iPod Touch sold in the last few years. There are many people who would love to replace their old phone with a new one that&#8217;s better and faster, but not bigger.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was interviewed for two podcasts recently. The first is <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/podcast/14">the CocoaConf Podcast</a>. Daniel Steinberg does a fantastic job of editing his show with a tight format, mixing together interviews and community news.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about my new microblogging project and working on things that matter. I told the story of shutting down my Mac app Wii Transfer to focus on other projects:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;It was really popular. I remember when I shipped 2.0 it was one of my best sales days ever, probably <em>the</em> best sales day ever. But what I came to is that as neat as it was, as useful as it was for some people, in the big scheme of things — if you take 5 years out, 10 years out — that app just wasn&#8217;t that important. It was neat, but it&#8217;s time had come and gone.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The other podcast I was on is a new one called <a href="http://consultpodcast.com/post/128140298572/episode-3-manton-reece-david-interviews-manton">Consult</a>. It&#8217;s an interview show all about consulting and client work. I had a good time chatting with host David Kopec about evolving Riverfold Software to <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/consulting/">include consulting</a> while at the same time expanding into a full-time indie business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week at <a href="http://twitter.com/nsdrinking">NSDrinking</a> we had one of our biggest turnouts yet. At one point, we’re talking about programming jobs, meetups, and Apple, and Jordan Breeding was mentioned. Not in the context of having passed away, but just in remembering something he had said or done. A stranger listening to the conversation would have no idea that Jordan wasn’t still a member of the community.</p>
<p>This struck me as exactly right. I think anyone would would want to be remembered as <em>who they were</em>, not how they left us.</p>
<p>Like many in our developer community, I&#8217;ve thought about Jordan Breeding at certain moments over the last couple months. <a href="http://www.patrickburleson.com/2015/02/09/remembering-jordan-breeding/">Patrick Burleson shared a story</a> about his close friend:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “For those that knew Jordan, they know that he was a incredibly generous and caring person. He did so many things for so many people, it’s a wonder he ever got anything else done.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ideveloper.co/podcast135/">Episode 135 of the iDeveloper podcast</a> opened with a segment remembering Jordan. Scotty and John did a great job of capturing what he meant to the community. Scotty says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Everybody has said really the same things about him. Firstly, how clever he was. He was an incredibly intelligent person. But secondly, how generous and humble he was with that intelligence, and how he shared with people. He always made you feel like you could be better, and do better, and was always having a laugh about things.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Guy English also dedicated <a href="http://www.imore.com/60-melton-ganatra-episode-iii-shipping-software">episode 60 of the Debug podcast</a> to Jordan. <a href="http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/514">On his blog</a> he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Good guy. I didn’t know him well but he always struck me as someone I’d like to get to know better. I lost out on that and too many others did too. Those who knew him universally loved him.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Kyle Richter worked with Jordan and <a href="http://kylerichter.com/jordan/">had this to say</a>, echoing Patrick’s quote above about how Jordan went out of his way for other people:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We were having dinner with some friends in California and my iPhone was acting up. Jordan volunteered to break away from the pack and come to the Apple Store with me. You rarely get to pick your last time with a friend, my last time with Jordan was him fighting with the Apple Store staff on my behalf. That was Jordan, even with everything he was going through he never thought of himself first.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://storify.com/gruber/jordan-breeding">a collection of tweets</a> via John Gruber. You know when reading any of these that Jordan will be remembered for a long time. He accomplished a great deal and went far, quickly, and that progress is a personal inspiration whenever I consider accelerating the change in my own career. Carpe diem.</p>

First, <a href="http://preservationstate.com/027-a-manton-reece-nerd-pocket/">on Preservation State with Philip Mozolak and Christopher Radliff</a>, we talked for an hour about App.net, Beats Music, and more. It was fun to do a longer podcast that’s free to kind of meander through different topics, and I think we covered a lot.</p>
<p>Next, <a href="http://www.appstorypodcast.com/apps/sunlit">on App Stories</a>, Vic Hudson interviewed me about how Sunlit came to be. We talk about App.net, design choices in Sunlit, and the future for the app. There’s a lot in there that I’ve never talked about before. Hope you enjoy these episodes!</p>
