				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m launching a new podcast today. For a while I&#8217;ve felt like there could be something interesting in a very short podcast, where I talk a little about what I&#8217;m working on or thinking about throughout the week. Each episode is going to be just 3-5 minutes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/">Timetable</a>. I&#8217;ve published 3 episodes, and have a 4th that will go out later today. I think of it as a &#8220;microcast&#8221;, complementing the informal nature of my microblog posts. And just as I have longer essays on my weblog, of course I&#8217;ll continue to explore larger topics for indie Mac and iOS developers on <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> with Daniel Jalkut.</p>
<p>If you check it out, let me know what you think at <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">manton@manton.org</a>. Thanks!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve become quite the fan of WordPress and Automattic over the last year, since <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/thank-you-movable-type.html">finally switching</a>. WordPress still has some problems — mostly in self-hosted web admin performance, and the clunkiness of editing themes — but Automattic is a good company. Around web publishing and hosting, I think 2 platforms are going to last for decades: GitHub and WordPress.</p>
<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/interviews-matt-mullenweg/">There&#8217;s a great interview</a> with Automattic founder Matt Mullenweg on the Post Status podcast:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I had the opportunity to interview Matt Mullenweg about an ambitious project that included more than a year and a half of development to create an all new WordPress.com interface, both for the web and a desktop app. The project was codenamed Calypso, and we talked about many aspects of Calypso, as well as a variety of subjects that relate to it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>After listening to this episode, I&#8217;ve subscribed to the podcast. Looking forward to being a little more aware of what is going on in the WordPress community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the spirit of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/stars-vs-hearts-and-twitters-decline.html">replying to podcast topics with blog posts</a>, I have some comments after listening to a recent <a href="http://www.relay.fm/clockwise/111">Clockwise</a>. It was another great episode, featuring hosts Jason Snell and Dan Moren, and guests Christina Warren and Susie Ochs.</p>
<p>The panel was split on the likelihood of a new 4-inch iPhone from Apple. Apple is a company of patterns, so it seems counterintuitive that they&#8217;d release a new phone in the Winter or Spring instead of the Fall. But doing so has a couple of nice advantages: first, you can bump up an otherwise slow sales quarter with a new product; and second, you don&#8217;t hurt sales of the primary iPhones (the 6S and 6S Plus) by confusing buyers with another choice. Customers perfectly happy with their iPhone 6 from last year, and who were planning on buying a 6S as a natural upgrade, now would be faced with an unexpected choice in screen size if the 4-inch phone had been announced alongside the 6S.</p>
<p>Everyone also seems to forget about <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/">the newest 4-inch iPod Touch</a>. It went on sale in July, features an A8 processor, better camera than the iPhone 5S, and sells for only $199. It&#8217;s easy to imagine Apple basing a new 4-inch iPhone on this design, reusing both the screen and many of the internal components from the iPod Touch.</p>
<p>Apple has sold a lot of iPhone 6 and 6S phones. But there are also a lot of 4-inch devices out in the world: of course the iPhone 5, 5C, and 5S, but also every iPod Touch sold in the last few years. There are many people who would love to replace their old phone with a new one that&#8217;s better and faster, but not bigger.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was interviewed for two podcasts recently. The first is <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/podcast/14">the CocoaConf Podcast</a>. Daniel Steinberg does a fantastic job of editing his show with a tight format, mixing together interviews and community news.</p>
<p>We talked a lot about my new microblogging project and working on things that matter. I told the story of shutting down my Mac app Wii Transfer to focus on other projects:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;It was really popular. I remember when I shipped 2.0 it was one of my best sales days ever, probably <em>the</em> best sales day ever. But what I came to is that as neat as it was, as useful as it was for some people, in the big scheme of things — if you take 5 years out, 10 years out — that app just wasn&#8217;t that important. It was neat, but it&#8217;s time had come and gone.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The other podcast I was on is a new one called <a href="http://consultpodcast.com/post/128140298572/episode-3-manton-reece-david-interviews-manton">Consult</a>. It&#8217;s an interview show all about consulting and client work. I had a good time chatting with host David Kopec about evolving Riverfold Software to <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/consulting/">include consulting</a> while at the same time expanding into a full-time indie business.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week at <a href="http://twitter.com/nsdrinking">NSDrinking</a> we had one of our biggest turnouts yet. At one point, we’re talking about programming jobs, meetups, and Apple, and Jordan Breeding was mentioned. Not in the context of having passed away, but just in remembering something he had said or done. A stranger listening to the conversation would have no idea that Jordan wasn’t still a member of the community.</p>
<p>This struck me as exactly right. I think anyone would would want to be remembered as <em>who they were</em>, not how they left us.</p>
<p>Like many in our developer community, I&#8217;ve thought about Jordan Breeding at certain moments over the last couple months. <a href="http://www.patrickburleson.com/2015/02/09/remembering-jordan-breeding/">Patrick Burleson shared a story</a> about his close friend:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “For those that knew Jordan, they know that he was a incredibly generous and caring person. He did so many things for so many people, it’s a wonder he ever got anything else done.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://ideveloper.co/podcast135/">Episode 135 of the iDeveloper podcast</a> opened with a segment remembering Jordan. Scotty and John did a great job of capturing what he meant to the community. Scotty says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Everybody has said really the same things about him. Firstly, how clever he was. He was an incredibly intelligent person. But secondly, how generous and humble he was with that intelligence, and how he shared with people. He always made you feel like you could be better, and do better, and was always having a laugh about things.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Guy English also dedicated <a href="http://www.imore.com/60-melton-ganatra-episode-iii-shipping-software">episode 60 of the Debug podcast</a> to Jordan. <a href="http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/514">On his blog</a> he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Good guy. I didn’t know him well but he always struck me as someone I’d like to get to know better. I lost out on that and too many others did too. Those who knew him universally loved him.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Kyle Richter worked with Jordan and <a href="http://kylerichter.com/jordan/">had this to say</a>, echoing Patrick’s quote above about how Jordan went out of his way for other people:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We were having dinner with some friends in California and my iPhone was acting up. Jordan volunteered to break away from the pack and come to the Apple Store with me. You rarely get to pick your last time with a friend, my last time with Jordan was him fighting with the Apple Store staff on my behalf. That was Jordan, even with everything he was going through he never thought of himself first.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://storify.com/gruber/jordan-breeding">a collection of tweets</a> via John Gruber. You know when reading any of these that Jordan will be remembered for a long time. He accomplished a great deal and went far, quickly, and that progress is a personal inspiration whenever I consider accelerating the change in my own career. Carpe diem.</p>

<p>Next, <a href="http://www.appstorypodcast.com/apps/sunlit">on App Stories</a>, Vic Hudson interviewed me about how Sunlit came to be. We talk about App.net, design choices in Sunlit, and the future for the app. There’s a lot in there that I’ve never talked about before. Hope you enjoy these episodes!</p>

Funny thing about starting early and just sitting down to do work every day or week: eventually you <a href="http://manton.org/2008/10/slowgrowing_trees.html">end up with something big</a>.</p>
<p>On <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2014/04/episode-135-an-unfair-advantage-in-a-good-way/">this week’s show</a>, Daniel and I talked about Apple’s stock, rumors of a search engine, and a follow-up on my Twitter ads experiment. I like how this episode turned out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My friend Daniel Jalkut has launched his new podcast, <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/podcast/episode-1-guy-english/">Bitsplitting</a>. The first episode is an interview with Guy English, and future episodes will follow a similar interview format with other developers and tech folks. I especially love that it’s an interview show because Daniel and I were never able to coordinate having regular guests on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>. I think it makes a great complement to our show or one of your other favorite podcasts.</p>
<p>And it’s a great time for developer podcasts! Some of my other recent favorites include <a href="http://www.imore.com/category/debug">Debug</a>, <a href="http://identicalcousins.net/">Identical Cousins</a>, and the new show from Marco Arment, Casey Liss, and John Siracusa, <a href="http://atp.fm/">Accidental Tech Podcast</a>. Plus old favorites like <a href="http://developingperspective.com/">Developing Perspective</a>, <a href="http://nsbrief.com/">NSBrief</a>, <a href="http://ideveloper.tv/podcast/">iDeveloper Live</a>, <a href="http://www.muleradio.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>, and another half dozen I subscribe to.</p>
<p>I talked to a few people at <a href="http://nsconference.com/">NSConference</a> last week who couldn’t get podcasts worked into their routine. If that’s you, consider that you may actually be missing out on some great content now. Even if you don’t have a commute to listen during, try picking up the earbuds next time you go for a walk or work outside or do the dishes or whatever else away from the computer. Those are the perfect times to listen to a good show, and <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/podcast/episode-1-guy-english/">Daniel’s</a> is a great one to start with.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Podcasts are more popular than ever. We&#8217;re lucky right now to have a bunch of podcast networks and great iOS clients, including the newly-released <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/podcasts/id525463029?mt=8">official Podcasts app from Apple</a>. My favorite remains <a href="http://vemedio.com/instacast">Instacast on iPhone</a>, but there are other good choices like <a href="http://www.downcastapp.com/">Downcast</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s never easy for developers when Apple arrives into your market with free competition, especially if it might one day be bundled on the OS alongside the Music and Videos apps. I wish the third-party guys the best of luck.</p>
<p>But for podcast creators, the extra exposure can only be a good thing. I hope we can welcome even more listeners to our Core Intuition podcast. We just opened a new way to send in feedback and questions, too: <a href="http://glassboard.com/">Glassboard</a>. Use invite code COREINT on the web or iPhone app to join the board and get a little behind-the-scenes look into the podcast.</p>
