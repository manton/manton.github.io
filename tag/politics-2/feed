				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I woke up early the day after the election, thinking about my daughters, and cried. I had been so excited to celebrate our new president with them. I had been so excited to watch the returns with my kids, to share a moment of pride and optimism.</p>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t a normal election. This wasn&#8217;t just a debate over policy. It was much deeper. The world is already worse and darker <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/796417517157830656">for many people</a> because of what happened.</p>
<p>There will be arguments over why the election went so wrong, but it&#8217;s more complicated than just one thing. There was the overplayed story about private emails. There was the FBI letter. There was the media treating Trump like a reality TV star instead of a threat.</p>
<p>Hillary did her job. She destroyed Trump in all 3 debates. She ran a solid campaign. But she has always been held to a different standard than everyone else. I&#8217;ll never get over that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m proud to have voted for Hillary in the primary and in the general election, and I&#8217;d do both again. This election was very close. It was winnable. If we had ignored the polls and fought for every state, it was winnable.</p>
<p>Friday night, I went with a friend to see <a href="http://www.trevornoah.com/shows/">Trevor Noah&#8217;s standup show</a>. It was great to laugh for a couple hours, about the election and everyday life. But then the night fades and we&#8217;re still in a nightmare.</p>
<p>After Hillary has had some time to rest, and reflect, and <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/11/mother-and-daughter-run-into-hillary-clinton-hiking-facebook.html">be her own person</a> again, I hope she can find another cause worth fighting for. Let&#8217;s not forget that she did make history as the first woman to be nominated by a major party. She paved the way and reminded us how hard this is. That matters.</p>
<p>Daniel and I recorded <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/11/episode-258-not-just-a-normal-day/">an episode of Core Intuition</a> the day after the election. We tried to capture that feeling of loss, and anger, but also of hope that we can have a renewed passion for our apps and ideas. Maybe some of our products have a place in the work to do before 2018.</p>
<p>Hillary said <a href="https://medium.com/@HillaryClinton/thank-you-d2decf198a69">in her speech</a>, the day after the election:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Donald Trump is going to be our president. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On this, I disagree with Hillary. Trump has already shown us who he is — someone who mistreats women, lashes out at his critics, and disrespects immigrants — and nothing he does in office will change that. The only thing we owe him is a short presidency.</p>

		<title>Cuts in Core Intuition</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When producing &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ we generally record more than we need, giving us flexibility to cut out the rambling tangents, technical errors, and frequent &#8220;uhms&#8221; that threaten to destroy any kind of pacing or interest in the show. The decision of what to leave out is just as important as the original source work &mdash; being able to recognize the best parts that add value vs. the fluff that can be dropped to make the whole thing stronger. It&#8217;s that way with any product, not just podcasts.</p>
<p>For episode 8, posted this morning, we ended up recording even more than usual, so we cut a batch of insignificant things but also a few good points in an effort to bring the podcast down to something closer to 30 minutes. I wanted to gather a few of those lost topics here.</p>
<p><b>Politics</b>. We recorded the show Friday before the first presidential debate, so it only made sense to discuss the campaign. Core Intuition started before the Democratic primaries were officially over, during which time Daniel and I were quite vocal on Twitter and blogs about the election. It still surprises me that we haven&#8217;t let politics get into the show. Probably for the best.</p>
<p><b>SXSW</b>. I talked more about the SXSW Interactive festival, from its beginnings in the 1990s as a multimedia show to the current mix of web, social media, and design. Some of the most interesting talks in the last couple of years trended away away from &#8220;5 experts on a panel&#8221; sessions to more formal talks, by speakers who love SXSW and don&#8217;t want to see it fall into mediocrity. While it&#8217;s not a developer conference, there has been a steady attendance increase from web application developers and even Mac developers.</p>
<p><b>TED</b>. Daniel commented on the 20-minute sessions at &#8220;TED&#8221;:http://www.ted.com/, and how any conference would benefit from this focused approach. Imagine how much more useful sessions at WWDC would be if the speakers cruised through their technical slides in 20 minutes and then left much more time for Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>So those were a few of the segments we left out. The final show included a wrap-up of the C4 conference, insight from Daniel&#8217;s &#8220;Shush&#8221; iPhone app, and rants on Google Android and user experience. &#8220;Check it out&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Hillary won Ohio, Texas, and Rhode Island last month, I decided it was time to think less about actively supporting my own candidate, who clearly wasn&#8217;t going away, and more about the future of the Democratic Party and what it would take to come together when a nominee is chosen. I had been quick to defend Hillary on Twitter and in blog comments, but the more I considered the close race and the long month until the next primary in Pennsylvania, now finally here, the more convinced I became that a joint ticket is the answer to a unified party.</p>
<p>Rather than bicker with my friends who support Obama, I changed my tone to emphasize our shared values and launched a new site: &#8220;unitetheparty.com&#8221;:http://www.unitetheparty.com/. I&#8217;ve been posting there regularly since March, and hope to build a group of like-minded Democrats to write on this topic, as well as a list of supporters who want to see a joint ticket happen.</p>
<p>Thinking about the endgame of the race in this context provides an excellent backdrop for discussing the real issues important to voters. There&#8217;s still an opportunity to use these campaigns for good: setting the right tone against McCain and bringing awareness of the Democratic agenda to everyone.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Need something to listen to on your iPod while waiting in line to vote today? Try out these fantastic recent episodes of two of my favorite podcasts for animators and animation fans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spline Cast with Ed Catmull&#8221;:http://splinedoctors.blogspot.com/2007/11/original-spline-doctor.html. I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;ve followed the careers of John Lasseter and Steve Jobs a lot closer than I have for Ed Catmull, but this podcast shows pretty clearly the depth of impact Ed Catmull has had on the computer industry and the Pixar culture. It&#8217;s a great listen not just for anyone who cares about animation, but also for entrepreneurs who want a look into how you stay successful year after year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Animation Podcast with James Baxter&#8221;:http://animationpodcast.com/archives/2008/02/04/james-baxter-part-one/. There are many great animators, from well known independents who receive Oscar recognition to those who work 12-hour days in relative obscurity at a big studio, but there are only a handful of true masters of the art form. Baxter is one of my favorites. The powerful sequence with Moses and the burning bush and the mannerism of Belle fixing her hair were both always really memorable for me.</p>
<p>Enjoy! Happy Super Tuesday.</p>
