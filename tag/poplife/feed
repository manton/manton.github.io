				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shutting down a web site correctly isn&#8217;t easy. When <a href="https://medium.com/talkshow/we-are-shutting-down-talkshow-on-december-1-98ea1dacf3c8">Talkshow announced</a> they were closing, I was surprised. Six months is a limited time to launch, get traction, and then wind down. But I was glad that they&#8217;d let any show be exported as an archive.</p>
<p>The archives aren&#8217;t available for very long. If you hosted a show on Talkshow, you have until December 1st to download it.</p>
<p>I downloaded a couple to see how Talkshow handled it. Just in case no one else grabs them, I&#8217;m copying them here: <a href="http://www.manton.org/archive/talkshow.im/poplife/">Pop Life episode 5</a> with Anil Dash and guest John Gruber, and the <a href="http://www.manton.org/archive/talkshow.im/sixcolors/">Six Colors live coverage</a> for Apple&#8217;s September 7th event. I had Instapaper-ed both of these to read later anyway.</p>
<p>The archive itself is a simple .zip file with HTML, CSS, and user profile images. In the Finder it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2016/talkshow_im.png" width="600" height="475" alt="Talkshow.im Finder screenshot" /></p>
<p>This self-contained structure makes it very easy to re-share somewhere else. Credit to Talkshow for keeping this simple. But it also strikes me as so easy to keep hosting as static files, I wonder why Talkshow doesn&#8217;t keep the archives available indefinitely, which would preserve any existing links to these shows from the web.</p>
