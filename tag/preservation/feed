				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is kind of a short, technical footnote to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">my last essay</a>. There I linked to an older blog post from Dave Winer, just one of many of his on this subject. Today <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/07/20/moreOnLocAndTwitter.html">he writes how we should archive blogs</a> before we worry about Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With Twitter there’s a rich corporation minding it. They can and imho should be funding their own archive. But with the historic blogosphere, dating back to the early-mid 90s, <em>a lot of it is already gone</em>. The need to preserve it, by independent historians and librarians, is greater than the need for Twitter to be publicly archived.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a lot to say on this, and I can&#8217;t wait to share a new web project that I started recently which could play a small roll in blog backups. When I killed off my little app Wii Transfer, I did so to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/05/saying_goodbye_to.html">refocus Riverfold around preservation</a>. I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It also doesn’t fit into a new theme I have for Riverfold: apps that are all about keeping and remembering what matters. For Clipstart, that’s family videos. For Tweet Library and Tweet Marker Plus, that’s old tweets.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Dave mentions libraries several times in his blog post. It’s no accident that the word “library” is in Tweet Library’s name; my ambition for this app far outpaces my coding speed. But blogs are a different problem, and they need something special — perhaps multiple solutions.</p>
