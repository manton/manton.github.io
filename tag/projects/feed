				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brent Simmons, still an Omni employee, has decided to <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/06/02/resigning_from_q_branch">part ways with his Q Branch founders</a> to focus on a new project. The whole essay is an important read, but especially this part:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I turned 47 a little while ago, and I’ve had some reasons to reflect on the shortness of life, and I realized how very important it is for me to work on the software that I think about every day. I kept putting it off, but every day that I put it off hurt more than the previous day. I realized that I couldn’t continue — I have to do the work that I <em>need</em> to do.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think many of us can relate to this. I don’t personally have a single piece of software in mind that has been nagging at me, but I have had a sense for a couple years that everything I work on needs to be something that matters to me. Having a theme across projects has also been a great way to judge what to spend time on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We planted some trees in our front yard recently. They take decades to grow, and we are under no illusion that they&#8217;ll provide meaningful shade before our children have families of their own. It&#8217;s easy to say: &#8220;Why should I bother? It will take too long before we can see results.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s like anything &mdash; the sooner you start, the less time you have to wait until that thing is mature.</p>
<p>If you procrastinate forever, just because you won&#8217;t see results anytime soon, you&#8217;ll find yourself looking back 10 years later and wishing <em>if only I had just planted that tree / started that new software project, it would have been done by now</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, don&#8217;t let the weight of potential work stop you from doing the right thing.</p>
