				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month I tore down the rotting privacy fence in our backyard and built a new low spaced-picket fence. In addition to just being ugly to look at and nearly collapsed in a few places, the old fence was tall and prevented us from enjoying the space behind our house: essentially a private park owned by a local church but also accessible to the neighborhood.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/155794959"><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2006/fence_small.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="new fence" border="1" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="10" /></a> It took me a week of part-time work and numerous Home Depot trips to build the new fence, which is about 60 feet across. I was able to salvage the strongest of the existing posts, cutting them off to match the new fence height. The ones that were rotten I removed and replaced by laying several new posts in concrete. I measured and cut each post so that the top of the fence line was level even though the ground slopped up slightly on one side of the yard.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very happy with the way it turned out. It opened the yard up even more than I was hoping for, and the better gate makes it easy to take a walk in the back. Another side effect I had not expected was encountering new people who routinely take their dogs for walks. Having a shorter fence is similar to parking your car in the driveway instead of your garage: you&#8217;ll see your neighbors more if you do.</p>
<p>Anyway, a very rewarding experience. After so much crafting code and pushing pixels, it&#8217;s nice to build something real and see the results. The &#8220;image on Flickr&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/155794959/ is one I took a few evenings ago and shows about half the full fence length.</p>
