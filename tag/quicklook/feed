				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mike Ash has been rocking with his weekly Friday Q&amp;As. From the &#8220;latest about using private APIs&#8221;:http://www.mikeash.com/?page=pyblog/friday-qa-2009-01-02.html:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Remember that the cost is not just to you, but to your users. If you&#8217;re really unlucky the break will be so bad that it&#8217;s not even obvious that it&#8217;s your fault, and they&#8217;ll figure it out only after much head-scratching. Once they do figure it out, they will hate you if your fix doesn&#8217;t come really fast.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>My new app (not officially announced yet &mdash; more later) currently uses Quick Look as a significant part of the user interface. Quick Look is a private API on 10.5, but my hope was that surely it would be made public by 10.6. If I coded correctly for both cases (I have a 10.6 seed running here I can test against), then I could safely release the product and be reasonably certain that nothing would be break.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now rethinking that, both because it looks increasingly like Quick Look will remain a private API even in Snow Leopard, and because I&#8217;ve gotten feedback that it&#8217;s not a perfect fit for how I&#8217;m using it anyway. At the very least I will turn Quick Look into a secondary option, something that wouldn&#8217;t be missed if it went away, and roll my own preview UI to be the default.</p>
