				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’ve been really happy to see the reviews of Sunlit popping up around the web. With a new type of app like this, there’s always the risk that people won’t <em>get</em> it. But that hasn’t been a problem at all. I’ve included some quotes below.</p>
<p>Jon Russell on <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/01/18/sunlit-for-ios-is-a-neat-journaling-app-that-lets-you-easily-curate-and-share-photo-stories/">The Next Web</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The design is beautifully clean and the app is easy to navigate. [&#8230;] Sunlit is an easy way to curate a collection of images that you actually want to share.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Federico Viticci on <a href="http://www.macstories.net/linked/sunlit/">MacStories</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “You choose some photos that ‘tell a story’ – could be a trip, a family gathering, anything you want to remember – and the app pulls in their metadata for date and location. You can add text comments to jot down memories, import photos from Dropbox if you don’t keep them in the Camera Roll, and even add check-ins manually, from Foursquare, or from Steve Streza’s <a href="http://ohaiapp.net/">Ohai</a> app.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>John Gruber on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/01/22/sunlit">Daring Fireball</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Sunlit has an interesting collaboration and sync model, based on App.net, and a clever integration of maps. You can publish stories on the web, but most of the features are geared toward private group sharing and collaboration through the app.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thorin Klosowski on <a href="http://lifehacker.com/sunlit-automatically-makes-a-photo-journal-using-app-ne-1503461536">Lifehacker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The app itself is great looking and provides fantastic maps to go along with your photos as well as a place to write down any thoughts you might have.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Charlie Sorrel on <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/262817/sunlit-app-builds-photo-journals-using-dopbox-app-net-and-foursquare/">Cult of Mac</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Apps like Sunlit make sharing your pictures easy, fun and fast.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to everyone who tried the app and told people about it. Version 1.0.1 was approved this week, and you can <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/sunlit/id690924901?mt=8">download it for free</a> and upgrade inside the app. Enjoy!</p>
