				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple Music launched today with iOS 8.4. Christina Warren has <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/06/30/apple-music-hands-on/">an early review for Mashable</a>, in particular mentioning the value of For You:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The real heart of Apple Music is the For You tab. This is basically your music homescreen. When you open the section for the first time, you&#8217;re asked to go through a discovery exercise. This was lifted directly from Beats Music and it&#8217;s one of the best discovery tools I&#8217;ve used over the years.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>If Apple Music can be thought of as Beats Music 2.0, then the Connect tab is probably a little like Ping 2.0, an update on Apple’s first attempt to build a music-only social network. As Daniel and I discussed <a href="http://coreint.org/187">on Core Intuition 187</a>, any service that demonstrates a network effect — everything from eBay to Twitter — needs some critical mass of users to reach its potential. I was curious whether Apple could achieve this if the Connect feature was locked behind a paid subscription after the initial 3-month trial.</p>
<p>What I missed is that Connect and even Beats 1 will be free. From the <a href="http://www.apple.com/music/">Apple Music page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Even without a membership, you can listen to Beats 1 radio, see what artists are posting on Connect, and hear our ad‑supported stations.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Beats 1 is one of the more interesting aspects of Apple Music to me. I just signed up for the trial and plan to continue at the $15/month family subscription.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2004/03/thank_you_radio.html">10 years ago</a> I switched this blog from Radio Userland to Movable Type. Looking back, it&#8217;s incredible how mature the software was at the time that it could last this long. I didn&#8217;t stay current with updates; the version I was running was ancient by any standard.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m planning some new blog-related experiments soon, so it was time to migrate to a new blogging app. While I still prefer static publishing, after evaluating a bunch of options I ended up going with WordPress. I don&#8217;t love it, but it has one feature that is more important than anything else: I&#8217;m fairly confident it will be around and well-supported 10 years from now. <a href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/with-great-joy/">Rands recently</a> made a similar choice.</p>
<p>I preserved every blog post URL from the previous version of the site so that links don&#8217;t break. This wasn&#8217;t trivial. For a time it had me lost into the darkness of writing WordPress plug-ins, which didn&#8217;t work anyway, before finally coming to my senses and writing a script to post-process all the Movable Type titles into custom slugs.</p>
<p>The RSS feed is also the same, but not the RSS item GUIDs. This means you&#8217;ll probably have a one-time &#8220;mark all as read&#8221; in your favorite news reader. Apologies, but it was either that or never ship the new site.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a little bit of cleanup and design work still to do. The site already looks much better on mobile devices, though. I&#8217;m excited to get back into regular blogging.</p>
