				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I mentioned when <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/10/core-intuition-202-and-thoroughly-considered-and-stickers.html">I first linked to Studio Neat’s Obi project on Kickstarter</a>, I enjoyed the Thoroughly Considered podcast that came out of that endeavor. It’s now one of my favorites.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.relay.fm/tc/10">the latest show</a>, Dan and Tom and Myke talk about the press: getting press for your product, communicating with press folks, and the impact of being featured in the press. Because Studio Neat makes physical products and not just software, their take on these topics is always good.</p>
<p>While I’ve blogged from time to time about the press, there’s a lot that I get wrong or don’t make time for. I was impressed with David Barnard’s promotion for <a href="http://randoapp.co/">Rando</a>, a new iPhone app that was a joint venture with David, designer <a href="https://twitter.com/rickmesser">Rick Messer</a>, and <a href="http://jonhays.me/">Jonathan Hays</a> and Ryan DeVore from Silverpine Software. The app got a lot of great press coverage. Even the reviewers who weren&#8217;t convinced they&#8217;d use the app couldn’t help but recommend that readers download it. Not just because of its novelty, but because David framed the app with such a clear story.</p>
<p>Self-promotion is hard for many of us. I try to remind myself that journalists <em>want something interesting to write about</em>. The community as a whole benefits when writers have good stories and developers have good traffic to their apps.</p>
<p>One of the approaches I’ve been trying with my upcoming microblog platform is to write about related topics for months before the project is officially announced. It’s great because these are things I would want to write about anyway, regardless of having an app to promote, and so the heightened level of interest from beta testers and bloggers is like a bonus. Now I just have to actually ship the product while the timing is right.</p>
