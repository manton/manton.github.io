				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alright, it&#8217;s been 2 weeks. How does the iPhone 4 hold up?</p>
<p>For me, there was less urgency to this launch then for previous iPhone releases. I wanted the 3GS on day one (video recording!) and of course I waited all afternoon for the original iPhone (shiny!). Likewise I couldn&#8217;t wait for the iPad. This time I viewed iMovie and FaceTime as the killer apps. Sign me up!</p>
<p>But I wasn&#8217;t willing to wait all day. I tried the same approach that had worked great for the iPad: show up late in the day after the madness has settled down. No luck this time. I waited about half an hour, then came back before closing and waited a couple more hours to get a voucher for the next day. Total wait time about 3.5 hours over 2 days and 3 visits.</p>
<p>To get it on day 1, most people waited 6 hours. I&#8217;m sure &#8220;John Gruber&#8217;s story on Flickr&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/4731689070/in/contacts/ was common too.</p>
<p>This was Apple&#8217;s most poorly-managed launch I&#8217;ve been to. The 3GS line was pretty fast. For iPad it was extremely quick &mdash; in and out in half an hour. I mostly blame the extra step of requiring activation in-store, but there were enough problems that I think this whole thing was mismanaged somewhere.</p>
<p>Some of the inconsistent messages I heard depending on which Apple Store employee I talked to:</p>
<ul>
<li>AT&amp;T activation is not the bottleneck / yes it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are selling 30 phones every 10 minutes / no idea how long the wait is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We&#8217;ll shut down the line at 7pm and give out vouchers / staying open until 2am.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vouchers will allow you to skip everyone else in line the next day / you&#8217;re guaranteed a phone but have to wait in line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also &#8220;collected a few tweets about the launch&#8221;:http://tweetlib.com/manton/iphone4.</p>
<p>Anyway, the phone. It&#8217;s the best phone I&#8217;ve ever seen. No question.</p>
<p>Now that some time has passed, I think I can comment on the reception issue. It&#8217;s real. Outside my house, I don&#8217;t notice it. But my street is a notoriously bad dead zone, and while I don&#8217;t get any more dropped calls than I used to, I can no longer hold the phone in the palm of my left hand when using mobile Safari. It&#8217;s pretty frustrating because I&#8217;ve been holding the phone this way for 3 years. It&#8217;s awkward to break the habit.</p>
<p>Having said that, I&#8217;ll close with the same thing I told strangers who came up asking about the phone. It&#8217;s easy to overlook the reception issue because of how great the rest of the phone is, and all existing iPhone users will love the iPhone 4. Eventually I&#8217;ll just cave in and buy a bumper.</p>
