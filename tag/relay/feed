				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.caseyliss.com/2015/8/17/a-year-of-relay-fm">Casey Liss summarizes</a> the excellent first year of new podcast network Relay FM:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Last year, I was deeply honored to be invited to be part of the launch shows on Relay. This year, I’m deeply honored to be a part of a network that not only airs some of the best spoken word programming on the internet, but also cares so deeply about being more inclusive.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Congratulations to all the podcast hosts, and of course to Relay founders Myke Hurley and Stephen Hackett. <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/8/how-im-spending-my-indie-time">Stephen posted</a> about how his time as an indie is going:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The hours break down about how I felt they would break down, with Relay FM taking up about half my time and everything else going down from there. I suspect that consulting number will shrink as I wrap up some stuff for my former employer, but for now, I think this balance works. It&#8217;s a decent reflection of where my income is, which is encouraging.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Rewinding a few weeks, <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/8/whole-ass-one-thing">this is what he had to say</a> about the shift to indie work:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;It’s profoundly surreal, but incredibly freeing, to be focused on my writing and podcasting full-time. There’s still lots to work out with budgets and time management and extra things I could take on, but it’s all under the category of <em>my</em> work. That’s what makes it so much fun, despite the unknowns.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to watch the rise of podcast networks. It has now been a little over 5 years since I <a href="http://www.manton.org/2010/02/5_by_5.html">first wrote about the 5by5 launch</a>. Daniel and I will probably keep <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> independent forever, but I hope that the continued success of larger networks means that the overall podcast market is still growing.</p>
