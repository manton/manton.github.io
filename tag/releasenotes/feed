				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best blog posts we write are as much for ourselves as for our readers. That&#8217;s one of the traits that makes personal blogging so special.</p>
<p>I published <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/10/a-great-developer-can-come-from-anywhere.html">my essay last week</a> from the hotel at <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/conference">Release Notes</a>, right before heading downstairs as the conference got underway. Almost no one had read it yet, but the essay still helped me because it made me even more aware of when I accidentally monopolized a conversation. I did end up talking a lot about my new project while at Release Notes, but I also caught myself many times, making sure to turn the conversation around and <em>listen</em>.</p>
<p>And there was plenty to hear at Release Notes. I got something out of every talk and from many conversations with developers who I had never met before. Congratulations to Charles and Joe for putting together a great conference.</p>
<p>Highlights for me included Myke Hurley&#8217;s opening talk on Wednesday night about quitting his job and the first full-time year of <a href="http://www.relay.fm/">Relay FM</a>; Rob Rhyne&#8217;s fantastic whirlwind tour of accounting, which scared me a little because of everything I still don&#8217;t know about being independent; Jean MacDonald&#8217;s talk about podcast sponsorships and the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/appcamp4girls">fundraiser for App Camp for Girls</a>; Pieter Omvlee&#8217;s advice on aiming to build a bigger business; and David Smith&#8217;s talk, which I&#8217;ll get to later. I could pull out lessons from each of these talks as well as the others from Rachel Andrew, Georgia Dow, John Saddington, Chris Liscio, Daniel Pasco, and Jim Dalrymple.</p>
<p>Thursday night was the &#8220;dine around&#8221;, a clever idea to split attendees into groups of about a dozen people, each meeting for dinner at an assigned restaurant. It&#8217;s easy to fall into cliques at conferences. This was a great solution to mixing it up, all but guaranteeing that you&#8217;ll meet someone new.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth saying something about the venue. Converted from the Indianapolis Union Station, which was built in 1853, the conference center and hotel served as a beautiful backdrop to the conference. My hotel room was even made from an old train car. As we left the conference center late Friday afternoon, I took another look up at the vaulted ceiling and stained glass windows, making a mental note to read more about <a href="http://www.walkindianapolis.org/union.html">the history of the original train station</a>.</p>
<p>On Saturday I checked out of the hotel, walked up to <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/bee-coffee-roasters/51ae6176498ee875488bf40d">Bee Coffee Roasters</a> (where I ran into a couple other attendees who were also still processing everything we learned at the conference), and then took an Uber to the airport. My driver was a musician; he had toured the country playing with bands, was working on a soundtrack which he played on CD for me, and had such an optimistic take on the world that it struck me in obvious contrast to the negativity we see online sometimes.</p>
<p>And he said something that stayed with me even longer while I waited at airport security and for my flight to board. He said that everything he had wanted to do in life, he had done. Sure, he&#8217;d love to tour with another band, he&#8217;d love to find success with his new music. But already he was content. He laughed when he said he could die happy, and he was not old.</p>
<p>David Smith mentioned in his talk at Release Notes that he used to want to do everything. Have a best selling app, win a design award, be admired by his peers, and other goals that many of us share. It was only when he set out with a more singular focus — judging every decision by whether it moved his business forward so he could continue to support his family — that all the other secondary goals started taking care of themselves as well. It was a great talk and something I needed to hear.</p>
<p>As a community we&#8217;re ambitious. We want to build something amazing and we want to make a positive impact on the world. But this week was also a reminder to me that it&#8217;s okay to be more focused, to tackle niche vertical apps, or make small boring decisions that will help our business. It&#8217;s okay, even as we want to do more, to slow down and be proud and content with the path that we&#8217;re on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I wrote that <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/11/winding-down-my-twitter-apps.html">I would be removing Tweet Library from the App Store</a> at the end of December, and later said on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/01/episode-168-motorola-68k-forever/">Core Int</a> and in <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetlibrary/status/536910542288338945">a tweet</a> that there would be one last update before the app is gone. It&#8217;s well into January and the old version is still for sale. I&#8217;m over a month behind schedule but still plan to release the updated version and stop selling the app.</p>
<p>On the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/88-theyre-still-your-babies/">latest Release Notes podcast</a> there was a great discussion about when to give up on an app that isn&#8217;t making money, including a mention of my plan with Tweet Library. Joe and Charles talked about why it&#8217;s usually such a bad idea to promise features before you ship, and whether there&#8217;s an obligation to give customers any updates at all.</p>
<p>I pretty much agree with everything they said, but the upcoming Tweet Library 2.7 &#8220;features&#8221; are different. My goal with this release is for the app to be functional and stable for as long possible. I think the app needs better syncing of tweet collections to help future-proof it, to make it easier for customers to move between iOS devices when they upgrade their iPhone or iPad a year from now. For an app that is going away, I should do everything I can to make sure that a customer&#8217;s data is accessible and that import and export are as robust as possible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a reasonable question to ask why I would spend so much time working on something that will essentially bring in no additional revenue. But while it won&#8217;t directly make any money, it probably helped convince some new customers to buy the app over the last month, and it will very likely reduce the support burden for the app over the following year.</p>
<p>I also view it as a sort of parting &#8220;thank you&#8221; to my customers. It&#8217;s just the right thing to do to wrap up the app. <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/the-future-of-unison/">Panic did the same thing</a> when they stopped selling Unison, releasing a major free update at the same time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in picking up a copy of Tweet Library before it&#8217;s too late, you can <a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">buy it on the App Store for $4.99</a>. The new version should ship in early February.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I forgot to mention a few weeks back that I was a guest on <a href="http://iphreaksshow.com/039-iphreaks-show-subscription-apis-for-recurring-revenue-with-manton-reece/">the iPhreaks Show podcast</a>. The format is a panel of regulars and usually one guest, making it feel more like a roundtable discussion. They had me on to talk about subscription pricing: charging every month for your app or service.</p>
<p>Some of what we talked about was covered in 2 talks I gave last year about subscriptions, at NSConference and CocoaConf Dallas. I’ve finally pulled together the slides from these talks and put the latest version from CocoaConf <a href="http://www.manton.org/misc/Subscription_APIs_CocoaConf_2013.pdf">here as a PDF</a> (17 MB). It’s different than the NSConference one, but I think works better standalone. You can still <a href="http://my.nsconference.com">purchase the videos from NSConference 2013</a> to get my talk and many other great ones.</p>
<p>This week I was also on <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/41-manton-reece/">the Release Notes podcast</a> with Joe Cieplinski and Charles Perry. They do a great job each episode focusing on something from the business side of running an indie software company, and they’ve had some excellent guests as well. From the show notes for episode 41:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We talk about creating products vs. services, changing products from free to paid, and the advantages and challenges of subscription pricing. Manton also shares his experience in creating apps like Sunlit that build on top of other services like Twitter and App.net, his recent foray into freemium pricing, and the launch of the new Core Intuition Jobs Board.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you enjoy <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, I think you’ll really like Release Notes. Let me know if you have any feedback on the show.</p>
