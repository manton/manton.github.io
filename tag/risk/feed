				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/08/doubt-with-screenshots.html">One year ago today</a>, I posted the first screenshots of Snippets.today for iPhone. I never would&#8217;ve guessed that a year later I&#8217;d still be working on the beta, still not quite ready to ship.</p>
<p>One theme from that post a year ago is even more true today, though. To succeed I need to not just announce and market the product, but tell a story about why it matters. This realization is what has held up the Kickstarter video for so long. It doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect — I&#8217;m sure it will be flawed in a few ways — but it needs to be <em>right</em>, in that it should frame the idea of independent microblogging correctly.</p>
<p>More from that post last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>Earlier this year I gave a talk at CocoaConf about tips I’ve learned to be productive while juggling multiple projects. But as I worked on the talk, it turned out to be about something else. It was about Walt Disney moving from Kansas City to Hollywood. It was about crazy side projects that no one else believed in. It was about Texas Hold ‘Em poker and risking everything for an idea.</p></blockquote>
<p>I still feel that risk. A long-overdue product is difficult to push forward, the weight starting to carry as much burden as potential. And everywhere I look there&#8217;s a new excuse to procrastinate.</p>
