				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two new microblog-related services have launched. This week, <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/09/0995.html">Dave Winer announced River5</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “So I decided it was time to do a restart of my JavaScript RSS aggregator, and it&#8217;s now ready for Node users &#8212; it&#8217;s called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a>. [&#8230;] This is a foundation for developers to build on, but it&#8217;s also possible for an adventurous user to set up their own rivers.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>River5 is built on a few XML and JSON formats, including River.js. I’m pretty interested in River.js as a format for aggregating multiple feeds together, so I’ve supported it in my new microblog platform. As a next-generation RSS, though, I prefer the proposal I wrote about in a post called <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">RSS for microblogs</a>.</p>
<p>Next up is <a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt">twtxt</a>, which attempts to recreate Twitter as a distributed, command-line based system with self-hosted text files:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Instead of signing up at a closed and/or regulated microblogging platform, getting your status updates out with twtxt is as easy as putting them in a publicly accessible text file. The URL pointing to this file is your identity, your account. twtxt then tracks these text files, like a feedreader, and builds your unique timeline out of them, depending on which files you track.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m less sure what to think of twtxt. The simple plaintext format is nice, but we already have a good infrastructure for this with RSS. And <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/inline-links-in-microblog-posts.html">as I’ve noted before</a>, having HTML in RSS with inline styles and links is nice for microblogs, and it’s not clear to me whether that would fit well with twtxt.</p>
<p>If you want to start an indie microblog, my suggestion remains to use existing blog software that can generate simple RSS feeds. Short posts, no titles. This is a widely-deployed format that we can continue to work with for years to come.</p>
