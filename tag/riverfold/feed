				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Am I always starting over<br />
In a brand new story?<br />
Am I always back at one<br />
After all I&#8217;ve done?&#8221;<br />
— <a href="https://itun.es/us/5MKtZ?i=860769901">Always Starting Over</a>, from the broadway show If/Then</em></p>
<p>Daniel said on the <a href="http://coreint.org/192">latest Core Intuition</a> that it’s important to celebrate major work milestones, like shipping a new app or quitting a job. I didn’t think I’d be celebrating right away, but as it turned out, my wife met me for lunch on Friday and we had a beer to mark the occasion. She snapped this photo:</p>
<p><center><a href="https://instagram.com/p/5z8rowxMfV/"><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/whole_foods_lunch_beer.jpg" width="400" height="400" border="0" /></a></center></p>
<p>Some things just work out. I couldn’t have picked a better t-shirt to wear if I had planned it.</p>
<p>When 5pm came around I made a final comment on Confluence, replied to a couple emails, and then signed out of HipChat. But I didn&#8217;t have time for much reflection. My son and I were busy packing up to head to a campout with Boy Scouts. Then as soon as we arrived back the next day, I turned around again to take my daughter to see <a href="http://idinamenzel.com/">Idina Menzel</a>.</p>
<p>The concert was incredible, somehow including both Wicked&#8217;s &#8220;Defying Gratify&#8221; and Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;Creep&#8221; — and yes, of course Frozen — to make a show with both the occasional explicit lyric <em>and</em>  little kids pulled up from the audience to sing. It was only while driving home from the concert that I had a moment to think what I need to do next. Idina&#8217;s lines from If/Then at the beginning of this post kept coming back to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked a long time on a few things, and they were pretty good, but now it&#8217;s time to start over. I turn 40 in a few months. It&#8217;s time to figure out what the next 10 years of my life should be about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have some big news to share, so obviously I’m going to write a bunch of blog posts about it. This is the first one.</p>
<p>For a while now I’ve been juggling working on my own projects, with my indie company <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">Riverfold Software</a>, and having a regular job at the education e-book software company VitalSource, where I’ve been <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/02/13_years.html">for over 14 years</a>. As much as I felt like this balance mostly worked, lately it has become clear that the “nights and weekends” approach to Riverfold just isn’t going to be enough time going forward. Last week I resigned from my job at VitalSource to focus on growing Riverfold and shipping new apps this year, some of the most ambitious products I’ve ever tackled.</p>
<p>I thought it would be fun to do a series of blog posts about the early part of this transition. For the next couple weeks, as I wind down one set of projects and ramp up new ones, I’m going to post here with the slightly-catchy title prefix “Two weeks notice”. It will be me thinking out loud about the transition, kind of in the informal spirit of <a href="http://inessential.com/vespersyncdiary">Brent’s syncing diary</a>, or like a more serialized version of the <a href="http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/25.html">classic indie posts from Gus Mueller</a> and <a href="http://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2006/09/13/">Paul Kafasis</a>.</p>
<p>But unlike the authors of those posts, I can’t claim to have found success yet. If you take <a href="http://ideveloper.co/podcast081/">Scotty’s definition from the iDeveloper podcast</a>, in fact, I’m not “indie” at all; I expect some percentage of my time will have to be reserved for client projects to help pay the bills. While I used to find that idea distasteful — why give up a consistent salary if you’re not even going to call the shots? — I’ve come to realize that client work can be pretty interesting. The cycle of starting new projects and shipping them is a good way to learn new APIs and iterate on how to build an app from scratch.</p>
<p>While reading all these 2005-era indie blog posts, I was surprised to rediscover that <a href="https://www.red-sweater.com/blog/184/the-road-less-traveled">Daniel Jalkut also mentioned</a> mixing in consulting work:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Consulting makes an excellent back-up plan. You’ve always got a job if you need it, and your destiny is very much in your own hands.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course he wanted more than that: to build a great company based around his own apps. I&#8217;m sure Daniel and I will be talking about this on <a href="http://coreint.org">Core Intuition</a> later this week.</p>
<p>So it is a little in the vein of <a href="http://jonathanhays.me/2014/04/16/silverpine-software/">“leap and the net will appear”</a> that I’m moving on from a stable job, where I worked with great developers and friends, to something new that is a lot less certain. I thought that would make for a stressful week, but so far, everything seems okay.</p>
<p>There’s paperwork to do and code to write. There’s health insurance to figure out. But there are also some things that have already been wrapped up. My projects at work are in a good place, hopefully not needing constant maintenance. We just refinanced our house, so that’s a monthly savings, and something that I’m told is difficult without a “real” job.</p>
<p>Friday night I started catching up on some late business taxes (whoops). Saturday I finished editing <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/07/episode-190-they-become-lifelong-fans/">the podcast</a> (which we recorded over a week ago). The rest of the weekend I tried to relax with family (but I worked anyway). It’s Monday now and there’s a busy week ahead. Let’s see how this goes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/a-eulogy-for-twitter/361339/">The Atlantic has an interesting essay</a> on whether Twitter is on a slow decline, less useful and meaningful than it once was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Twitter is the platform that led us into the mobile Internet age. It broke our habit of visiting individual news homepages first thing in the morning, and established behaviors built around real-time news consumption and production. It normalized mobile publishing power. It changed our expectations about how we congregate around shared events. Twitter has done for social publishing what AOL did for email. But nobody has AOL accounts anymore.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It reminds me of something I brought up on Core Intuition a few months back, wondering if Twitter is a core part of the web, something that would be with us forever, or if it is “just another web site”. When we get into the groove of using a new service for a few years, it’s easy to forget that web sites don’t have a very good track record. Giant sites like Facebook and Tumblr seem to have been with us forever, but my personal blog is older than both.</p>
<p>Think about this: if it’s even <em>possible</em> for Twitter to fail — not likely, just possible — then why are we putting so much of our content there first, where there are <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms">rules for how tweet text can be used</a>? Storage for all tweets is so massive that there’s no guarantee that other companies will be able to take over the archive if the service has to fold. It’s why I built <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a> to archive and publish tweets.</p>
<p>Decentralization is the internet’s greatest strength and weakness. There shouldn’t be <a href="https://medium.com">one service</a> to hold all of blogging; each writer should have his or her own domain and web site. But web sites also die all the time from neglect. We need centralized services to index and syndicate content so that it’s <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">preserved</a> and accessible to more people.</p>
<p>Longevity is the next great challenge for the web. All of my work on Riverfold apps is leading this way, from archiving tweets, to <a href="http://sunlit.io/">curating and publishing your best photos</a>, to <a href="http://searchpath.io/">indexing a copy of the text and HTML from your blog</a>. But I’m just one guy with a limited server budget.</p>
<p>It’s time for a new web standard — a metadata format and API that describes how to mirror published content. Maybe it’s part of <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">IndieWebCamp</a>? When I write on my blog, I want the content to flow to GitHub Pages, to the Internet Archive, to Medium. When I post photos, I want the content to flow to Dropbox, to S3, to Flickr. It’s not enough to backup or copy data blindly; the source must point to each mirror, and each mirror service must understand who the creator is and how to find the original data if it still exists.</p>
<p>Unlike a distributed platform that works at the level of raw data, like BitTorrent, this new system should work natively with well-understood common files: text, photos, video, and the glue (usually HTML, Markdown, or JSON) that makes a collection meaningful. Instead of yet another generic sync system, it’s a platform that understands publishing, with adapters to flow content into each mirror’s native storage.</p>
<p>If you accept that this is something worth doing, then every place we put our content must be classified as either an original source or a mirror. And this brings us back to Twitter. Because while I think the next 5 years for Twitter will be strong, I’m not convinced that it will last 50 years. Therefore, Twitter cannot be an original source of data; it must be just one of several mirrors for micro-blogging.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While doing our taxes this month, I was a little surprised just how much I spend for various web apps and services to help run <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">Riverfold</a>. While I could trim some of them, most are essential and save a lot of time. I thought it would be interesting to write up some of the most important ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=f61c5d1648c72ebcf5bd8175aca79cfe5b374401"><strong>Linode</strong></a>: I’ve moved nearly everything to Linode. I like their style: just basic, solid hosting, with good features but not an overwhelming number of services or fancy stuff. They’ve recently increased their RAM and added SSD. I have servers there for Nginx/Unicorn, MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch. I also use their load balancer and Longview stats app. This link uses <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=f61c5d1648c72ebcf5bd8175aca79cfe5b374401">my referral code</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/"><strong>Amazon Web Services</strong></a>: I no longer use EC2, but I have some DNS hosted in Amazon’s Route 53. I also use S3 for backups and a new feature that’s coming to <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> soon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.heroku.com/"><strong>Heroku</strong></a>: Before moving to Linode, most of my stuff was on Heroku. Now I only have one small app and database there, and I’ll be completely moved off by the end of the year. I’m including it here for completeness only. It’s a great option to get started if you don’t want to be a part-time system administrator, but I think <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/03/27/web-hosting-for-app-developers">Marco sums up nicely why you want to use Linux servers</a> instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://stripe.com/"><strong>Stripe</strong></a>: Can’t say enough good things about Stripe. Watermark, Searchpath, Tweet Marker, and Core Intuition Jobs all use it for credit card processing. It’s the best.</p>
<p><a href="http://gaug.es/"><strong>Gauges</strong></a>: As much as I always loved <a href="http://haveamint.com">Mint</a>, as my business grew to several web apps and web sites, I looked for a new stats package that could support any number of sites, and which would work better across hosts, since I don’t need to run the database. I’ve been very happy with this.</p>
<p><a href="http://appfigures.com/"><strong>AppFigures</strong></a>: I’ve used this for years to track <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> sales. It’s great. I also like that I can enter other people’s popular apps and get an idea of how they’re trending if they make it to the top lists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blinksale.com/"><strong>Blinksale</strong></a>: Kind of an ancient invoicing app that hasn’t changed at all in years, but it works so I keep using it. Originally started by the folks who would go on to do Gowalla.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.beanstalkapp.com/"><strong>Beanstalk</strong></a>: I moved the source for all my Riverfold projects here because it can do Subversion and Git well. I sometimes wonder if I should move to GitHub instead, since I do use GitHub and have a couple tiny public repositories there, but I like that Beanstalk is focused only on private hosting. No social; just a well-designed web app.</p>
<p><a href="https://postmarkapp.com/"><strong>Postmark</strong></a>: Run by the same team as Beanstalk. I switched to this after Sendgrid had <a href="http://manton.org/2013/03/moving_off.html">some PR problems you may remember</a>. Email receipts and whatnot go through Postmark now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/"><strong>Dreamhost</strong></a>: Still using this for email and a few static or PHP sites. It’s cheap and works well. Not much benefit in moving away from it, though I prefer my more important web apps to be hosted on Linode.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnsimple.com/"><strong>DNSimple</strong></a>: I have a few domains here and hope to have all of them moved over eventually. I want to have a single place for DNS. Right now I have registration and DNS hosting spread across Dreamhost, Amazon, and Network Solutions. Makes it difficult to remember where everything is and to keep track of expirations.</p>
<p><a href="https://bufferapp.com/"><strong>Buffer</strong></a>: This company has been on my radar since someone asked me to support it in Tweet Library. They also have a really interesting blog where they share revenue, salaries, subscribers, web traffic, and other usually private details from a company. I admire that a lot. <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel</a> and I use it to automate sending Core Intuition Jobs links to Twitter, App.net, and Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/"><strong>Mapbox</strong></a>: We use Mapbox throughout Sunlit. I wrote more <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/01/sunlit_maps.html">about why here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/"><strong>FogBugz</strong></a>: In the past I’ve build my own bug tracker, used Jira, Redmine, GitHub issues, and others I’m forgetting. They all have problems so for Riverfold I keep it simple with hosted FogBugz. To complement this I use OmniFocus for non-bug tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/"><strong>Zendesk</strong></a>: For too long I was just using Apple’s Mail.app to handle support email. Now support email goes to Zendesk, where I can better track and reply to it. The downside is I’ve had a couple cases of people not seeing the replies, possibly because the HTML email is more often flagged as spam. Need to investigate whether I can switch it to plaintext, but otherwise I’m happy.</p>
<p><a href="http://keen.io/"><strong>Keen.io</strong></a>: I was inspired to try this after reading <a href="http://carpeaqua.com/2014/04/08/data-analytics-that-matter/">Justin’s post on analytics</a>. I’m experimenting with it to get better insight into how people are using my apps. So far so good.</p>
<p><a href="https://tapstream.com/"><strong>Tapstream</strong></a>: Just started using this to help track Twitter ads and other links, to see what marketing actually converts to App Store sales. The web app is good, they responded to a support question the same day, and I love that the SDK is just a handful of .m files that can be dropped into an iOS project.</p>
<p>And that’s it. I may have left a few things out (like consumer-focused apps Dropbox, App.net, and Twitter), but these certainly cover the major services I use now. In the old days it was common to just have one server that did everything. Now there are so many specialized services. While it seems like a lot to manage, each one does a much better job than I could do with a home-grown solution.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I started working on something new. It was going to be the first product after I refocused Riverfold around <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">a new mission statement</a>: apps to keep and remember what matters. It starts by solving a very basic problem, but the long-term scope is very big.</p>
<p>It’s for anyone with a web site or blog. It’s incredibly simple to set up. It’s a web app with a free trial that works like magic, requiring no registration.</p>
<p>Finally I’ve been able to dust off the project, give it a new name, and get it ready to ship. Launching tomorrow, February 14th.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is kind of a short, technical footnote to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">my last essay</a>. There I linked to an older blog post from Dave Winer, just one of many of his on this subject. Today <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/07/20/moreOnLocAndTwitter.html">he writes how we should archive blogs</a> before we worry about Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With Twitter there’s a rich corporation minding it. They can and imho should be funding their own archive. But with the historic blogosphere, dating back to the early-mid 90s, <em>a lot of it is already gone</em>. The need to preserve it, by independent historians and librarians, is greater than the need for Twitter to be publicly archived.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a lot to say on this, and I can&#8217;t wait to share a new web project that I started recently which could play a small roll in blog backups. When I killed off my little app Wii Transfer, I did so to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/05/saying_goodbye_to.html">refocus Riverfold around preservation</a>. I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It also doesn’t fit into a new theme I have for Riverfold: apps that are all about keeping and remembering what matters. For Clipstart, that’s family videos. For Tweet Library and Tweet Marker Plus, that’s old tweets.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Dave mentions libraries several times in his blog post. It’s no accident that the word “library” is in Tweet Library’s name; my ambition for this app far outpaces my coding speed. But blogs are a different problem, and they need something special — perhaps multiple solutions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just approved in the Mac App Store, Clipstart 1.4.2 fixes upload issues with YouTube and especially Vimeo, which was broken in previous releases because of Vimeo API changes. I expect this to be the final Mac App Store release for Clipstart. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html">As I blogged about before</a>, all Mac App Store customers can upgrade to the direct download version for free.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you should do if you bought Clipstart from the Mac App Store:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update to Clipstart 1.4.2 using the App Store app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run Clipstart at least once, then quit it. This allows it to copy the Mac App Store receipt so that it&#8217;s accessible to other versions of the app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the latest version from the <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">main Clipstart web site</a> and replace the existing copy in your Applications folder with the direct download.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And if you&#8217;re thinking about buying Clipstart for the first time, please get it directly from the web site and checkout via PayPal. There&#8217;s also a demo with support for 2 uploads and tagging 20 videos.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now turning my attention to version 1.5, which will improve a few things and add support for Gatekeeper on Mountain Lion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sort of odd &#8220;best of both worlds&#8221; balance in my different projects at &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ and as a solo shop is that I love working with a team, and I also love working alone. I mean really alone, doing the planning and design and coding and marketing. I&#8217;ve resisted farming out any piece of my apps at &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ (except the application icon) so that I can have complete control. It&#8217;s brutally hard sometimes, but it&#8217;s mine.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re working by yourself and add another person to the project, a funny thing happens: you become a manager. Before, you could spend 100% of your time on the work. Now you can allocate 50-75%, because you&#8217;re getting the new programmer up to speed, answering questions, and setting priorities. If you&#8217;re lucky (and I usually am), the person you added is contributing so much that it easily makes up for your loss in productivity, and then some.</p>
<p>The trade-off is worth it. Exchange the previous low communication overhead for extra coding man-hours.</p>
<p>You can build something great with a team, something that would be impossible alone, if you surround yourself with people who are better at your job than you are. I love that first moment when a team doubles in size from 1 to 2, or 2 to 4.</p>
<p>But after the initial frenzy of coding and emails and new features, I usually get burned out again. The project doesn&#8217;t strictly need me anymore, and I&#8217;m ready to get back to starting an app from scratch, when the scope is so small that the whole thing still fits in my head.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I &#8220;wrote in January&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2010/01/macworld_expo_2010.html, I decided to go to Macworld to show off Clipstart and Wii Transfer, and to experience the conference again and hang out with friends. I ended up doing less of the latter, because I lost my voice and was feeling terrible for a couple days, but nevertheless the trip was great and I&#8217;m very glad I went. Worth it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my summary of the show, what it took for me to be there and what I got out of it for &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/. This is supposed to be in the spirit of &#8220;Rogue Amoeba&#8217;s excellent series on Macworld&#8221;:http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/2007/01/16/should-i-exhibit-at-macworld-part-1-costs/, but more from a super-tiny company perspective, and just where my experience differs.</p>
<p>I do want to quickly mention costs, since that&#8217;s the primary consideration when planning these things. I took advantage of the Indie Developer Spotlight shared kiosk to keep investment low. In fact, I wouldn&#8217;t have gone otherwise. I kept the whole trip to about $2700, with a rough breakdown like:</p>
<p>$1250 &#8211; space on the show floor</p>
<p>$900 &#8211; hotel for 4 nights</p>
<p>$250 &#8211; flights to and from San Francisco</p>
<p>$100 &#8211; printed &#8220;2000 flyers&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/4326331440/</p>
<p>$200 &#8211; other misc costs, cabs, and food</p>
<p>I could have saved some money in there on the hotel, but in general I think I did pretty well. For a lot indies it&#8217;s probably not that much different than a WWDC trip.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/manton/4425406126/in/set-72157623476367967/"><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2010/flyers_ollie.png" alt="flyers_ollie.png" title="flyers_ollie.png" border="0" width="200" height="138" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="5" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /></a> I worked 8 hours each day on my feet at Moscone North, in my little booth space in the very corner of the expo. I was lucky for two things: Guy English was awesome and covered for me a couple times so I could take a real break; and the restrooms and water fountain were so close I could slip away when traffic was slow and be back without missing much.</p>
<p>The less expensive booth option was supposed to be for a table shared between 3 developers, with presumably a dozen or more small companies filling the area. But unlike the iPhone pavilion in the center of the tradeshow, which was packed with exhibitors, hardly any Mac developers took advantage of this offer. It was just me and one other company.</p>
<p>This was disappointing at first, since a less dense area doesn&#8217;t convey the same excitement and means less foot traffic. But there were other aspects of the deal that turned out better than expected, such as included wired internet even though none was originally promised. Compared to a traditional booth, it was a bargain.</p>
<p>Before leaving Austin for San Francisco I jotted down a few notes on how I could measure success, since I didn&#8217;t want to pin whether it was worth it just to direct sales.</p>
<p><em>See friends and meet new people.</em> Check, but there were a lot of people that I ran into very briefly and didn&#8217;t get to really talk to. See aforementioned lost voice.</p>
<p><em>Get ideas from customers.</em> Check, got plenty of great ideas. I loved talking to random Mac people, not limited to just the ones who bother to send email.</p>
<p><em>Figure out how to sell the product.</em> There&#8217;s nothing like explaining your application over and over again all day to refine your pitch. I feel like I have a much better handle on this, but there&#8217;s still work to do, and web sites to update.</p>
<p><em>Actually sell some copies.</em> I used a coupon code to track sales. During the conference my sales were flat, but in the weeks since I&#8217;ve had the best sales days of Clipstart ever.</p>
<p><em>Get exposure in the press.</em> Check, was interviewed by Ryan Ritchey for &#8220;The Digital Lifestyle&#8221;:http://thedigitallifestyle.tv/home/2010/2/12/wii-transfer-at-macworld-2010.html, Merlin Mann for &#8220;MacBreak Video&#8221;:http://www.pixelcorps.tv/macbreak301, and talked with other members of the press on the show floor. I should have done more but lacked the energy.</p>
<p><em>Win best of show award.</em> Nope, but wasn&#8217;t expecting it. I think it&#8217;s a shame that only one Mac application won, but on the flip side it&#8217;s great that it was &#8220;Inklet&#8221;:http://tenonedesign.com/inklet.php. Really cool app.</p>
<p>Everyone&#8217;s expectations coming into the event were low &mdash; the previous exhibitors who backed out, the attendees who wrote Macworld off, and the press who questioned the show&#8217;s relevance. But clearly Macworld 2010 was a success. The second day of the expo I was late to the show floor, arriving just a few minutes before they opened the hall. There was a huge mass of people waiting to get in.</p>
<p>There will be a Macworld 2011. I&#8217;m really excited to see how it works to move the whole expo and conference to Moscone West. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ll be there yet, since as demonstrated this year I can&#8217;t plan nearly that far in advance. Throwing all of this together 2 weeks before the show only worked because of everyone who made things a little easier during the week.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jason Snell, Merlin Mann, Adam Lisagor, and everyone else who stopped by and waited patiently through my demos; also Guy English, Paul Kafasis, David Barnard, John Fox, John Chaffee, the RogueSheep guys, my booth buddies from &#8220;Hello Chair&#8221;:http://hellochair.com/appsaurus/, and the other indie developers I&#8217;m forgetting; and especially Albert McMurry, Dan Moren, and John Gruber for telling people about Clipstart. It succeeds only because of word of mouth.</p>
<p>In closing&#8230; Maybe it&#8217;s because James Cameron is still in the news, but I&#8217;ve always loved this line from the character Rose in Titanic: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make any sense. That&#8217;s why I trust it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s mostly how I felt about exhibiting at Macworld. Even though it was &#8220;cheap&#8221; by tradeshow standards, for me it was real money and a risk. I booked my flight the day I realized that the only reason not to go was because I could fail.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I haven&#8217;t been to a Macworld since the late 90s. I&#8217;ve had it in my head for a couple years that I&#8217;d like to go back, but with so many developer-focused conferences it&#8217;s been hard to justify an extra trip for Macworld. At the same time, my &#8220;indie apps&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ need a nice marketing refresh. So why not exhibit at Macworld and get to see the show again while reaching a new audience of potential customers?</p>
<p>I knew I&#8217;d regret it this year if I didn&#8217;t take advantage of the &#8220;small indie pavilion kiosk&#8221;:http://macworldexpo.com/indiespotlight. So with frighteningly little planning so far, I&#8217;ve booked the expo, flights, and hotel. I&#8217;ll be at the show and I&#8217;ll be demoing the just-released Wii Transfer 2.7 and the unannounced Clipstart 1.3. The rest of the details&#8230; not so clear.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m pretty excited about the conference and hope to see many of you there. The expo runs February 11th &#8211; 13th, and you can &#8220;get a free expo pass here&#8221;:http://rcsreg.com/macworld/AMU29713.</p>
