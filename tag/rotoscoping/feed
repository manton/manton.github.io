				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comic-Con San Diego has started. For a humorous look at the kinds of people you might see walking the show floor, check out the excellent series of &#8220;recent sketches on the Story Boredom blog&#8221;:http://storyboredom.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_storyboredom_archive.html. I&#8217;ve never been to the convention, but have some friends who go most every year. Some of those people also worked on &#8220;A Scanner Darkly&#8221;:http://www.scannerdarklymovie.com/, which opened last weekend in wider release, banking an impressive $5000 per theater with a #9 opening at the box office. I saw the film last weekend and enjoyed it, especially the last half which seemed less burdened by unnecessary Linklater-ish dialog. In general I&#8217;m not a big rotoscoping fan, but the style held my attention and was well-executed.</p>
<p>In other animation news, the National Film Board of Canada has &#8220;put many of their classic films online&#8221;:http://www.nfb.ca/animation/objanim/en/films/ (via &#8220;Peter Merholz&#8221;:http://www.peterme.com/archives/000758.html). Also see &#8220;this beautiful little film&#8221;:http://www.skyvu.net/film/tree_qt_lg.htm by CalArts student &#8220;Ian Worrel&#8221;:http://ianworrel.blogspot.com/. Despite what the big studios do, I love that traditional animation is thriving at schools and with independent animators.</p>
