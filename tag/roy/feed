				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walt&#8217;s nephew &#8220;Roy Disney died this week&#8221;:http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/12/16/roy.disney.obit/index.html. In 2003 I blogged about &#8220;Roy leaving the company&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2003/12/roy_leaves.html. I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame that Roy is the one to leave. It&#8217;s clear that Disney (the company) has lost its way, and Eisner has no vision for what the company could be.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Luckily for us, since that time a lot has changed, and the animation division does have leadership in John Lasseter. One of the most visible changes just opened in theaters last weekend: The Princess and the Frog. I&#8217;ve seen every theatrical release out of Disney feature animation since I could afford the few bucks to go to a theater, so I wasn&#8217;t likely to miss this return of 2d animation.</p>
<p>My daughters and I really loved this movie, not just because of my love for hand-drawn animation, but for a story that works and characters that are rooted in something real &mdash; singing Cajun fireflies and voodoo magic aside, of course. There are some really touching scenes here. &#8220;Sandro Cleuzo says&#8221;:http://inspectorcleuzo.blogspot.com/2009/12/milt-kahl-day-12.html the animation was rushed, but I think they did a heck of a job.</p>
<p>The credits are almost as if nothing has changed &mdash; Eric Goldberg, Andreas Deja, Mark Henn, Nik Ranieri. &#8220;The reality is slightly different&#8221;:http://www.dreamonsillydreamer.com/, but there&#8217;s a mix of new animators among the familiar names. A lot is riding on the success of this film, and it managed a respectable $25 million over the weekend.</p>
<p>Great job, Disney. I&#8217;m glad Roy got to see the beginning of the next 2d comeback.</p>
