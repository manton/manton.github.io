				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I read a lot of weblogs. RSS is a great way to keep up with sites that update infrequently, or that aren&#8217;t popular enough to bubble up on Twitter with dozens of retweets. But the Mac and iOS community has grown so much over the years. I know there are many new writers who haven&#8217;t been on my radar yet.</p>
<p>Brent Simmons has posted <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/11/16/blogs_by_women">a great list of tech blogs by women</a> that I&#8217;m going through now. There should be something there for anyone interested in development or design:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I made a list of some blogs I already knew about, and then I asked my friends for more, and they totally came through.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The list grew to include over 50 blogs as suggestions arrived to Brent via Twitter. I&#8217;ve already subscribed to a bunch and look forward to discovering even more.</p>
<p>One of my favorite new blogs is the travel blog complement to <a href="http://natashatherobot.com/">Natasha The Robot</a>, which made Brent&#8217;s list. Natasha was recently <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3973-natasha-the-robot-murashev-joins-basecamp">hired at Basecamp</a>, runs the <a href="https://swiftnews.curated.co/">This Week in Swift</a> newsletter, and <a href="http://www.natashathenomad.com/">writes on her new blog</a> about working remotely. From a post about taking her laptop to restaurants in Europe:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The nice thing about this is that I get a really cool and inspiring office for a few hours &#8211; each cafe or restaurant has it&#8217;s own vibe, people, music and I don&#8217;t feel rushed internally knowing that I need to go back to my apartment or coworking space to actually work.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>When I quit my day job this year, it was partly so we could travel more without worrying too much about my work schedule, outside of when the kids are in school. In fact, just days after I finished writing my <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/2weeks">two weeks notice</a> blog posts, we went to Europe and started a private family blog about the trip. So I&#8217;ve been inspired by Natasha&#8217;s blog as she shares her experience working in different cities.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s a theme you&#8217;ll find in many of the developer-oriented blogs on Brent&#8217;s list. Wanting to get better, learning something new, and then sharing it with everyone else. Take this advice from Becky Hansmeyer, who wrote a daily series of posts about what she learned building her iPhone app, one post each day while she waited for her app to be approved by Apple. <a href="http://beckyhansmeyer.com/2015/06/05/waiting-for-review-day-4-visual-style/">From day 4</a>, on design and color:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I think the biggest thing I learned in choosing colors and fonts for my app is not to get too hung up in making comparisons to other apps. I spent a lot of time looking at my favorite apps like Overcast and Tweetbot and thinking about the decisions the developers made, and as a result I wound up feeling like I had to make those same decisions. But that was stupid because my app is my own and is also designed for a much smaller market.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Or this quote from Kristina Thai, who wrote <a href="http://www.kristinathai.com/how-to-be-a-speaker-if-you-dont-have-any-experience/">a post about preparing to give a talk</a> for the first time:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;My presentation didn’t flow, it was jagged and very rough around the edges, but I kept at it, made some changes and it got better. And better. And even better. And then I practiced it in front of a couple of friends who gave me even more feedback until I was ready.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Kristina also gave a talk called <a href="http://www.kristinathai.com/writing/">Become a Better Engineer Through Writing</a>. You can get a sense of the talk by downloading the slides. It covers the value to programmers in keeping a private journal, why you might write tutorials for your site, and makes a strong case for blogging.</p>
<p>Blogging isn&#8217;t difficult, but it&#8217;s still not yet as easy as tweeting. By creating a blog, you&#8217;re making a statement that you <em>care</em> about something. As I go through <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/11/16/blogs_by_women">Brent&#8217;s list of bloggers</a>, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m looking for: what does the author care about, and what can I learn from or be inspired by in their writing? Because the more diverse our RSS subscriptions are — the more varied the opinions in what we read and share with others — the closer it gets us to a strong, healthy community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jussi Pekonen has <a href="http://pekonen.cc/blog/2015/11/09/Relaunching-old-launching-new-and-reactivating-a-dormant-account.html">relaunched his weblog</a>, with a new focus on microblogging:</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>He calls the short posts &#8220;blips&#8221;. I call mine <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">snippets</a>, which I borrowed from <a href="http://noahread.net/snippets">Noah Read</a>. I like both names, but even more importantly, I like Jussi&#8217;s approach to owning his own content and providing a simple RSS feed of microblog posts. (I wrote more about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">RSS and microblogs</a> a couple weeks ago.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RSS is solid. It&#8217;s lasted a long time with very few changes, and forms the foundation for subscribing to weblogs and delivering podcasts. It&#8217;s huge and the open web is a much better place because RSS exists.</p>
<p>But even if RSS doesn&#8217;t need to change, some types of apps would be better off if we took a fresh look at the elements in an RSS feed. What is really needed, and when faced with multiple &#8220;correct&#8221; options, which should we choose? As more writers embrace microblogging, it&#8217;s an opportunity to simplify our feeds and tools.</p>
<p>This is my proposal for a bit of housekeeping around microblogging. It&#8217;s not a new format. It&#8217;s just a guide for producing the best RSS. I&#8217;d divided this proposal into 5 sections below.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum viable elements</strong></p>
<p>Look at the average RSS feed and there&#8217;s a lot of junk in it that most RSS readers ignore. While there&#8217;s nothing wrong with including extra XML elements, we should strive for a feed that is simple enough to be easily read. The fewer redundant and unused elements, the more consistently that different RSS readers will interpret it.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of an RSS feed whittled down to its essential elements. Most feeds should look like this by default, and only add additional elements from the RSS spec or RSS extensions when it&#8217;s absolutely required (such as the enclosure element for podcasting).</p>
<pre><code>&lt;rss version="2.0"&gt;
    &lt;channel&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Manton's weblog.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;link&gt;http://www.manton.org/&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;description&gt;&lt;![CDATA[
                &lt;p&gt;Hello world.&lt;/p&gt;
            ]]&lt;/description&gt;
            &lt;pubDate&gt;Fri, 04 Sep 2015 15:32:32 +0000&lt;/pubDate&gt;
            &lt;guid isPermalink="true"&gt;http://www.manton.org/2015/09/3007.html&lt;/guid&gt;
            &lt;link&gt;http://www.manton.org/2015/09/3007.html&lt;/link&gt;
            &lt;author&gt;@manton&lt;/author&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            ...
        &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Title is optional</strong></p>
<p>The existing RSS spec says that title is optional. In fact, in the early days of blogging, tools such as Radio Userland and Blogger didn&#8217;t even have titles. We got away from that with the popularity of Movable Type and WordPress, even though some modern apps like Tumblr still look at a title as unnecessary for certain post types.</p>
<p>With microblogging, the title will frequently be empty or missing. Do tweets have titles? No, and neither should short microblog posts published through a traditional blog platform. Skipping the title removes some friction in the writing process, making it easier to write a quick post and send it out.</p>
<p>RSS readers must be prepared for a title-less RSS item. Instead of inserting &#8220;Untitled&#8221; as the placeholder title, think about how your reading UI can accommodate microblog posts gracefully. Blank titles (where the title exists but is an empty string) are equivalent to a completely missing title element.</p>
<p><strong>HTML post text</strong></p>
<p>The description XML element in RSS wasn&#8217;t originally intended to support HTML. It was often a text summary or opening paragraph of an article, rather than full text. With microblogging, you always want the full text inside the RSS feed, including any styled text or inline HTML links.</p>
<p>Some feeds will include the plain text version of a post in the description element, and the HTML version in a content:encoded element, as specified by <a href="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">this RSS namespace extension</a>. This should be avoided in favor of a single description element with the full HTML, using CDATA syntax to avoid escaping characters.</p>
<p>In modern apps, rendering simple HTML is common. If an RSS reader can&#8217;t show HTML, it should strip out the HTML tags itself. It&#8217;s not up to the feed to provide multiple versions. If both description and content:encoded are present in a feed while parsing, for compatibility it&#8217;s acceptable to prefer whichever includes HTML.</p>
<p><strong>JSON</strong></p>
<p>I said this isn&#8217;t a new format, but we should have the option of expressing RSS in JSON instead of XML format. Back in 2012, <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2012/09/10/rssInJsonForReal.html">Dave Winer wrote about</a> producing a JSON-based RSS feed, with a very literal mapping of elements. If our goal is to cleanup some of the edge cases of RSS, though, we can further simplify it. I&#8217;d suggest collapsing a few of the elements, so that it isn&#8217;t overly nested like XML, and to JSON-ify the item elements into a simple items array:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "channel": {
        "title": "Manton Reece",
        "description": "Manton's weblog."
        "link": "http://www.manton.org/"
    },
    "items": [
        {
            "title": "",
            "description": "&lt;p&gt;Hello world.&lt;/p&gt;",
            "pubDate": "Fri, 04 Sep 2015 15:32:32 +0000",
            "guid": "http://www.manton.org/2015/09/3007.html",
            "link": "http://www.manton.org/2015/09/3007.html",
            "author": "@manton"
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>This preserves the element names and overall feel of RSS, while being cleaner and more JSON-like. Note that it&#8217;s easy to embed HTML directly in the JSON description field. Because there&#8217;s no room for an isPermalink attribute, if the guid is a URL, it is always the permalink.</p>
<p><strong>Authors</strong></p>
<p>A feed for a microblog platform, or a group weblog, might include multiple items each from different authors. The RSS spec says that the XML &#8220;author&#8221; element is an email address, but that is very rarely used in real feeds.</p>
<p>Instead, the author element value should vary slightly from the original specification to include either a simple full name, or a username prefixed with the @-sign: <code>&lt;author&gt;Manton Reece&lt;/author&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;author&gt;@manton&lt;/author&gt;</code>.</p>
<p><em>What do you think? I&#8217;d love to hear any feedback <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">via email</a>. If you write on your own blog about this, send me the link.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://medium.com/the-story/taking-medium-to-the-next-level-cb7f223fad86">Ev Williams announced</a> a batch of new Medium features recently:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;There’s always another level. Another level of polish and power in our product. Another level of breadth to our content. Another level of dialogue and discussion. And another level of progress. Today, we are announcing a slew of updates to bring Medium to the next level and in the process make it more powerful, more fun, more democratic, and more essential.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Those updates include new mobile apps, @-mention support, a publishing API, and editor improvements. There&#8217;s also a new logo. (I know they put a lot of thought into this, and it&#8217;s a strong idea, but to me the logo&#8217;s design is so clever it&#8217;s actually kind of distracting. A little more subtlety in how they&#8217;re using depth could improve future iterations.)</p>
<p><a href="https://red-sweater.com/blog/3079/mediums-new-api">Daniel Jalkut blogs about</a> what&#8217;s included (and what&#8217;s left out) in Medium&#8217;s new API:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;One of the most unique aspects to Medium’s API is the provision for specifying a <em>canonical URL</em> and <em>license</em> on a post being submitted to the service. The canonical URL refers to another web location that should be considered <em>the original</em>, or most authoritative version of a post, while the license designates whether the post’s copyright terms stipulate a post is sharable as public domain or under a particular Creative Commons license. These attributes together indicate that Medium expects and encourages users of the API to contribute content that is not intended to be exclusive to Medium.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>While <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/evan-williams-on-indie-web-sites.html">I generally think</a> the trend to centralized writing platforms is bad for the web, I&#8217;m happy to see these changes from Medium, especially the API and expanding custom domain support. Medium has grown very slowly and carefully. I expect we&#8217;ll see quicker iteration on these new features now that they&#8217;re officially out.</p>
<p>In the process of experimenting with Medium posting, <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/13/gettingInSyncWithMedium.html">Dave Winer shared his take on post title support</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;It seems they have arrived at what I think is the correct answer: posts can have titles or not, and the content system has to be prepared for either case. That&#8217;s where this blog was <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/10/07/iNeedABetterBloggingSystem.html">in 1999</a>, before other blogging tools and Google Reader pushed the world toward requiring titles. And then Twitter came along not having titles at all, and the intersection between all the kinds of blog-consuming environments became almost empty.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m very interested in this because <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">microblogging shouldn&#8217;t include titles</a>. While Medium is mostly traditional essays, clearly comments don&#8217;t need titles, and Medium&#8217;s quick-posting UI encourages short posts. I hope this approach will get more RSS readers to gracefully handle title-less posts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1999, I started a link weblog to collect news about animated films. I updated it for a few years, until there were plenty of other good news sources from industry writers more qualified than I was to run such a site. I was just a fan.</p>
<p>The site was a homegrown MySQL database and set of PHP scripts. Somewhere along the way, I lost the archive, and never noticed that the site had broken until today. To make matters more difficult, I had blocked it in my robots.txt, so the Internet Archive copy (which existed, at least in parts) wouldn&#8217;t load cleanly.</p>
<p>I took some time today to piece it back together as a new static HTML file and (partial) RSS feed. I&#8217;ve preserved the original design and HTML tags. Fun rediscoveries in the HTML include spacer GIFs, &lt;blockquote&gt; to indent the entire page, and RSS 0.91.</p>
<p>I called it <a href="http://www.manton.org/lightbox/">The Lightbox</a>. It was just a linkblog. But now 16 years later, I&#8217;ve enjoyed skimming through the old posts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;m catching up on some news, two posts today about Twitter caught me eye. First, very big news via Federico Viticci, that full tweet search <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/full-archive-search-api">is available even to third-party apps</a>. Twitter&#8217;s limited search was the main reason I originally built <a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">Tweet Library</a>. It&#8217;s fantastic that this data is now more easily available.</p>
<p>But it was this opening paragraph from <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2970341/web-social/twitter-on-the-mac-do-your-job-or-get-out-of-the-way.html">Jason Snell&#8217;s article on Macworld</a> about Twitter neglecting the Mac version that got me thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Three years ago this month Twitter <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1168183/twitter_hands_down_new_strict_rules_for_third_party_developers.html">broke its covenant with the third-party developers</a> who helped fuel its initial growth and create some of its most innovative features. The message was clear: Twitter was in charge of its own platform, and while other Twitter apps would be tolerated, it would only be in limited fashion and for a limited time.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was around this time, nearly 3 years ago, that I posted my last tweet. My bet with <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel</a> is over whether I will return to Twitter within 5 years. People ask if I&#8217;ll come back sooner, and if I did, what it would take. I&#8217;ve often struggled to articulate those conditions, because I think we are seeing <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/ev-on-twitter-third-party-devs.html">slow but consistent progress</a> to unwind the developer-hostile decisions made a few years ago. It may be that in a couple years the environment will be much improved, but there won&#8217;t be any single decision that &#8220;fixed&#8221; it, or it may be that Twitter is doomed to have changing leadership and there will never be any guarantees.</p>
<p>There is one thing, though. There is one change that was made while rolling out the version 1.1 Twitter API: they removed support for unauthenticated RSS feeds of user tweets or timelines. If they reversed that one decision, the next day I would be back on Twitter.</p>
<p>I can pick out a single feature like this, among every other improvement that third-party developers would love to see, because the combination of removing RSS and at the same time locking down the API — those changes together best represent the move away from the open web. Any other incremental improvement short of unauthenticated RSS, no matter how welcome, isn&#8217;t enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When App.net was first taking off, many microbloggers struggled with how to decide where to post their short-form writing. Should they post some topics to Twitter and others to App.net? Should they cross-post everything to both services? At the time, there was an informal consensus that cross-posting was a cheat. It couldn’t take advantage of each platform’s strengths, and followers might often see the same post twice.</p>
<p>I now believe that cross-posting is a good thing. Photos, as one example, are frequently cross-posted to both Instagram and Facebook. Tweets can be sent to Twitter <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/more-quick-blogging-workflows.html">as well as our own blogs</a>. Many apps like Instagram or Foursquare support and even encourage cross-posting. It’s good for developers because it helps spread knowledge of the publishing app, and it’s good for writers because it means there are multiple copies of our content.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/sneak-peek-screenshot.html">It’s no secret</a> that I’m building a microblog aggregation and publishing service. The goal is for us to get back to our roots with blogging — to write on our own web sites first, not as an afterthought to Twitter. Cross-posting is an important bootstrap for that.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a blog, <em>start one today</em>. It takes minutes to set up, and hardly any more time to wire up automatic tweeting <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">via IFTTT from your RSS feed</a>. Start with cross-posting and see if something interesting evolves from there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/more-quick-blogging-workflows.html">I said</a> that one important facet to microblogging is the timeline experience. This is a basic foundation to Twitter’s success, although they continue to de-emphasize or twist it. Their upcoming Project Lightning will attempt to curate and deliver tweets to you that are important regardless of who you’re following. <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mathonan/twitters-top-secret-project-lightning-revealed">From Mat Honan’s scoop</a> on the project for Buzz Feed:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Launch one of these events and you’ll see a visually driven, curated collection of tweets. A team of editors, working under Katie Jacobs Stanton, who runs Twitter’s global media operations, will select what it thinks are the best and most relevant tweets and package them into a collection.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/06/twitter-project-lightning-timeline/">David Pierce wrote for Wired</a> with further speculation on what it could mean for Twitter. David starts with the premise that Twitter is basically full of junk:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Sure, yes, everyone’s Twitter is different—that’s one of the service’s best aspects, that you can follow anyone you want and see whatever you want. Unfortunately, this only works if everyone on Twitter isn’t terrible most of the time. They are.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The essay continues, describing Project Lightning as the death of the Twitter timeline as we know it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With this change, Twitter doesn’t have to look like an endlessly flowing, context-free stream of tweets; instead, you can see a hand-curated set of tweets, links, images, and videos related to what’s happening right now. You see one at a time, swiping through them until you get to the end. And there’s an end!”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Since I haven’t seen this new feature, I can’t tell whether it’s a major shift in how Twitter is used. <a href="http://www.macstories.net/linked/twitters-project-lightning/">Federico Viticci is optimistic</a> about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “This is another example of Twitter moving beyond Legacy Twitter and the belief that Twitter is still only a timeline of tweets in chronological order. The company has been enhancing the service with media improvements and design changes aimed at making Twitter less static – the opposite of a traditional timeline. If anything, they&#8217;ve been moving <em>too slowly</em> in this area.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Federico on the value of curation and surfacing great content. But also the timeline must remain at the heart of Twitter, just as a reverse-chronological list of posts has been on every blog home page since the term weblog was coined 18 years ago.</p>
<p>Dave Winer calls these timelines “rivers”, and last week <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/06/19/riverbrowserOpenSourceRelease.html">he open-sourced a browser</a> for the River.js timeline files. Formatted as JSONP, you can think of River.js as conceptually the same as an RSS feed, except that it’s easy to display with HTML using only JavaScript.</p>
<p>I plan to fully support outputting River.js in the project I’m working on. For the last few years, Twitter has had a monopoly on the timeline. We need to break that up. The first step is <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">encouraging microblogs everywhere</a>, and the next step is to build tools that embrace the timeline experience. If you’d like to see my take on this, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the project announce list</a>.</p>
