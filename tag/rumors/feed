				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zac Hall of 9to5Mac follows up with a new leaked photo after the <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/iphone-5se.html">latest iPhone 5se news</a>. It seems the hardware design may borrow more from the 6 than the 5. <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2016/01/24/4-inch-iphone-5se-photo/">Zac writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “If the leaked image turns out to both be the real deal and what Apple ships later this year, that means the updated 4-inch iPhone will feature rounded volume toggles and a relocated sleep switch like on iPhone 6 hardware versus a top sleep switch and iPhone 4-like volume buttons from the iPhone 5 series hardware.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>NoooOOOooooo. I can understand wanting consistency between models, but the iPhone 6 sleep button is a major usability issue because it gets in the way when trying to use the volume buttons. I’ll be disappointed if the design trade-offs from the 6 make the 5se worse. (But I’ll buy one anyway.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve talked about my hope for a new 4-inch iPhone several times on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, and a few times on this weblog, like <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/4-inch-iphone-rumors.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/matt-bonner-and-the-iphone-6.html">here</a>. The rumors keep growing, and <a href="http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2016/1/thoughts-on-an-iphone-6c">Stephen Hackett has written out his thoughts</a> on a potential iPhone 6C:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The easy assumption is that the 6C would replace the aging 5S as the free-or-very-cheap option, but the recurring rumor of the 6C being powered by the A9 makes me think this may slide in roughly where the iPhone 6/6 Plus currently sits in the lineup.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see an A9, but I&#8217;m not counting on it. I think an A8 is fine too, mostly matching the internals of the latest iPod Touch. This wouldn&#8217;t be competitive with the iPhone 6S but it would still be a great upgrade from the iPhone 5S, which is the primary phone for anyone (like me) who still clings to the 4-inch design.</p>
<p>The larger 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch designs will remain the top of the line iPhones for years to come. The 6C doesn&#8217;t need to change that; it&#8217;s not a peer to the larger phones. It just needs to clean up all the money Apple&#8217;s left on the table from customers who want a smaller phone. I&#8217;ll buy one right away.</p>
