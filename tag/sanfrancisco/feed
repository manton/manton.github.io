				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pretty hilarious <a href="https://medium.com/@padlet/an-honest-guide-to-the-san-francisco-startup-life-6df13d23689">guide to San Francisco startup life</a> from Padlet on Medium. Here&#8217;s just one small part:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Markets are chockablock with these desk+gym hybrids — standing desks, treadmill desks, cycling desks. This is why I feel bullish about my swimming desk idea — a big water tank with an infinity pool and a computer bolted on one side. Noise cancelling scuba masks, snorkels, and fins come as standard equipment.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been fascinated with Medium lately, and have cross-posted a couple recent posts <a href="http://medium.com/@manton">over there</a> to better understand it. Is it a blogging tool? Sort of. Is it a social network? Not exactly.</p>
<p>While you can follow other users there, I find that even with the 100+ people I&#8217;m following, the posts I see on Medium are almost exclusively popular essays written by people I don&#8217;t know. They&#8217;re recommended enough that they show up in Medium&#8217;s daily emails, or on the home page, or linked from other blogs I read. But it&#8217;s like if you signed in to Twitter and only saw retweets.</p>
<p>This may explain Medium&#8217;s design changes to encourage quick, microblog-like posts, in addition to full essays. Longer blog posts just aren&#8217;t written often enough to make for a meaningful social network.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“This is it,” a friend said to me as we were walking up Market Street with other developers, late at night as WWDC was winding down several years ago. The iPhone had hit. The conference was getting bigger. Apple was on the verge of becoming a giant in the industry and you could feel it in the air — a coming change that was obvious only from a distance because it disappeared as you reached for it, like San Francisco fog rolling over the bay. “This is the height of the conference and it’s never going to be like this again.”</p>
<p>Looking back it perfectly captured what I think of as the second “era” of WWDC. It was a kind of golden age for Mac and iOS developers, with a new generation of successful Mac indies and before the iOS race to the bottom was much past the starting line.</p>
<p>From my perspective, learning Mac development in the mid 90s, there are three distinct eras of Apple’s WWDC. My first WWDCs were at the San Jose Convention Center. The developer base was small enough that you consistently ran into everyone, companies like Metrowerks and even Adobe seemed to have an influence on the conference, and Apple frequently showed off new APIs that might not actually ship soon or ever. It was an exciting time to be a Mac developer but the rest of the world didn’t care. This was the backdrop for the failed Copland project, for Steve Jobs coming back, for the clash between Carbon and Cocoa, and the acceptance of Mac OS X.</p>
<p>The next era was at the move to San Francisco. The conference was getting bigger but Apple attempted to keep the events and themes that made WWDC the same, even for a while busing attendees to the beer bash in Cupertino. This is the time when the iPhone SDK arrived and the conference exploded. I think most developers will always look back at this time as something amazing. It’s the backdrop for that walk up Market Street and a dozen similar conversations.</p>
<p>Now we’re in the third modern era of WWDC, with one undeniable characteristic: a small percentage of developers can get a ticket to the conference. The community, however, is as strong as ever, and there’s still a desire to have WWDC be that “one place” that developers can meet each year. It’s a need that smaller, regional conferences, no matter how important they are, just can’t fill.</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://jamesdempsey.net/2014/04/18/life-without-wwdc/">this post from James Dempsey</a> because it starts with the assumption that <em>not</em> getting a WWDC ticket is the new normal:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Once something changes from being dependably available to rarely available, you begin to form alternate plans and take alternate paths.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s right. Since it’s likely that Apple will continue to iterate slowly instead of making major changes to grow the conference, we’re better off adapting. By adapting we can focus on preserving the community aspects of WWDC that are arguably just as important as the technical tracks.</p>
<p>And change comes slowly to WWDC. I realized while watching (https://developer.apple.com/tech-talks/videos/) recently that Apple just doesn’t see a big problem. John Geleynse described a situation where only one person from a team is at WWDC; the rest of the company is back at the office watching videos and sending questions to their coworker at the conference to ask in the labs. Getting videos out the same day makes the conference more useful for both those without a ticket and actual attendees (and their team) too.</p>
<p>(I still have complaints about how WWDC tickets are distributed and why Apple doesn’t attempt to grow the conference a little more, but the lottery is an improvement over last year. See Core Intuition <a href="http://coreint.org/132">episodes 132</a> and <a href="http://coreint.org/133">133</a> for a full discussion.)</p>
<p>I’ll be in San Francisco for a few days next week — at <a href="http://www.altconf.com/">AltConf</a>, at the <a href="http://guestlistapp.com/events/250698">Cartoon Art Museum fundraiser</a>, catching up on session videos, <a href="http://bb.zaarly.com">waiting in line</a> for coffee, hiding in my hotel room writing code, and getting some good food and drink with fellow developers. WWDC means something different now, but it matters just as much as it always has. Hope to see you there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WWDC 2006 was great. (Yes, it was two weeks ago. Finally making time to blog again.)</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t dwell on the announcements too much, but I generally agree with some that there was nothing earth-shattering. We have only seen a part of what Leopard will become (an improved Finder and some unification of window and control types seem inevitable). The most exciting stuff is new APIs for developers, not flashy end-user features.</p>
<p>I had a great time hanging out, catching up with people and meeting new folks too. Buzz Anderson&#8217;s &#8220;Monday night party&#8221;:http://weblog.scifihifi.com/2006/07/23/party-time-excellent/ was excellent.</p>
<p>In addition to the new Leopard goodness (hello Core Animation and Interface Builder), I also came back with new excitement for a side project that I have been working on: an email client. I had stopped active development until hearing what Apple had planned for Mail.app in Leopard, but now I can safely say that they are going in a completely different direction than what I want to focus on.</p>
<p>Threads like &#8220;this one on Hawk Wings&#8221;:http://www.hawkwings.net/2006/08/21/can-mailapp-cope-with-heavy-loads/ (via &#8220;Steven&#8221;:http://stevenf.com/mt/2006/08/big_mail.php) also confirm that there are a number of users out there who want the same kind of things I want in an email client. Of course it has to be fast and scale, but I think I have a few twists on the old formula as well.</p>
<p>In San Francisco we also stayed an extra day and visited the Oakland museum, drove up to Point Reyes, and saw a great musical Friday night: &#8220;Putnam County Spelling Bee&#8221;:http://www.spellingbeethemusical.com/. I recorded a bunch of audio for an upcoming podcast, although not as much as I probably should have. There were a few times in particular I wish I had taken my microphone out.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s Sunday before day 1 of WWDC 2006. &#8220;Willie&#8221;:http://www.angrylearner.com/ and I took a walk this afternoon, down Market Street to the bay, following the water around to Pier 39, then up Lombard and meandering through quiet San Francisco back streets until we come through the middle of Chinatown and back to the hotel. Along the way I recorded some pieces of audio, hoping I could use them for a podcast I&#8217;m preparing about the city. Willie snapped pictures, almost all of which came out looking really good. I like &#8220;this one of me&#8221;:http://www.flickr.com/photos/willie/208562868/in/set-72157594226958432/ trying to get the sound from underneath the cable car track.</p>
<p>I accidentally left the MiniDisc recorder going for a part of our trek, wasting a bunch of disc time. The UI is so bad on these devices that I don&#8217;t know how to cut out just part of a track, so I went off searching for a new disc. Over lunch Daniel Steinberg had showed me his &#8220;M-Audio&#8221;:http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/MicroTrack2496-main.html, which I had considered earlier and now pretty much regret not purchasing. Maybe I&#8217;ll eBay the MiniDisc recorder at some point.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning is the keynote.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1997 I walked into Half Priced Books to browse and left with a copy of &#8220;Eadweard Muybridge and the Photographic Panorama of San Francisco, 1850-1880&#8221;:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&amp;path=ASIN/0262581213&amp;tag=mantonorg&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325 for $5. I had been familiar with Muybridge through his series of photographs of humans and animals in motion, which have been a classic reference for animators for nearly a century.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m coming back to his San Francisco photos as I prepare a podcast about that city. I am very excited about this one, and hope to have it finished soon after I return from WWDC. The &#8220;video games podcast&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2006/07/video_games_podcast.html was a lot of fun, but it had some problems that I hope to correct this time around.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tweaked this weblog design again, adding one of Muybridge&#8217;s panoramas to the header and experimenting with some different fonts and colors. I&#8217;ll switch the image out from time to time.</p>
