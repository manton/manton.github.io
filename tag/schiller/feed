				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I liked today&#8217;s Macworld keynote. In many ways it was a return to pre-iPhone keynotes, with a few good announcements but nothing crazy earth-shatteringly amazing how-can-we-ever-top-this-again. Solid upgrade to iLife. Good news on iTunes. Impressive battery life on the refreshed 17-inch MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>At first I was worried that new versions of iPhoto and iMovie would obsolete my new app before its 1.0 even ships, but I think I&#8217;ve narrowly escaped the knife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ryan at 37signals had this to say&#8221;:http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1507-iphoto-09-and-domain-language about iPhoto &#8217;09:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now iPhoto &#8217;09 has kicked their language up a notch further. In addition to Events there are also Faces and Places. Apple has made a few new slices into the photo organization cake, and they&#8217;ve opened up a new field of possibilities for people to find and enjoy their photos.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The new iPhoto does look amazing, but I&#8217;m not convinced that adding these new concepts improves the usability of the app significantly. Even in iPhoto &#8217;08, it&#8217;s not often clear when to use an Event vs. an Album. Tagging in Flickr and other popular web apps has proven that a fast, generic one-size-fits-all approach to categorizing can not only work, but is more flexible and requires less mental overhead to churn through images, movies, or what have you.</p>
