				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally read <a href="http://www.imore.com/tracing-se-name-through-history">Stephen Hackett&#8217;s article over at iMore</a> about using &#8220;SE&#8221; in Apple product names. He lists the Macintosh SE, iMac DV SE, iBook SE, and others. Most are forgettable, but the SE/30 feels the most like today&#8217;s iPhone SE: better internals in an old package.</p>
<p>Stephen also pointed to a <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1138328/macat25_bestmac.html">Macworld article with quotes about the SE/30</a> and other Macs. John Siracusa had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Though future models with the original upright shape were released, they were all tagged with the derisive moniker Classic. The SE/30 bore no such shame. It was and is the undisputed king of the original, iconic Macs and, therefore, of all Macs for all time.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The very first computer I ever owned was the Mac Classic. It was the cheapest Mac at the time, but still very expensive for us. I insisted that we get it despite the cheaper PCs that were more powerful and in color.</p>
<p>What struck me when I later saw my friend&#8217;s SE/30 was that the Classic was actually slower and worse in a couple of ways than the SE/30, even though the Classic came out almost two years later. Still, I loved that little machine. Everything good that has happened in my life since can be traced back 25 years ago to when I brought it home.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of hyperbole in the tech industry about creating products that make the world a better place. But most products just don&#8217;t have that big of an impact. To me, the Macintosh was an incredible, wildly divergent fork in the road — a choice leading to new friends and a new career, meeting my wife and starting a family. It’s hard to even imagine where the original path was leading.</p>
