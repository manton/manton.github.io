				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of a renewed commitment this year to work on my web app <a href="http://searchpath.io/">Searchpath</a>, I’ve just rolled out a few improvements. A search engine like Searchpath needs frequent maintenance to keep running smoothly — minor bug fixes and behind-the-scenes work on queues and web crawling — but I also hope to catch up on new features that I’ve long planned for the product.</p>
<p>One marketing bullet I always had that wasn’t fully realized: “Also serves as a text backup for your site.” Searchpath now exposes links to download both the HTML for any stored page on your site as well as a text-only version of that page after Searchpath has attempted to trim out the navigation and other links. Hopefully this will help out any customers who might need to retrieve lost text from their site if their primary site backup failed (or doesn’t exist).</p>
<p>Searchpath is free to try and $8/month or $75/year. Setup is as simple as copy/pasting one line of JavaScript where you want a search box. You can <a href="http://searchpath.io/">learn more and get started here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have big news for Searchpath today. The client-side portion of Searchpath is now officially open source and <a href="https://github.com/manton/searchpath">available on GitHub</a>. While I do think one of the innovations of Searchpath is the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, it’s really the simplicity of setting up Searchpath that makes it work. A single line of JavaScript adds a search box and indexes your site, and the crawling and storage will of course remain private on my servers.</p>
<p>Now that part of the service is on GitHub, customers who wanted to extend the JavaScript can have a clear path for doing that. Not only is it easier to host the JavaScript yourself, but I’m accepting pull requests to integrate your improvements back into the core product for everyone to use. Special thanks to <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a> for already submitting some tweaks.</p>
<p>I’m also very excited to announce a simple themes structure for Searchpath. Because in addition to the JavaScript, the second part of customizing Searchpath is the design. While I document CSS class names you can use to override styles, I wanted to make it even easier to design completely new user interfaces and share them with others.</p>
<p>On GitHub you’ll find a “themes” folder. Any sub-folder here will be routinely synced to the main Seachpath server, where you can access it by adding “theme=folder_name” to the JavaScript include URL. To create your own theme, just add a sub-folder with your own custom theme name and submit a pull request. When the theme is added to Searchpath, all your CSS and images will be hosted by my servers. (The first person to use a specific name will effectively become the owner of it, and I’ll only accept pull requests from that person.)</p>
<p>Want to learn more about Searchpath? You can <a href="http://searchpath.io/">try it out here</a> for free, or sign up for $8/month.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/overview/">RapidWeaver</a> is a popular web site building app from Realmac Software. It’s got a great Mac UI, a bunch of nice themes, and a strong community of developers and plug-ins. One of those plug-ins is Stacks, which is so useful that it has <em>its own</em> set of <a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/addons/rapidweaver/stacks">third-party components</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://joeworkman.net/blog/post-46971234489">Joe Workman has released a stack</a> that makes adding and customizing Searchpath on your RapidWeaver site easy:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “A nice custom site search is difficult to implement. Most website simply piggyback on search engines such as Google or DuckDuckGo. However, <a href="http://searchpath.io/">Searchpath.io</a> came on to the scene earlier this year and I think its pretty cool. It’s a freemium search service that lets you implement fast and simple search directly onto your website.”

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://sivers.org/hi">Here’s a great post from Derek Sivers</a> on <em>not</em> automating everything. Instead, sometimes it’s better to just hire a real person to do some extra work:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It’s fun for techies to try to find the tech solution to everything, but don’t forget that even a tiny touch from a real person can be the best algorithm, and a massive business maximizer.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I hit a brick wall related to this with <a href="http://searchpath.io/">Searchpath</a>. I launched a little early, and hadn’t yet finished the invoicing system so that customers automatically got an email receipt for each charge. Then life and other work got in the way, and weeks later I still hadn’t shipped it. I wanted it to be completely perfect and automated, so that I never had to think about it.</p>
<p>But I did think about it. I thought about what would happen if I sent a receipt with the wrong dollar amount, or the wrong product name, or the wrong wording so that customers got confused enough to cancel their subscription.</p>
<p>So I built half a system first. I’m manually clicking a button to send out receipts, and in the process reviewing them to make sure that customers are being invoiced correctly. It won’t scale much longer — in fact, many receipts were already sent late — but for now it gets the ball moving forward again, and brings some confidence to finish the missing pieces.</p>
