				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m not going to comment specifically on the substance of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/">the SendGrid and PlayHaven mess</a> because it’s complicated and completely out of hand already. It’s a pretty sad situation for everyone.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, I am a SendGrid customer. I use the free plan to send email in a few of my web apps. I started using SendGrid because they offered it as a simple Heroku add-on, not because of any particular research or opinion about what they were doing well.</p>
<p>So it’s a good time to move away, to a company that I can pick based on merits and attitude and not just because it was the default choice. I’ve long been a <a href="http://www.beanstalkapp.com/">Beanstalk</a> customer; I use it for all my private Subversion and Git repositories. The makers of Beanstalk, Wildbit, have a second product similar to SendGrid that looks like what I need: <a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://wildbit.com/blog/2013/03/22/a-gentlemans-agreement/">Wildbit also had a good blog post</a> yesterday from some of the aftermath of the controversy as it relates to SendGrid (and Postmark) competitors:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “We’ve been doing this a long time, 13 years as a company, 8 years since launching our first product. There’s this rule, this gentleman’s agreement I thought existed. When someone you compete against is suffering, especially as a result of any kind of infrastructure issues, shut up and keep your head down. You do not use this situation to gain a few customers eager to jump ship.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I like what I see in Postmark. I’ve set up an account and should have my apps switched over to Postmark this weekend.</p>
