				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While doing our taxes this month, I was a little surprised just how much I spend for various web apps and services to help run <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">Riverfold</a>. While I could trim some of them, most are essential and save a lot of time. I thought it would be interesting to write up some of the most important ones.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=f61c5d1648c72ebcf5bd8175aca79cfe5b374401"><strong>Linode</strong></a>: I’ve moved nearly everything to Linode. I like their style: just basic, solid hosting, with good features but not an overwhelming number of services or fancy stuff. They’ve recently increased their RAM and added SSD. I have servers there for Nginx/Unicorn, MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch. I also use their load balancer and Longview stats app. This link uses <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=f61c5d1648c72ebcf5bd8175aca79cfe5b374401">my referral code</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/"><strong>Amazon Web Services</strong></a>: I no longer use EC2, but I have some DNS hosted in Amazon’s Route 53. I also use S3 for backups and a new feature that’s coming to <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> soon.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.heroku.com/"><strong>Heroku</strong></a>: Before moving to Linode, most of my stuff was on Heroku. Now I only have one small app and database there, and I’ll be completely moved off by the end of the year. I’m including it here for completeness only. It’s a great option to get started if you don’t want to be a part-time system administrator, but I think <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/03/27/web-hosting-for-app-developers">Marco sums up nicely why you want to use Linux servers</a> instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://stripe.com/"><strong>Stripe</strong></a>: Can’t say enough good things about Stripe. Watermark, Searchpath, Tweet Marker, and Core Intuition Jobs all use it for credit card processing. It’s the best.</p>
<p><a href="http://gaug.es/"><strong>Gauges</strong></a>: As much as I always loved <a href="http://haveamint.com">Mint</a>, as my business grew to several web apps and web sites, I looked for a new stats package that could support any number of sites, and which would work better across hosts, since I don’t need to run the database. I’ve been very happy with this.</p>
<p><a href="http://appfigures.com/"><strong>AppFigures</strong></a>: I’ve used this for years to track <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> sales. It’s great. I also like that I can enter other people’s popular apps and get an idea of how they’re trending if they make it to the top lists.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blinksale.com/"><strong>Blinksale</strong></a>: Kind of an ancient invoicing app that hasn’t changed at all in years, but it works so I keep using it. Originally started by the folks who would go on to do Gowalla.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.beanstalkapp.com/"><strong>Beanstalk</strong></a>: I moved the source for all my Riverfold projects here because it can do Subversion and Git well. I sometimes wonder if I should move to GitHub instead, since I do use GitHub and have a couple tiny public repositories there, but I like that Beanstalk is focused only on private hosting. No social; just a well-designed web app.</p>
<p><a href="https://postmarkapp.com/"><strong>Postmark</strong></a>: Run by the same team as Beanstalk. I switched to this after Sendgrid had <a href="http://manton.org/2013/03/moving_off.html">some PR problems you may remember</a>. Email receipts and whatnot go through Postmark now.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/"><strong>Dreamhost</strong></a>: Still using this for email and a few static or PHP sites. It’s cheap and works well. Not much benefit in moving away from it, though I prefer my more important web apps to be hosted on Linode.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnsimple.com/"><strong>DNSimple</strong></a>: I have a few domains here and hope to have all of them moved over eventually. I want to have a single place for DNS. Right now I have registration and DNS hosting spread across Dreamhost, Amazon, and Network Solutions. Makes it difficult to remember where everything is and to keep track of expirations.</p>
<p><a href="https://bufferapp.com/"><strong>Buffer</strong></a>: This company has been on my radar since someone asked me to support it in Tweet Library. They also have a really interesting blog where they share revenue, salaries, subscribers, web traffic, and other usually private details from a company. I admire that a lot. <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel</a> and I use it to automate sending Core Intuition Jobs links to Twitter, App.net, and Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/"><strong>Mapbox</strong></a>: We use Mapbox throughout Sunlit. I wrote more <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/01/sunlit_maps.html">about why here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fogcreek.com/fogbugz/"><strong>FogBugz</strong></a>: In the past I’ve build my own bug tracker, used Jira, Redmine, GitHub issues, and others I’m forgetting. They all have problems so for Riverfold I keep it simple with hosted FogBugz. To complement this I use OmniFocus for non-bug tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/"><strong>Zendesk</strong></a>: For too long I was just using Apple’s Mail.app to handle support email. Now support email goes to Zendesk, where I can better track and reply to it. The downside is I’ve had a couple cases of people not seeing the replies, possibly because the HTML email is more often flagged as spam. Need to investigate whether I can switch it to plaintext, but otherwise I’m happy.</p>
<p><a href="http://keen.io/"><strong>Keen.io</strong></a>: I was inspired to try this after reading <a href="http://carpeaqua.com/2014/04/08/data-analytics-that-matter/">Justin’s post on analytics</a>. I’m experimenting with it to get better insight into how people are using my apps. So far so good.</p>
<p><a href="https://tapstream.com/"><strong>Tapstream</strong></a>: Just started using this to help track Twitter ads and other links, to see what marketing actually converts to App Store sales. The web app is good, they responded to a support question the same day, and I love that the SDK is just a handful of .m files that can be dropped into an iOS project.</p>
<p>And that’s it. I may have left a few things out (like consumer-focused apps Dropbox, App.net, and Twitter), but these certainly cover the major services I use now. In the old days it was common to just have one server that did everything. Now there are so many specialized services. While it seems like a lot to manage, each one does a much better job than I could do with a home-grown solution.</p>
