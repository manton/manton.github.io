				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like &#8220;Seth Godin&#8221;:http://sethgodin.typepad.com/. I haven&#8217;t read all his books, but I really enjoyed &#8220;The Dip&#8221;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591841666?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mantonorg&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591841666 and &#8220;Tribes&#8221;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591842336?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mantonorg&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591842336. They were quick reads (I got the first on audio, the other in print). He seemed to crack the problem of getting a business book down to its core idea and not using any more pages than needed.</p>
<p>So it surprised me when I picked up his latest, &#8220;Linchpin&#8221;:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591843162?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mantonorg&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591843162, and months later I&#8217;m still not even halfway through. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the content; I like what I&#8217;ve read so far. But it doesn&#8217;t flow the same way his other writing does, and at twice as long it doesn&#8217;t have the same structure.</p>
<p>Finally I realized I was doing it wrong. The best way to approach Linchpin is non-sequentially. Now I just jump to any random page, read a few profiles for the people and companies he uses as examples, and then 5 minutes later put it down again. I get just as much out of the book, but without the guilt of staring at the remainder of unfinished pages.</p>
