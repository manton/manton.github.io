				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a &#8220;Wil Shipley post&#8221;:http://wilshipley.com/blog/2008/07/pimp-my-code-part-15-greatest-bug-of.html a few months ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Software is written by humans. Humans get tired. Humans become discouraged. They aren&#8217;t perfect beings. As developers, we want to pretend this isn&#8217;t so, that our software springs from our head whole and immaculate like the goddess Athena. Customers don&#8217;t want to hear us admit that we fail.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The measure of a man cannot be whether he ever makes mistakes, because he will make mistakes. It&#8217;s what he does in response to his mistakes. The same is true of companies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about mistakes and bugs as I beta test &#8220;Sifter&#8221;:http://www.sifterapp.com/. Since it&#8217;s not ready for launch yet I won&#8217;t comment on it specifically, except to say that despite many bug systems becoming very mature (in some cases, too mature) every developer still has a different set of needs. There will always be a new bug system promising to fix all your problems, and for many of us we have to keep reminding ourselves not to code our own. Been there done that.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There will be many C4 wrap-up blog posts, but &#8220;Fraser Speirs hit the spirit of the conference&#8221;:http://speirs.org/2008/09/08/c42-brain-dump/ very well:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I thought C4 was incredibly reflective. If you imagine it as a smaller WWDC, it&#8217;s really nothing like that. The amount of code shown on-screen is really quite small, and the conversation is really about the art, craft, business, science and lifestyle of Mac development.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I had a great time at C4. As always I met a bunch of new folks and caught up with everyone I hadn&#8217;t seen since WWDC or the previous C4. It was especially wonderful to hear the positive feedback about &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ in person. Thanks!</p>
<p>I also participated from the stage, as Wolf called me up to be on Saturday night&#8217;s panel literally minutes before it started. I have a feeling I came off as a bit of an oddball &mdash; I managed to shrug off software pirates, decry moving away from Subversion, suggest a &#8220;crap&#8221; label for the App Store, and actually recommend Dreamhost &mdash; but I hope there was value in it for attendees, even if it was less exciting than last year&#8217;s panel. Wil Shipley did a great job guiding questions for the panel.</p>
