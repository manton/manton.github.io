				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 90s I bought a LaserDisc player because it was the best way to get bonus features like director’s commentary and “making of” shorts on some of my favorite movies, before DVDs took off. But I’ve resisted getting a Blu-ray player, even though studios seem to have completely shut out DVDs from the behind-the-scenes material we’re used to. Luckily artists can still share their work directly via the web.</p>
<p>I love this new site from Pixar artists, just in time for the holidays, on <a href="http://www.theblueumbrellamakingofholidaycalendar.com/">the making of their short film The Blue Umbrella</a>. It’s presented as a holiday calendar with a new page revealed each day. From day 3:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The second test I had made after having just been to a concert of Sarah Jaffe. I fell in love with her music and voice and desperately wanted to pitch her an idea for a music video. But I needed a concept for it. While walking through the city and listing to her songs I suddenly got this idea for a music video where a whole city would sing one of her songs.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s one of those rare sites that is so wonderful that I make an exception to not following it if there’s no RSS feed. Added to my bookmarks.</p>
