				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No, I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;Dave Winer&#8217;s thoughts&#8221;:http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews on RSS reader design exactly, although that&#8217;s part of it. It&#8217;s more the way we in the technology community interact with the world. Hundreds of news feeds, company chat, external IRC channels, private AIM, email dinging every 5 minutes, and the constant flow of tweets. At home, we&#8217;re connected essentially 24/7; on the road, the iPhone brings it all with us. Plus there&#8217;s the never-ending pile of work to do on too many projects.</p>
<p>Technology news or politics or development moves too fast and doesn&#8217;t slow down. It&#8217;s easy to feel like you&#8217;re being pulled down the river, one hand struggling to hold on to the raft and the other deep in the current, information overload all around.</p>
<p>Since coming back from C4 I&#8217;d been fighting a cold, which developed into a cough and sinus infection and fever and whatever worse. I finally hit the doctor up last week and just unplugged, checking email twice a day for emergencies only. I spent the rest of the day sleeping, reading, and with family &mdash; a self-imposed vacation for my brain as much as my body.</p>
<p>Four days later I&#8217;m feeling quite a bit better, and trying to think about what changes to make in my schedule so as to not wind up insane or dead before I&#8217;m 35. But even as I say that I acknowledge that it&#8217;s stretching the truth, because I&#8217;ve never been happier.</p>
