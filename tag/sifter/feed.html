I worried about preventing fraud even though the only instance we ever encountered only cost us $200. I constantly worried that Sifter could go down at any moment [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Great post from Garrett Dimon&#8221;:http://garrettdimon.com/post/6724266888/my-biggest-mistake, on his biggest mistake building the bug-tracker Sifter:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I got bogged down watching our bottom-line even though we&#8217;ve always been comfortably profitable. I worried about preventing fraud even though the only instance we ever encountered only cost us $200. I constantly worried that Sifter could go down at any moment even though we&#8217;ve had 99.96% uptime since launch. [&#8230;] All of these little things were distracting me from the work that really mattered.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For a small company, focusing on the wrong things will make or break a product. I&#8217;m guilty of the same thing. I sat on &#8220;Tweetmarks&#8221;:http://tweetmarks.net/ for 6 months without launching it because I was worried about how to pay for hosting and how to get developers involved.</p>
<p>Sometimes there&#8217;s no obvious solution <em>until you ship</em>. Eventually it becomes easier to know when to be patient &mdash; to solve a problem right the first time &mdash; and when it&#8217;s needless worrying over something that may or may not even happen. And as 37signals says: &#8220;decisions are temporary&#8221;:http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch06_Done.php anyway.</p>

Humans get tired. Humans become discouraged. They aren&#8217;t perfect beings.

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Software is written by humans. Humans get tired. Humans become discouraged. They aren&#8217;t perfect beings. As developers, we want to pretend this isn&#8217;t so, that our software springs from our head whole and immaculate like the goddess Athena. Customers don&#8217;t want to hear us admit that we fail.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The measure of a man cannot be whether he ever makes mistakes, because he will make mistakes. It&#8217;s what he does in response to his mistakes. The same is true of companies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about mistakes and bugs as I beta test &#8220;Sifter&#8221;:http://www.sifterapp.com/. Since it&#8217;s not ready for launch yet I won&#8217;t comment on it specifically, except to say that despite many bug systems becoming very mature (in some cases, too mature) every developer still has a different set of needs. There will always be a new bug system promising to fix all your problems, and for many of us we have to keep reminding ourselves not to code our own. Been there done that.</p>
