				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we start 2009, I continue to be inspired by what independent artists and developers are able to create with limited resources. Here&#8217;s one example.</p>
<p>Roger Ebert recently &#8220;posted a thoughtful review&#8221;:http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2008/12/having_wonderful_time_wish_you.html of animator Nina Paley&#8217;s independent feature Sita Sings the Blues. Paley is still in a small bit of copyright trouble with the songs and is trying to &#8220;creatively find a way out&#8221;:http://blog.ninapaley.com/2008/12/28/sitas-distribution-plan/. The copyright problem was news to me. I subscribe to Paley&#8217;s blog but haven&#8217;t been keeping up with it lately.</p>
<p>Early in 2008 I invited Paley to screen her films at &#8220;STAPLE!&#8221;:http://www.staple-austin.org/, but she was busy finishing Sita and preparing for its premiere in Europe. She has some great older shorts too, including one of the first Flash to QuickTime animated shorts I remember seeing, Fetch, which was linked years ago off Hotwired&#8217;s defunct animation site.</p>
<p>(Speaking of STAPLE!, &#8220;Stan Sakai&#8221;:http://www.staple-austin.org/guests/ will be our guest in March. If you are in the Austin area, please stop by.)</p>
<p>Sita Sings the Blues will find an audience eventually. I gave some money as Paley was soliciting donations to finish the feature, and I know I&#8217;m not the only one inspired by what she&#8217;s created. Making an indie feature film is an amazing accomplishment.</p>
