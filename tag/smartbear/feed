				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Great post by Jason Cohen&#8221;:http://blog.asmartbear.com/blog/put-down-the-compiler-until-you-learn-why-theyre-not-buying.html on why you need feedback about the real reason people aren&#8217;t buying your product:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You need to talk with the people who were interested enough to find your website, read your marketing copy, download your product, and then _give up without even an email_. That&#8217;s the low-hanging fruit; those are the people who are _in your grasp_, who should be buying _today_, but aren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I fall into this trap quite often, of pretending I know what the product needs for sales to finally take off. So I&#8217;ll add all the features I hope customers want, or I&#8217;ll make a small change and see if sales improve. But the truth is that there are so many variables in this system that it&#8217;s difficult to know which change made the difference.</p>
<p>As an example, I decided recently that I was being too generous with the demo limits in &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/, so in the 1.2.1 release I turned them down a little. Instead of letting you tag 30 videos and upload 3 for free, it&#8217;s down to 20 videos and 2 uploads. The idea is to just do a little bit more to encourage users to buy the software when they are first trying it out and like it, rather than waiting a month until they decide to use it again.</p>
<p>Sales have been up the last week, so this worked, right? Maybe not. Clipstart has a review in this month&#8217;s print edition of Macworld, so it&#8217;s possible the sales are up because of that. Or because a couple of my blog posts have been linked more heavily recently. Or for any number of other reasons.</p>
<p>Unless you measure why the product doesn&#8217;t sell, success will be based on luck and intuition, which only go so far. I&#8217;m looking forward to reading Jason&#8217;s next post.</p>
