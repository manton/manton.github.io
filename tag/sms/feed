				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">writing about my WordPress-based microblog</a> and linking to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/more-quick-blogging-workflows.html">similar solutions from Seth Clifford and Ben Brooks</a>, I’ve been hearing from more bloggers about their interesting microblog workflows. Everyone has a slightly different spin on the basic idea, but all of them achieve some independence from Twitter by having the primary copy of each post live on their own site.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://alpha.app.net/chasemccoy/post/61446625">Chase McCoy mentions on App.net</a> that he uses Launch Center Pro for quick microblogging of links:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “To make a post all I have to do is copy a link, and then run a Launch Center Pro action that prompts me for the text of the post. One click and it&#8217;s done!”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, <a href="http://vandragt.com/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress-and-twitter">Sander van Dragt describes</a> his WordPress setup. It’s similar to mine, but his post includes more detail. He also links to a comment on <a href="https://gist.github.com/manton/f8b6f8b391a2f3d9b419#comment-1480486">my .htaccess gist</a> with a better explanation and rewrite rules.</p>
<p>Next up, <a href="http://adamsimpson.net/writing/microblogging">Adam Simpson shares</a> how he posts to his own microblog directly from an SMS. He even goes one step further, integrating tweet features directly back into WordPress:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I save the tweet ID of every post that gets posted to Twitter. I use that ID to pull in the favorite and retweet counts and display them next to each ‘note’ in the WordPress dashboard.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, here’s <a href="https://alpha.app.net/mrhenko/post/61441031#61435778">an AppleScript solution on App.net from Henrik Carlsson</a> that allows him to take any text on his Mac and quickly post it to his microblog via an Automator workflow. Pretty great. I had forgotten that AppleScript has native XML-RPC support, which most blogging systems support.</p>
<p>I’m inspired by all the cool work people are doing around blogs. It’s a good time to write on the web.</p>
