			<p>I published 2 new <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable</a> episodes this week, with a shared theme around Kickstarter projects. They&#8217;re both just 5-6 minutes long.</p>
<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/04/episode-19-kickstarter-recording/">Episode 19</a> is about how I finally sat down to record a video for my upcoming Kickstarter project. I still have editing to do, but I&#8217;m already feeling a lot better about actually launching this.</p>
<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/04/episode-20-kickstarter-rewards/">Episode 20</a> continues the discussion of Kickstarter, starting with my reaction after receiving the art book from <a href="http://blog.loish.net/">Loish</a> yesterday. I was really impressed with how well it was produced. Anytime I see something of such high quality I&#8217;m inspired to do a better job with my own work.</p>

			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In my posts about <a href="../2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">defining what makes a microblog post</a> and <a href="../2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">guidelines for RSS</a>, I talked a little about links but didn&#8217;t explore linkblogging. While many blog authors post primarily long essays, shorter link blogs are a common approach for bloggers who want to post new content several times a day.</p>
<p>Essentially two types of link blogs have evolved since the early days of blogging. The most traditional link blog can be seen in <a href="http://scripting.com/#linksTab">Dave Winer&#8217;s posts</a> (click on the Links tab). These are links with a very short commentary. Many tweets are like this. In a way, this format is the purest form of microblogging.</p>
<p>The second type of link blog starts to fall outside the limits of microblogging. Instead of just including a URL, authors use a quote from the linked material as the foundation for the post. The majority of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> posts adopt this format. While John Gruber is known for his full essays, those longer posts are infrequent today. He keeps his site active by linking to other interesting essays and tacking on his own brief opinion.</p>
<p>Daring Fireball has become so successful that Gruber&#8217;s approach to linkblogging has been copied by many other sites. <a href="http://macstories.net/">MacStories</a>, <a href="http://sixcolors.com/">Six Colors</a>, <a href="http://onefoottsunami.com/">One Foot Tsunami</a>, <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/">John Moltz&#8217;s Very Nice Web Site</a>, and <a href="http://marco.org/">Marco Arment&#8217;s blog</a> are just a handful that follow this pattern. All of these sites post the occasional essay, but most blog posts link away to an external site in the RSS item, not back to their own site.</p>
<p>At a technical level, this difference can best be seen in the RSS feed&#8217;s &lt;link&gt; and &lt;guid&gt; elements. These elements will contain URLs that either link back to the main site, or link away to an external site.</p>
<p>Here is where this evolving approach to link blogs starts to break down. Let&#8217;s take an example from Six Colors, one of my favorite sites. (I recommend <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">subscribing</a>. The members-only secret podcast with Jason and Dan Moren is really fun, and the email magazine is great too.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://sixcolors.com/link/2015/09/hulu-unlocks-the-albatross/">link post about Hulu&#8217;s pricing</a>, Jason Snell actually writes <em>4 paragraphs</em> of commentary (plus a footnote). This is more like an essay than a short link post that points to the external site.</p>
<p>Another example is when <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/twitter-launches-moments/">MacStories linked to Twitter&#8217;s launch of Moments</a>. A few paragraphs of quoted text, <em>5 paragraphs</em> of MacStories commentary. The commentary is as important or even more important to read than whatever Federico is linking to.</p>
<p>Sometimes we read sites like MacStories, Six Colors, or Daring Fireball more for the commentary than for what is being linked to. But when using an RSS reader, there is too much confusion about where an item&#8217;s link goes when clicked if the site&#8217;s feed isn&#8217;t consistent about linking everything back to its own site.</p>
<p>And in fact Jason Snell acknowledges this problem by offering two separate RSS feeds: the default one, with a mix of links back to Six Colors for essays and pointed elsewhere for link posts; and another feed with everything linking back to Six Colors, where the commentary lives. He also attempts to minimize confusion on his own site by giving each type of post its own icon in the site design.</p>
<p>The less clear-cut the distinction between essays and link posts, the more confusion we introduce to readers. In some ways, this mixed approach really <em>only</em> works for Daring Fireball, because his feature essays are so long, and so obviously different in format to the rest of the link posts.</p>
<p>Good conventions for blogging have been at a standstill for years. While part of the appeal of indie blogging is there&#8217;s no one &#8220;right&#8221; way to do it, and authors can have a strong voice and design that isn&#8217;t controlled by a platform vendor, we must accept that Twitter has taken off because it has a great user experience compared to blogs. It’s effortless to tweet and the timeline is consistent. For blogging to improve and thrive, it should have just as straightforward a user experience as social networks wherever possible.</p>
<p>Luckily, RSS already has everything we need for clients to visually distinguish between link posts and regular ones. If the &lt;link&gt; element points to a domain other than the one for the site, it’s probably a link post. If the &lt;link&gt; and site domain match, it’s a full post.</p>
<p>I’ve adopted this in my new microblogging platform by exposing the domain in the UI itself, at the end of the title or microblog post whenever it’s a link post. If it’s a full post, the link isn’t added. And for either type of post, the timestamp links back to whatever was in the &lt;link&gt;.</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot from one of Dave’s posts. Note that the link was <em>not</em> in the RSS text. It was added by my app automatically:</p>
<p><center><img src="../images/2016/snippets_linkblog.png" width="550" height="105" alt="linkblog example" border="0" /></center></p>
<p>This has been a long post, but it boils down to two simple recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re a blog author and you’re adding any significant commentary, the RSS feed should point back to your site.</li>
<li>If you’re an RSS client developer, the difference between link posts and full posts should be exposed in the UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that adopting these will bring more consistency to blogging. Users won’t need to hover over links, or guess what will happen on a click or tap. It’s a small change that will make reading blogs a little better.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>On the latest <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/16">Under the Radar podcast</a>, Marco Arment and David Smith talk about ways to make your app more robust. That includes tips for scaling your app with a lot of data, and also dealing with potentially hostile user data. It’s that last point that I’ve been thinking the most about lately.</p>
<p>With the experience of building Tumblr and Instapaper, Marco is clearly now hesitant to ship app features that accept arbitrary user-generated content, because a small indie company just doesn’t have the resources to deal with spam and abuse. Instead, he suggests outsourcing whenever possible. For example, letting Apple accept and reject podcasts, and basing the Overcast podcast directory search on that already-vetted list.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re building a Twitter-like service. As we all know, hate is widespread on Twitter. At times, it seems impossible to even have a G-rated Twitter experience. But the problem is less that users can publish terrible tweets, and more that it is so easy to be <em>exposed to those tweets</em> with search, trending topics, retweets, and replies.</p>
<p>As I work on my microblogging project, I’m trying to be aware of these points in the platform where bad content can leak out. So I don’t have global search or trending topics. I also don’t make it easy to stumble upon random users. But I do have replies, which by default will currently go out as push notifications if you have the iPhone app installed. It’s that area that I should focus my attention.</p>
<p>Two options that come to mind for minimizing abuse in replies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t allow replies from people you aren’t following. This solves the problem, but it comes at the expense of discussion. It removes the accessibility that many people love about Twitter’s asynchronous following model.</li>
<li>Quarantine or attempt to classify replies so they don’t bubble up in your timeline or as notifications by default. This would be like an over-aggressive email spam filter. Difficult to get right and possibly routed around by clever microbloggers.</li>
</ul>
<p>After listening to Marco and David, and reviewing the full scope of what I’ve been trying to build, I’m pretty concerned about this. I’m looking at <a href="https://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, and other metrics internal to my app for judging content and suspicious user accounts, but I may be a little in over my head on this issue.</p>

			<p>Two new microblog-related services have launched. This week, <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/09/0995.html">Dave Winer announced River5</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “So I decided it was time to do a restart of my JavaScript RSS aggregator, and it&#8217;s now ready for Node users &#8212; it&#8217;s called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a>. [&#8230;] This is a foundation for developers to build on, but it&#8217;s also possible for an adventurous user to set up their own rivers.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>River5 is built on a few XML and JSON formats, including River.js. I’m pretty interested in River.js as a format for aggregating multiple feeds together, so I’ve supported it in my new microblog platform. As a next-generation RSS, though, I prefer the proposal I wrote about in a post called <a href="../2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">RSS for microblogs</a>.</p>
<p>Next up is <a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt">twtxt</a>, which attempts to recreate Twitter as a distributed, command-line based system with self-hosted text files:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Instead of signing up at a closed and/or regulated microblogging platform, getting your status updates out with twtxt is as easy as putting them in a publicly accessible text file. The URL pointing to this file is your identity, your account. twtxt then tracks these text files, like a feedreader, and builds your unique timeline out of them, depending on which files you track.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m less sure what to think of twtxt. The simple plaintext format is nice, but we already have a good infrastructure for this with RSS. And <a href="../2016/01/inline-links-in-microblog-posts.html">as I’ve noted before</a>, having HTML in RSS with inline styles and links is nice for microblogs, and it’s not clear to me whether that would fit well with twtxt.</p>
<p>If you want to start an indie microblog, my suggestion remains to use existing blog software that can generate simple RSS feeds. Short posts, no titles. This is a widely-deployed format that we can continue to work with for years to come.</p>

			<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/link/2016/02/twitter-launches-algorithmic-timeline-as-an-opt-in-feature/">Dan Moren reports</a> that Twitter is rolling out their algorithmic timeline, where tweets aren&#8217;t strictly reverse-chronological. It is opt-in for now, and likely won&#8217;t apply to third-party clients:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I’d also guess that third-party clients won’t be able to implement this for a while, if ever. So users of Tweetbot, Twitterrific, and others won’t really have a substantively different experience.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t see the setting in my Twitter account yet. As a user, I hardly care, because I don&#8217;t read the Twitter timeline directly anyway. But I&#8217;ll be watching how people react to this and how it might affect my own microblogging plans.</p>

  &#8220;The point is that publishing on Medium and Twitter and Facebook gives you an immediate shortcut to a huge audience, but of course those companies’ interests are in themselves, not in building <em>your</em> audience, so it’s very easy for them to change things around in a way that totally screws you over (remember Zynga? Yeah, me either).&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>My current thinking on Medium is that it’s a shortcut to building an audience for <em>a single post</em>, but doesn’t really help build a true audience. In other words, you will get more exposure, and maybe one of your posts will be lucky enough to be recommended and included in Medium’s daily email, but after someone finds it they aren’t as likely to read your other posts and subscribe to your entire site.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t talk about silos like Twitter and Medium without talking about cross-posting. <a href="http://noahread.net/blog/twitter-10k">Noah Read says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;While it is relatively easy to post to a blog, syndicating that content to Twitter, Facebook, or Medium still requires additional configuration, which many users won’t do. I think it would be in blogging software’s interest to make these <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE</a> features a standard part of their core product. In order for the open web to not lose ground, ironically they will need to play nicer with closed platforms than they are likely to receive in return.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about this too. For beta users of my new product, I&#8217;ve been telling people to use IFTTT to wire up cross-posting to Twitter. But that&#8217;s another step that will be confusing to people — an opportunity to lose interest and give up. Cross-posting should be a core feature.</p>

			<p>The flip side to the optimism of <a href="../2015/08/doubt-with-screenshots.html">my last post</a> is the hard reality that sometimes the doubt <em>is</em> warranted. Sometimes, a little caution could lead to better, more reasonable business decisions.</p>
<p>I like <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2015/07/24/in-defense-of-pessimism/">this post from Brett Terpstra</a> about how his wife provides some balance:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “For every wild idea I plan out, she reminds me of the realistic outcomes, backed with historical data. If it weren’t for the tempering quality of having &#8216;pessimists&#8217; around, I’d be living in a tiny apartment, buried in debt, and likely friendless.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to do a better job of bouncing ideas off other people before fully committing, while still holding on to a strong enough original concept that I can&#8217;t get too distracted or discouraged. I also have a new idea to help lay the groundwork for my new microblogging service, before actually shipping it. Hope to announce more in the next couple of weeks.</p>

			<p>My good friend and Core Intuition co-host <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel Jalkut</a> isn&#8217;t convinced. After we recorded last week&#8217;s podcast, we talked privately about the direction I&#8217;m headed in. He&#8217;s seen the projects I have in development, but he thinks working on Mac apps is a safer bet than web services. And he works on a blogging app, so if I can&#8217;t convince him that the goals I have around microblogging-related tools can be a real business, how am I going to convince the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Earlier this year I gave a talk at CocoaConf about tips I&#8217;ve learned to be productive while juggling multiple projects. But as I worked on the talk, it turned out to be about something else. It was about Walt Disney moving from Kansas City to Hollywood. It was about crazy side projects that no one else believed in. It was about Texas Hold &#8216;Em poker and risking everything for an idea.</p>
<p>The new microblogging app and service I&#8217;ve been working on, off and on for the last year, is the most ambitious project I&#8217;ve ever attempted. It is difficult to explain and market, it might only resonate with a niche audience, and it is going to increase my hosting costs. So part of me knows that Daniel is right — that the smart business decision is to put it on hold and focus on my Mac apps, which will probably have more predictable revenue.</p>
<p>And yet, this project is also the most meaningful. In the words of Peter Thiel, it could take independent microblogging from <a href="http://zerotoonebook.com/">zero to one</a>. A new push forward for weblogs, maybe the first in a while. Therefore, I must do it, and I must accept some risk in the process.</p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been working on the iPhone version. When you look at these screenshots, it might be tempting to compare it to Twitter. Don&#8217;t. Instead, think about how the plumbing fits together: RSS, microblogs, and the open web.</p>
<p><img src="../images/2015/snippets_iphone_screenshots.png" width="607" height="344" alt="screenshot" border="0" /></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to officially announce and ship this. If you&#8217;d like to get an email when the beta is ready, <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the announcement list</a>.</p>

			<p>As I was writing <a href="../2015/08/2959.html">some documentation</a> this week, I kept thinking about what makes great marketing copy. 37signals used to say that <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Copywriting_is_Interface_Design.php">copywriting is a form of user interface design</a>. That&#8217;s true but I think there&#8217;s more to it.</p>
<p>The best products don&#8217;t just have marketing copy; they have a mission statement. They don&#8217;t just sell a tool; they sell a movement.</p>
<p>When I stare at my product wondering if it&#8217;s too confusing — if it&#8217;s too different, and tries to do too many things, to be immediately understood by new users — I try to remind myself that it&#8217;s an opportunity. Instead of simply explaining what I&#8217;m doing, how can I pitch it in a way that strengthens a community around the idea. Because dozens of bloggers can spread the idea more quickly and in a more meaningful way than I can by myself.</p>
<p>And unlike a one-way press release, a community is inherently two-way. Every mention of the idea is both marketing <em>and</em> feedback. Someone blogs about how they&#8217;re excited for the product, but also how they wish it had a certain missing feature. Someone in the press writes a review, but also with a pros and cons list.</p>
<p>This cycle means the product gets better. And if we&#8217;re thoughtful in that first approach to marketing copy, then every blog post, review, and tweet that follows is laced with a little part of our mission statement.</p>

			<p>It&#8217;s a common theme for Dave Winer to write about preserving our writing on the web. <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/08/17/criteriaForFuturesafety.html">Today he outlines some criteria</a> for judging whether a web host will last:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The concern is that the record we&#8217;re creating is fragile and ephemeral, so that to historians of the future, the period of innovation where we moved our intellectual presence from physical to electronic media will be a blank spot, with almost none of it persisting.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think about this in 2 parts. The first is publishing your weblog to your own domain name. This ensures that your writing doesn&#8217;t go away and links don&#8217;t break when your web host goes out of business, because you can copy your content somewhere else and map your domain to that new location.</p>
<p>The second is some kind of host that will last forever. This is an unsolved problem. Hosting fees need to be paid, domain name registrations need to be renewed. It may be too big a leap to ever get there, but we could settle instead for better mirroring of content. I&#8217;d like to have my content mirrored automatically to GitHub Pages, for example, and maybe even Medium.</p>
<p>Imagine the life of a printed book from the early 20th century that has now survived generations. How was this possible? Many copies must have been printed, because some will inevitably be lost or destroyed. And when a library or bookstore is closed, copies of the book must be transferred to a new location.</p>
<p>This all follows naturally with a printed book, but to adopt the same pattern for digital works, we must go out of our way to create a system of mirroring and long-term storage that tries to match what happens in the real world automatically. It&#8217;s a great challenge.</p>
<p>Unfortunately very little has changed on this topic since <a href="../2012/07/permanence.html">I wrote about permanence 3 years ago</a>. But we can change that. Open formats and auto-mirroring will be a key part of <a href="../2015/07/sneak-peek-screenshot.html">my new microblogging platform</a>.</p>

			<p>I need to set aside some time to contact folks in the press about my new project. I can tell just explaining the app to my friends that it’s confusing to understand on first glance. It’s different enough from existing social networks that it requires a high-level explanation for why I designed the architecture this way.</p>
<p>The short answer is that I wanted to build something open and extensible. Something that embraced the open web. By necessity that makes the concept a little more geeky than what has come before it. Having reviews of the product out in the wild even before the app is fully released may help get people thinking about what to expect.</p>

			<p>For the first time in weeks, we had nothing going on this morning and could sleep in. After a late breakfast I worked on implementing a better trial for my new product, letting the <a href="../2015/07/two-weeks-notice-your-business-model-is-wrong.html">business model advice I mentioned yesterday</a> sink in.</p>
<p>Ryan Irelan, who founded <a href="https://mijingo.com/">Mijingo</a> to create books and video courses for developers, <a href="http://ryanirelan.com/2015/07/24/mijingo-mistakes.html">wrote today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;One of my biggest mistakes in my first several months of running Mijingo full-time is that I was going too fast.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I probably needed to hear that. I&#8217;m increasingly worried about launching this new project either half-baked or too late, so I&#8217;ve been trying to ramp up the hours I dedicate to it each week. But I&#8217;m scrambling to quickly change fairly major aspects of it. It may be better to slow down to make sure I still have the bigger picture correct.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be traveling some in August, so that rules out releasing anything brand new before the trip. I&#8217;m thinking my focus leading up to that is to send this to the subscribers of my <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">beta announce list</a> first. Both the free parts and paid plans will be open as if it was a finished product, but it will just be limited to an invite-only group. Based on that feedback I&#8217;ll know how close it really is to shipping for everyone.</p>

			<p>How is it Friday already? I have just one week left at my regular job. In addition to <a href="../2015/07/two-weeks-notice-writing-documentation.html">looking at documentation</a>, I talked on a video call with the lead engineer who will take over a couple of my projects. We went over my current bug list (exactly 13 lucky tickets in Jira) and reviewed a few of the trickier outstanding issues.</p>
<p>Nothing like walking through old code, even at a high level, to discover so much outdated cruft that could be redesigned or cleared out. There’s always a little bit of regret: if only I had fixed this one last problem before leaving, or smoothed over this one confusing part of the web UI. But that’s a slippery slope that could go on indefinitely. Web software in particular is evolving and never fully complete.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I continue to get great feedback on my new <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">Riverfold</a> project from the very early beta testers. Bug reports, new ideas, and sometimes a series of questions that basically ends up as: you’re charging the wrong users, what if you tried <em>this completely different way to make money</em> instead?</p>
<p>While I don’t think there’s any direct competition for what I’m building, there are a lot of related services. I’d count even parts of Tumblr and WordPress among the services that are both complementary and in a similar theme to what I want to do. Tumblr makes money primarily through ads. WordPress has ads but (I expect) makes more money through their upgrades: paid custom domains, VaultPress backup, and premium themes.</p>
<p>When choosing a business model for my app, I’ve also been inspired by GitHub’s simplicity. Free for open source projects, which allows you to get a feel for how the entire system works as long as you don’t need private repositories. Paid for organizations, scaling up based on how many projects you have. The success of my project will hang on whether I can mix some of all these models without confusing potential new customers.</p>

			<p>John Saddington, who develops the Mac blog editor Desk, pointed to one of my recent posts <a href="http://blog.desk.pm/pt-indie/">and wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “It does make me ponder, once again, what I’m doing with my so-called ‘career’ and if it’s the ‘right’ one. Although, every single time I think about that I know that I won’t like the answer… yet it always just works. I can’t tell you why or how I found or discovered this cadence, but, to each his own.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Which in turn makes me reflect on my own career. I’ve been extremely lucky. The right jobs just seemed to have presented themselves to me when I needed them. I hope that luck hasn’t led to overconfidence as I take these next steps to become more independent. It would be a glorious failure if my luck runs out just when I need it most.</p>
<p>So I’ll have to work harder. I’ll have to better manage my finances, better plan and execute on new products, and better support each app so they’ll form a sustainable business. As I type this, I’m actually a little nervous for the first time since I put in my notice. Lots to do.</p>
<p>Tonight’s challenge: finish integrating <a href="http://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> into my new app, to provide Markdown syntax highlighting. I had never heard of this JavaScript library before this week. It seems very capable — a big jump forward on a feature I didn’t even think I could provide for 1.0.</p>

			<p>Tonight I worked on some bug fixes to one of the new apps I hope to ship for Riverfold Software. I have just a handful of beta users, but got some good feedback and bug reports last week, things I want to address before opening it up to more users.</p>
<p>When I think of the in-progress apps that I can ship soon to help increase revenue, there are really only 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clipstart 2.0, which will be renamed Sunlit for Mac, to complement the iPhone version.</li>
<li>Unannounced microblogging-related web app, which may also come with iPhone and Mac apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with Sunlit for Mac is that I’m requiring 10.11 El Capitan. So no matter how much progress I make on it, I can’t ship it until Apple releases their next version of Mac OS X. I want to chip away at the new features, but I can’t spend all of my time on it yet. I need to focus attention on projects that have a chance of bringing in additional revenue in the very near future, not by the end of the year.</p>
<p>So the microblogging app — the one I worked on tonight — keeps coming to the front. Since it’s mostly a web app, it has the least number of external API and App Store dependencies that would hold it up. I can ship the core functionality whenever it’s ready. The sooner I get it out the door, the sooner I’ll know if it’s something I can count on as business income.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>When App.net was first taking off, many microbloggers struggled with how to decide where to post their short-form writing. Should they post some topics to Twitter and others to App.net? Should they cross-post everything to both services? At the time, there was an informal consensus that cross-posting was a cheat. It couldn’t take advantage of each platform’s strengths, and followers might often see the same post twice.</p>
<p>I now believe that cross-posting is a good thing. Photos, as one example, are frequently cross-posted to both Instagram and Facebook. Tweets can be sent to Twitter <a href="../2015/06/more-quick-blogging-workflows.html">as well as our own blogs</a>. Many apps like Instagram or Foursquare support and even encourage cross-posting. It’s good for developers because it helps spread knowledge of the publishing app, and it’s good for writers because it means there are multiple copies of our content.</p>
<p><a href="../2015/07/sneak-peek-screenshot.html">It’s no secret</a> that I’m building a microblog aggregation and publishing service. The goal is for us to get back to our roots with blogging — to write on our own web sites first, not as an afterthought to Twitter. Cross-posting is an important bootstrap for that.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a blog, <em>start one today</em>. It takes minutes to set up, and hardly any more time to wire up automatic tweeting <a href="../2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">via IFTTT from your RSS feed</a>. Start with cross-posting and see if something interesting evolves from there.</p>

			<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2015/07/03/tooMuchLinearThinkingInNews.html">Dave Winer writes about Circa</a> and their fundamental mistake of not embracing the open web with easy linking:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Linkblogging is a real thing, and there are people who are good at it. But if there&#8217;s no URL for each story, you can&#8217;t linkblog it. So they didn&#8217;t grow fast enough. I think this is almost mathematical. No one, going forward, should try this. Each story must have a way to get to it through a Web address.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>We can be cynical about what the “open web” means, thinking it’s just marketing or spin. But it’s real and Dave shows how obvious it is to understand. It doesn’t matter if a web site or iPhone app is based around web technologies like HTTP and HTML. If it can’t be <em>linked to</em> or there’s no web API, it isn’t part of the open web.</p>
<p>Linkblogging is a special form of microblogging, and a significant part of Twitter is actually linkblogging. Tools that understand linkblogging will typically reduce the friction of writing by prompting for a quick note to go with a URL that’s already on the clipboard, for example. I don’t usually blog in this style, but I made sure these linkblog posts look great in the platform I’m working on.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="../2015/06/more-quick-blogging-workflows.html">I said</a> that one important facet to microblogging is the timeline experience. This is a basic foundation to Twitter’s success, although they continue to de-emphasize or twist it. Their upcoming Project Lightning will attempt to curate and deliver tweets to you that are important regardless of who you’re following. <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/mathonan/twitters-top-secret-project-lightning-revealed">From Mat Honan’s scoop</a> on the project for Buzz Feed:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Launch one of these events and you’ll see a visually driven, curated collection of tweets. A team of editors, working under Katie Jacobs Stanton, who runs Twitter’s global media operations, will select what it thinks are the best and most relevant tweets and package them into a collection.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/06/twitter-project-lightning-timeline/">David Pierce wrote for Wired</a> with further speculation on what it could mean for Twitter. David starts with the premise that Twitter is basically full of junk:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Sure, yes, everyone’s Twitter is different—that’s one of the service’s best aspects, that you can follow anyone you want and see whatever you want. Unfortunately, this only works if everyone on Twitter isn’t terrible most of the time. They are.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The essay continues, describing Project Lightning as the death of the Twitter timeline as we know it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With this change, Twitter doesn’t have to look like an endlessly flowing, context-free stream of tweets; instead, you can see a hand-curated set of tweets, links, images, and videos related to what’s happening right now. You see one at a time, swiping through them until you get to the end. And there’s an end!”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Since I haven’t seen this new feature, I can’t tell whether it’s a major shift in how Twitter is used. <a href="http://www.macstories.net/linked/twitters-project-lightning/">Federico Viticci is optimistic</a> about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “This is another example of Twitter moving beyond Legacy Twitter and the belief that Twitter is still only a timeline of tweets in chronological order. The company has been enhancing the service with media improvements and design changes aimed at making Twitter less static – the opposite of a traditional timeline. If anything, they&#8217;ve been moving <em>too slowly</em> in this area.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Federico on the value of curation and surfacing great content. But also the timeline must remain at the heart of Twitter, just as a reverse-chronological list of posts has been on every blog home page since the term weblog was coined 18 years ago.</p>
<p>Dave Winer calls these timelines “rivers”, and last week <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/06/19/riverbrowserOpenSourceRelease.html">he open-sourced a browser</a> for the River.js timeline files. Formatted as JSONP, you can think of River.js as conceptually the same as an RSS feed, except that it’s easy to display with HTML using only JavaScript.</p>
<p>I plan to fully support outputting River.js in the project I’m working on. For the last few years, Twitter has had a monopoly on the timeline. We need to break that up. The first step is <a href="../2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">encouraging microblogs everywhere</a>, and the next step is to build tools that embrace the timeline experience. If you’d like to see my take on this, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the project announce list</a>.</p>
