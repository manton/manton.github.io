				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/2016/02/why-slowness-is-killing-the-apple-watch/">Dan Moren wrote an essay for Six Colors last week</a> about why slowness is such a problem for the Apple Watch:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The stale data and the lack of speed means that either you have to stare at your Watch for several seconds and hope the data updates; or tap on the complication to load the Watch app, which as we all know takes a good long while as well; or simply give up and pull out your phone. [&#8230;] It’s not just that the Apple Watch is slow; it’s that it’s slow <em>while promising to be faster</em>.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Both Dan and Jason Snell followed up on this topic in the latest Six Colors subscriber podcast. The problem, they recognized, is that the first Apple Watch tried to do too much. Apple should instead focus on a few core features and make them fast.</p>
<p>Which features? I still use the Apple Watch every single day, and I use it for just three things: telling the time, tracking fitness (including reminding me to stand up), and glancing at notifications.</p>
<p>Some people have stopped wearing their watch every day. Again, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/apple-watch-still-pretty-great.html">that&#8217;s fine</a>. Curtis Herbert was falling into that category, until he went snowboarding with friends and realized how useful the Apple Watch is when you can’t get to your phone or tap buttons. <a href="http://blog.curtisherbert.com/apple-watch-makes-the-perfect-snowboarding-companion/">In an article about the snowboarding trip</a>, Curtis says the Apple Watch’s problems are solvable in future versions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Siri on the Watch will get faster. The battery situation will improve. The Watch as a whole will get faster. We&#8217;re spoiled by iPhone speeds and sometimes forget just how long it took us to get there, and the crap we dealt with until then.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not worried about the future of the watch either. Our early expectations were much too high — in contrast with the first iPhone, which exceeded all hopes because it was seemingly from the future already — and it will take a couple more years to catch up to where we’d all like the watch to be. In the meantime, the watch is useful today, even slow-ish.</p>
