				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">written about IPFS</a> before, but <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid</a> (from Tim Berners-Lee himself, among other MIT folks) is another new proposal for a more distributed web. I wasn’t familiar with it until reading <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/ways-to-decentralize-the-web/">this article at Digital Trends</a>, which first makes the case for independent content vs. the big centralized platforms:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Now a handful of companies own vast swaths of web activity – Facebook for social networking, Google for searching, eBay for auctions – and quite literally own the data their users have provided and generated. This gives these companies unprecedented power over us, and gives them such a competitive advantage that it’s pretty silly to think you’re going to start up a business that’s going to beat them at their own game.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The article continues with the types of data you might share in a Solid application:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  For example, you might keep your personal information in one or several pods: the sort of data about yourself that you put into your Facebook profile; a list of your friends, family, and colleagues; your banking information; maps of where you’ve traveled; some health information. That way if someone built a new social networking application—perhaps to compete head-on with Facebook, or, more likely, to offer specialized services to people with shared interests—you could join by giving it permission to access the appropriate information in your pod.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the showcase applications is called Client-Integrated Micro-Blogging Architecture, surely named mostly for its pronounceable acronym. From the <a href="https://github.com/linkeddata/cimba">CIMBA project site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  CIMBA is a privacy-friendly, decentralized microblogging application that runs in your browser. It is built using the latest HTML5 technologies and Web standards. With CIMBA, people get a microblogging app that behaves like Twitter, built entirely out of parts they can control.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Solid and CIMBA are built on the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a>, which in turn is based off of RDF. I’m admittedly biased against RDF, because it often brings with it an immediate sense of over-engineering — too abstracted, solving too many problems at once. I’m glad to see this activity around a distributed web, and I’ll be following Solid, but I also continue to believe that the simple microformats and APIs from the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWebCamp</a> are the best place to start.</p>
