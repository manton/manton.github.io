				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Cieplinski ported his iPhone timer app Fin <a href="http://www.joecieplinski.com/blog/2016/01/25/fin-on-a-bigger-screen/">to the Apple TV</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Three weeks of spare hours here and there to get myself familiar with the HIG, the UI challenges, etc. was well worth the effort, as far as I’m concerned. And now I get to see if any of my users find the TV app useful, or if I pick up any new attention as a result of being there.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hearing stories like this, and thinking about my own apps, I’m convinced that the Apple TV needs split-view support like iPad multitasking. Our apps could be off to the side of the screen while someone uses most of the TV for watching shows or running another full-screen app. Just as I suggested that <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/lightweight-universal-apps.html">lightweight universal apps</a> are okay, there is a class of apps that would <em>become more useful</em> when they don’t have to monopolize the entire TV.</p>
