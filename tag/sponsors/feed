				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/two-weeks-notice-the-first-weekend.html">In my first post</a> I framed the situation as pinning my indie hopes on two things: my own apps and client work. But <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2015/07/20/full-time-indie/">as Daniel points out</a>, I’ve actually lucked into several distinct revenue sources. And one of the most promising continues to be our <a href="http://www.coreint.org/sponsorship/">Core Intuition podcast sponsorships</a> and the companion <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">jobs site</a>.</p>
<p>The podcast got some good news over the weekend as we’re adding another long-term sponsor. We’ve had this company as sponsors in the past, and I’m looking forward to having them back and talking about how I use their products.</p>
<p>Like software, revenue from Core Intuition comes in waves. Sometimes we’ll be booked up for months, other times there will be a drought of sponsors, so we’ll focus on pitching the jobs site instead. Sometimes we’ll get new job listings every day, other times a week will go by with nothing. Since we’re not actively marketing it as if it was a full-time business, we can’t count on any kind of consistency from it.</p>
<p>It’s funny how the podcast worked out, though. We started it just because we thought it would be neat — because we thought we had something to share with the community, back in 2008 when there were very few developer podcasts. We added sponsorships to help justify the time and keep us to a weekly schedule. And now, ironically, the podcast that was <em>about</em> running an indie business will actually help me do just that.</p>
<p>I’m so grateful to listeners new and old who have supported us. I received a bunch of nice “congrats!” emails and mentions on <a href="http://chat.coreint.org/">our Slack channels</a> yesterday. We’re approaching 200 episodes now, over 7 years, and I hope we can continue to keep the podcast interesting for some time to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/07/18/adobe-sponsorship-and-credibility">Marco Arment has a strong post</a> on how sponsorships won&#8217;t change his writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “If a sponsor ever has a problem with something I write, and that affects pending or future sponsorship buys, <em>that’s fine with me</em>. I can find other sponsors. And if I can’t, I’ll write for free, like I did for years.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>This was part of a theme on <a href="http://coreint.org/49">today&#8217;s Core Intuition episode</a> as well, not just sponsorships but also whether having an audience changes how we write tweets and blog posts. Daniel Jalkut and I have been very lucky with Core Intuition so far to have great sponsors: apps and events we already love like Marco&#8217;s own Instapaper, Smile&#8217;s TextExpander, CocoaConf, iDeveloper TV, NSConference, and Glassboard. Eventually we&#8217;ll be approached by more apps and services that we don&#8217;t have as much experience with, but as long as we keep our voice and honesty, I&#8217;m not too worried.</p>
