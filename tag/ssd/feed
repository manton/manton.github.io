				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the most recent <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">Six Colors subscriber</a> magazine, Jason Snell talks about adding an SSD to his Mac Mini home server. It got me thinking about finally upgrading our old family iMac (late 2009!) to give it a little more life, so I ordered a new SSD for it today.</p>
<p>A side note about email newsletters: I subscribe to several, and while I love reading them, I can&#8217;t help but think that this great content should be on the web instead. Perhaps a copy of the newsletter text could be subscriber-only on the web just for the first 3-4 months after it has been published, and then open up to everyone. <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/12/newsletters/">Ben Brooks has some more thoughts</a> from the skeptical side of the newsletter debate.</p>
<p>Back to the iMac. The new SSD cost more than I was expecting ($200 + $50 tools), so I think it will serve mostly as a fun exercise in taking apart computers with my son rather than a great upgrade value. A brand new Mac Mini is still only $500, for example. But because nearly everyone in the family already has their own MacBook, or wants one, doesn&#8217;t seem practical to buy a new shared desktop computer.</p>
