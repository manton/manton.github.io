				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feels like years in the making, but I&#8217;ve finally moved all my domain names to a single provider: DNSimple. The last 3 domains went through toward the end of 2015. They were .io domains, and required calling Network Solutions to unlock. (I own 13 domains, and don&#8217;t plan to add any more for a very long time.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found that the simplicity of having these kind of things consolidated in one place really improves keeping up with hosting and renewals. It&#8217;s the same reason I moved all my private projects to GitHub, even though it would cost more per month. It means less to worry about, so more time for coding.</p>
<p>Since I&#8217;ve often been thinking about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">the lack of permanence on the web</a>, I also want to be more proactive about extending my domain registrations. I renewed manton.org until 2021.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in using DNSimple, use <a href="https://dnsimple.com/r/9fc1dd2e59824b">this referral link</a> for a month free. All my SSL certificates are there too, although I&#8217;m keeping an eye on <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It usually takes a couple problems hitting at once to cause a major server outage. This happened last week when Tweet Marker&#8217;s SSL certificate expired. I have the SSL set to auto-renew, but it still requires manually installing the new certificate, and other problems happened along the way.</p>
<p>First mistake: I didn&#8217;t realize it was expiring. Those emails go to an account I don&#8217;t check very often, littered with spam. And the email to confirm the renewal went to yet another email address that no longer worked. When I had moved the DNS hosting to Amazon&#8217;s Route 53, I had neglected to move over the MX records.</p>
<p>After fixing all of that, I tried updating the app on Heroku to use the new cert, only to get stalled as Heroku&#8217;s new SSL add-on rejected it. Certain I had done something wrong, I fumbled through a dozen Heroku SSL how-to posts before finally reverting to their old SSL add-on. It&#8217;s no longer documented and is in fact actively discouraged by Heroku, but it also has the lucky trait of <em>actually working</em> with my certificate. Updating DNS caused another hour-long delay because of the high TTL.</p>
<p>I sent two support requests during this process, so I thought I&#8217;d rate how each company did:</p>
<ul>
<li>DreamHost: Before I figured out the bad email address, I sent DreamHost a question about why the SSL certificate hadn&#8217;t showed up yet. They responded very quickly, and even included a &#8220;P.S.&#8221; that they were fans of Tweet Marker. Basically they provided excellent support, the best you could ask for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heroku: When the new SSL add-on wasn&#8217;t accepting my certificate, I filed a support request with Heroku as well. The response was an automated reply that they don&#8217;t do support past 6pm. For a hosting company that charges a premium, this was a disappointing response. (They responded first thing the next morning, though.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This SSL glitch was the only significant outage Tweet Marker has had in its first year. I learned a few lessons, took the opportunity to check backups and EC2 servers, and now I&#8217;m ready to move on. Hoping for an even better year 2.</p>
