				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Twiterrific 3.0&#8243;:http://iconfactory.com/home/permalink/1887 is out, with a new price of $15 or free to use with ads. The ads are very effective and difficult to ignore, but really they don&#8217;t take anything away from the Twitter experience. The new version is great, though, and I&#8217;ll be sending my $15 to Icon Factory sometime in the next few days. &#8220;As Fraser Speirs said&#8221;:http://speirs.org/2007/11/02/twitterrific-3/, it&#8217;s a small price to pay to be connected to friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>I post to Twitter much more often than I blog now, and I think I owe some of my followers an explanation. I made a rule for myself early on to <em>only follow people who I have met in real life</em>. I&#8217;ve only made a couple exceptions to this, and none recently. It keeps the flow of tweets easier to manage and relevant.</p>
<p>So if you follow me on Twitter and wonder why I don&#8217;t return the favor, that is why. You probably have interesting things to say, so say hi to me at some future conference so I can add you to my list. I&#8217;ve actually been thinking about taking it one step further and protecting updates, because I tend to post about what (to this blog) have been traditionally private matters. Jury is still out on that decision.</p>
<p>The following numbers are interesting, though. I only do very basic Mint stats for this blog (I just care about referrers, not number of readers), but it does make me wonder how many people read this blog. If you&#8217;re reading this, add a comment to this post. (Haha, gotcha! I don&#8217;t have comments.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From time to time on the &#8220;MacSB list&#8221;:http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/macsb people ask about the value of localization and what percentage of sales come from foreign customers. Since day 1 of &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/ I&#8217;ve always been surprised at how many sales are from Europe. At times it felt as if over half of sales were outside the United States, so I finally ran the numbers to know for sure.</p>
<p>My homegrown customer database doesn&#8217;t actually include the physical address, so I grabbed the last 500 sales from PayPal and wrote a quick script to group the countries. Here&#8217;s the chart:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2007/sales_chart_countries.gif" border="0" height="265" width="341" alt="Wii Transfer countries chart" /></p>
<p>The United States represents just over half. If you add up the other English-speaking countries, it hits 70%. Still, this is a purely English-only piece of software. I&#8217;ve resisted the push to localize until I feel the codebase is better prepared for it, and the UI more stable.</p>
<p>At &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ last year I wrote a custom Rails web app to manage localization resources for both the Mac and Windows products and deal with the outsource translators, and the takeaway from that experience was definitely to go slowly. It&#8217;s easy to end up with a foreign language version that makes compromises and is potentially less useful to customers than the English version. Depending on the size of the product, localization could take weeks or months, time that might be better spent adding features.</p>
<p>Back to the real stats. Why are the foreign numbers so high? I think the weak dollar combined with an already relatively inexpensive price makes Wii Transfer even more of an impulse buy in Europe.</p>
