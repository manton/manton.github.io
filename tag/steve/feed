				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to mostly let John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/17/apple-tv-and-the-web">have the last word</a> on the Apple TV vs. the web debate, because I could write about this every day and my readers would run away before I run out of material. I&#8217;m glad John addressed the Mac vs. the command-line argument, though, because it didn&#8217;t seem quite right to me either. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The difference is that the command-line-less Mac was intended to <em>replace</em> command-line-based computers. The GUI relegated the command-line interface to a permanent tiny niche. Apple TV and Apple Watch aren’t like that at all — they’re not meant to replace any device you already use to access the open web.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the most hopeful part of the Apple ecosystem as it relates to the web. Apple&#8217;s other platforms really do have a great web experience. Remember when web sites were faster and worked better on a PC than a Mac? If anything, the opposite is true now.</p>
<p>One of the themes I keep hearing is that a &#8220;web browser&#8221; on a TV will make for a poor user experience, so don&#8217;t bother. I tried to correct that misunderstanding in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/the-web-without-html.html">this post</a>; it&#8217;s not about standalone Safari, it&#8217;s about web technologies that could be used in native apps. But ignoring that, I think everyone too easily forgets what the mobile web was like before the iPhone.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, from the original iPhone introduction:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;We wanted the best web browser in the world on our phone. Not a baby web browser or a WAP browser — a <em>real</em> browser. [&#8230;] It is the first fully usable HTML browser on a phone.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>That was a breakthrough. I believe the same evolution is possible on tvOS — to include parts of the open web and do it with a great user experience. You can start by weaving it together inside native apps. (I <a href="http://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6066362971586560">filed a bug with Apple</a> yesterday with a suggestion. It was marked as a duplicate.)</p>
<p>The web is at a fascinating, pivotal time right now. It has been shaken up by centralized publishing, closed platforms, and now content blockers. Users no longer value the concepts that made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> special. The web can still have a strong future, but we have to <em>try something</em>, and we have to try it on every platform we can.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two great blog posts yesterday from Brent Simmons that I think are related, though I read one early in the day and the other catching up on RSS feeds late at night. First, <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/12/12/one_year_anniversary">on quitting his job</a> to work full-time on Vesper:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “A year ago I was a designer for an enterprise app I didn’t care about — or even like in the least tiny bit — and which you’ve never seen or heard of. That’s no way to live.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It reminds me, of course, of the famous Steve Jobs quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And then, <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/12/12/the_stream">Brent says about Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The 140-character stream is where things not worth saying, and not worth reading, thrive. It’s where things actually worth saying get over-simplified and then get lost, if they get said at all.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, do something you care about, write something lasting. The older I get, the more both of these resonate with me. And even though I haven’t posted to Twitter in over a year, I think I needed to read that post to focus back on this blog, where my writing should live.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been &#8220;iTunes-free for four weeks now&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/goodbye_itms.html, and I hate it. It must be like quitting smoking, except without the fear of dying always at your back. I stopped by a Best Buy the other day and <em>couldn&#8217;t find any CDs to buy</em>. How do you shop for music without listening to it first? How do you find new artists without &#8220;customers also bought&#8230;&#8221; sidebars? Years ago I might listen to the radio to discover new music, but that was before the dial was permanently stuck on NPR.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steve Jobs dropped the bomb&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/ while I was at lunch yesterday, and I furiously read and re-read it and watched the fallout. Blog entries in NetNewsWire lit up like clockwork. As &#8220;I posted to Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton, when the balance tips again to user control we&#8217;ll look back at this as a real shift in thinking. And the reason you know it&#8217;s true is because it sounds redundant to say the words.</p>
<p>But today&#8230; I browsed for music on iTunes and then ordered CDs from Amazon.</p>
