				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just published <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/01/episode-5-mailing-stickers/">episode 5</a> of my new short-format podcast, Timetable. I&#8217;m having a <em>lot</em> of fun with this. Producing an episode that&#8217;s only 5 minutes long means I can experiment without investing too much time.</p>
<p>As I was listening to some other podcasts this week talk about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/twitters-10k-limit.html">the Twitter news</a>, it occurred to me how important it is to have a good mix of podcasts, just as it is with blogging. Many of the most popular Apple-related podcasts hit the same news stories each week and have nearly the same opinion. Don&#8217;t get me wrong; I listen to a bunch of them and they&#8217;re great. But it&#8217;s a reminder to me that for Timetable, and especially for <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a>, not to be afraid of having a more contrarian role when it&#8217;s appropriate.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing controversial in the latest episode of <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/">Timetable</a>, though. Just me talking about getting some stamps to finally send out <a href="https://twitter.com/riverfold/status/651509114284044288">stickers</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We posted <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/10/episode-202-juggling-more-than-ever/">episode 202 of Core Intuition</a> yesterday. This was a fun episode because we didn&#8217;t plan for it; we just started talking. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Manton and Daniel discuss the paralysis of choosing what to work on as an indie, Manton’s mysterious Kickstarter campaign, and the allure of company stickers and other marketing stuff.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Make sure to listen through the end for why I ordered <a href="https://twitter.com/riverfold/status/651509114284044288">stickers for my new app</a>. If you want one, you can <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">email me</a> or send us <a href="mailto:feedback@coreint.org">podcast feedback</a>.</p>
<p>As I said on the show, I highly recommend checking out <a href="http://www.relay.fm/tc">Thoroughly Considered</a>, the companion podcast for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/obi-a-smart-laser-toy-for-pets">Studio Neat&#8217;s Kickstarter project</a>. While you&#8217;re there, also consider backing the project, at the podcast level or the full Obi product if you have a pet that would love it. Even if it doesn&#8217;t successfully fund, I really enjoyed the first couple episodes of their podcast and hope it continues.</p>
