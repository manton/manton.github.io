				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the best pieces of advice that I never followed very well is that if you want to be a better artist, always have a sketchbook with you. That’s why I’ve been so excited about the Apple Pencil, since it transforms the tablet you might already have with you into a great sketchbook too. There&#8217;s only one problem: you have to actual remember to bring the Apple Pencil everywhere.</p>
<p>Myke Hurley gave <a href="http://mykewasright.com/post/142625337481/apple-pencil-hacks">an overview on his blog</a> about some of the additions he&#8217;s purchased to customize his Apple Pencil, like a clip, stickers, and this loop to hold it to the iPad Pro:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Wherever my iPad Pro goes, I want the Pencil to be with it. So to make sure I didn’t have yet another thing to remember, I decided that I had to find a way to attach the Pencil to the iPad. And that’s when I came across the <a href="http://www.cultpens.com/i/q/LC22369/leuchtturm1917-pen-loop">Leuchtturm1917 Pen Loop</a>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2016/04/12/ep-151">the latest The Talk Show</a>, Serenity Caldwell shares the tip of buying a $2 Micron pen and snapping off the clip to use on the Apple Pencil. <a href="https://twitter.com/DogRoomProds/status/669209496720416769">See this tweet</a> for what it looks like.</p>
<p>Lately I had been carrying the iPad Pro around <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/04/3815.html">without a bag</a>. This also meant leaving my Apple Pencil at home. While I don&#8217;t use my Apple Pencil every day, <em>I want to</em>. With a bag I can carry the iPad more easily and also always have a spot for headphones and the Apple Pencil.</p>
<p>I ordered the Tom Bihn <a href="https://www.tombihn.com/collections/briefcases-and-messenger-bags/products/daylight-briefcase">Daylight Briefcase</a> and I&#8217;ve been using it all week. You can see it in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/04/bee-cave-public-library.html">this photo</a> I took while setting up to work at a library the other day. I haven&#8217;t used a messenger-style bag in a long time, maybe in forever. (Apple handed out one to WWDC attendees years ago before they transitioned to the jackets phase of WWDC of freebies, but I gave most of my bags away.)</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;m really enjoying having a bag that doesn’t feel oversized for the iPad Pro. It&#8217;s much smaller than my full backpack. I expect that it will be perfect not just around town but also for traveling light.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we talk about on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/11/episode-208-crazy-and-doomed-to-failure/">Core Intuition episode 208</a>, I finally got an Apple Pencil. It&#8217;s great. My experience matches <a href="http://shapeof.com/archives/2015/11/the_hype_is_real.html">Gus Mueller&#8217;s</a>, about how good the Apple Pencil is after years of using Wacom tablets and third-party iOS styluses:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I find that when using the HB Pencil in Procreate, I get something that is very, very close to what I feel when I&#8217;m drawing in my sketchbooks. But of course now I&#8217;ve got layers and many colors and a perfect eraser to work with. And endless pages. I love it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the question of whether it&#8217;s a &#8220;stylus&#8221;, <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/11/pencil-2/">Ben Brooks sums it up</a> this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;That’s the question I get asked a lot from people — my wife especially. Apple will tell you it is not a stylus because it is so much better than any other stylus, it clearly is something else. So, instead, I’ll tell you that it <em>is</em> very much a stylus — it just so happens to be the best stylus I have ever encountered on any device.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been improving the Apple Pencil support in an iPad app I&#8217;m working on. I haven&#8217;t completely finished reading <a href="http://www.russbishop.net/uitouchtypestylus">Russ Bishop&#8217;s article</a> on supporting the Apple Pencil, but looks like it has a bunch of additional tips in it that I&#8217;d benefit from. It covers not just the API changes to UITouch, but also gestures, coalescing, and predictive touches.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I ordered my iPad Pro online and picked it up in the store today. My excitement for this device is all about the Pencil, which doesn&#8217;t ship for a few more weeks. The store didn&#8217;t receive any and employees have no idea when they will get it. They didn&#8217;t receive any Apple keyboards either, so I left with the only remaining accessory in stock: the white smart cover.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been less excited to walk out of a store with a brand new $800 gadget. The iPad Pro has <em>so much potential</em>. I think it&#8217;s going to be a success and I&#8217;m building apps for it. But without the Pencil and keyboard, a significant part of the appeal is missing. And worse, developers who need a Pencil to start testing their apps — especially those apps like the one I&#8217;m working on that already supports third-party stylus pressure — are put at a month-long disadvantage compared to Adobe and the other early partners.</p>
<p>I enjoyed reading the iPad Pro reviews this morning, especially from <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2015/11/the_ipad_pro">Daring Fireball</a> and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-review/#software-keyboard">MacStories</a>. But those reviews describe a product that just doesn&#8217;t exist today. The iPad Pro as advertised on Apple&#8217;s web site and in beautiful marketing videos isn&#8217;t ready, and I wish Apple had delayed the whole launch until they could deliver these important accessories for a complete user experience.</p>
