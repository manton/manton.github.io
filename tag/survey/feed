				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://devmate.com/mac-dev-survey">DevMate surveyed 679 Mac developers</a> to put together a report on who is using the Mac App Store vs. selling direct, what concerns developers have, which tools they use, and more. On why developers leave the Mac App Store:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If you’re thinking giving away 30% of your hard-earned revenue is the deal-breaker, you’d be surprised. Revenue share is not the main reason developers flee. The main reason is the long and unclear App Review process, closely followed by revshare and the absence of trial versions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While sandboxing does show up on the complaint list, it’s ranked low as a reason to not use the Mac App Store, even though <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/02/sandboxing_and_clipstart.html">it was why</a> I pulled my app Clipstart from the Mac App Store 4 years ago. And not much has changed since I wrote about Sketch and other apps leaving the Mac App Store <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/12/too-late-to-save-the-mas.html">last year</a>.</p>
<p>For anyone who has been following blog posts and conference talks about the Mac App Store, there won&#8217;t be many surprises in this new survey, but I found the details interesting. The survey appears to be a good snapshot of how the Mac community is feeling about selling software.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I sent out a newsletter to all my &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ customers. You can see the &#8220;text of the newsletter here&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/newsletter/2009/07.html. I wasn&#8217;t sure how effective this would be, but I immediately got a bunch of responses to the survey, and hopefully more interest in Clipstart too.</p>
<p>I decided against doing any specific tracking for number of views and links clicked, but there was an obvious spike in traffic for a couple hours as people clicked on the links in the email.</p>
<p>The survey results are about what I expected. Most people are buying Wii Transfer to watch movies and listen to music on their TV. I&#8217;ll use this feedback to simplify the user interface around these features, and prune back a feature set that had grown a little too fast for its own good.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a chart of the results so far:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2009/wt3survey.png" alt="Survey chart" border="0" width="524" height="270" /></p>
<p>I used &#8220;Campaign Monitor&#8221;:http://www.campaignmonitor.com/ for sending the newsletter, and as usual I&#8217;m very pleased with how simple they make this. I did a full customer export from my registration database and Campaign Monitor merged it with the existing list from my newsletter last year, weeding out duplicates and removing anyone who had already unsubscribed.</p>

<p>Consensus: most people like commas and everyone likes Flickr. (The second takeaway here is that the service or app is more important, since Flickr uses spaces and everyone seems to cope just fine, even that 66% who prefer commas.)</p>
