				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m going to skip the usual Macworld predictions and cut straight to the good stuff: Apple needs a tablet for the huge numbers of artists and creative professionals who have stuck with the Mac for so long, or who are finally coming back to the platform. I hope for this every year, but the evidence is starting to mount that yes, Apple is working on something.</p>
<p>John Gruber &#8220;doesn&#8217;t see a tablet happening&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2008/01/macworld_expo_predictions:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;But why force software UI&#8217;s designed for traditional hardware form factors upon a totally different device? A successful tablet-like device from Apple, I think, would clearly be designed as a secondary computing device &mdash; a satellite attached and synched to a Mac or PC (probably, of course, through iTunes).&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think his reasoning is exactly correct <em>if</em> you think about a tablet as just a Newton or large iPhone, but as I say above I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the market at all. Honestly as much as I loved the Newton, the iPhone works great as a replacement. The primary market for a Mac tablet is the millions of people who look at the &#8220;Wacom Cintiq&#8221;:http://www.wacom.com/cintiq/ and drool. An Apple tablet has to run full Mac OS X because it has to run Photoshop, Acorn, and Painter.</p>
<p>(Both Gruber and Dan Benjamin also discuss predictions during the latest &#8220;The Talk Show episode&#8221;:http://www.thetalkshow.net/, just posted. While you&#8217;re listening, also check out the &#8220;Hivelogic comprehensive podcasting guide&#8221;:http://hivelogic.com/articles/podcasting-equipment-guide/.)</p>
<p>So what about this: what if the MacBook sub-notebook and the tablet are one and the same? Imagine a beautiful slim MacBook with a detachable keyboard and touch-sensitive display, for example. Avoid the weird connections by making the keyboard Bluetooth only, with all the guts of the machine (including flash-based hard drive) behind the screen. I have a first-generation Toshiba Tablet PC and the hardware design is just bulky and terrible because they tried to make it all things to all people. A MacBook Nano-Tablet-Air could embrace &#8220;thin&#8221; and &#8220;tablet&#8221; and ignore everything else to achieve a truly great design.</p>
<p>But who knows. We&#8217;ll see in about 30 minutes.</p>
