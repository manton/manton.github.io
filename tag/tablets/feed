				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a great line from <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/04/vision-2/">an iPad Pro article by Ben Brooks</a>, where he&#8217;s discussing how Steve Jobs was always conscious of shipping only Apple&#8217;s best work:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The key difference between Gates and Jobs isn’t the vision, it’s the patience, or if you prefer the unwillingness to ship something which isn’t great.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about the time just before the iPad was announced. We didn&#8217;t know what form it would take, how much it would cost, or even what OS it would run. At the time, I <em>even wanted it to run Mac OS X</em>. From one of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2008/01/give_us_a.html">my blog posts in 2008</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The primary market for a Mac tablet is the millions of people who look at the <a href="http://www.wacom.com/cintiq/">Wacom Cintiq</a> and drool. An Apple tablet has to run full Mac OS X because it has to run Photoshop, Acorn, and Painter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s easy in hindsight to say how wrong I was, that of course it should run iOS. And today I&#8217;d agree; iOS 9 on the iPad is great. But I thought a tablet would be particularly good for artists, and basing it on the Mac would be the only way to hit the ground running with a stylus and mature graphics software.</p>
<p>That brings us back to patience, and how Apple <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1151235/apple_rolls.html">rolls</a> and iterates. It has taken 6 years from the original iPad introduction to the iPad Pros we have today that fulfill what I had hoped a tablet could be. Was it worth the wait? Yes. But that&#8217;s a long time, and a more impatient company might&#8217;ve taken a different path to get here, and they wouldn&#8217;t have been wrong.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not actually thinking about Microsoft here, but Amazon. Amazon is so impatient not just with hardware development but everything else that even overnight delivery for their customers isn&#8217;t fast enough.</p>
<p>When I pre-ordered the Amazon Echo <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/amazon-echo.html">on a whim a year ago</a>, I&#8217;m not sure that Amazon really had any idea what they were doing, whether it would flop or succeed, or if anyone would understand it. A year later, they own the market for this kind of device and it&#8217;s spread by word of mouth because the product is <em>good</em>. If Apple ever makes an Echo competitor it will be years from now and only because someone else proved the idea first.</p>
<p>Patience is good, and I&#8217;m glad that Apple has a great balance between innovating on brand new products and perfecting existing concepts. But I&#8217;m also glad that not every company is as patient as Apple. I think the industry makes better progress when some companies aren&#8217;t afraid to ship something half-baked too early.</p>
