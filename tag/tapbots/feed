				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Çingleton last week, Michael Jurewitz talked about app pricing and the arguments for raising your price. He made a convincing case, and it echoed some of the themes that <a href="http://www.manton.org/2010/06/10_ipad_apps.html">I wrote about before I released Tweet Library 1.0</a> back in 2010.</p>
<p>In the two years since, I never once changed the price. No intro discount, no gimmicks, never on sale; $10 was essentially set stone. Even as it moved to the iPhone as a universal app, I stuck to my original philosophy about pricing, perhaps stubbornly. There’s value in consistent pricing, so that the user knows what to expect from one month to the next, and to indicate that the developer attaches a specific value to the app.</p>
<p>Last week, before Çingleton and right as version 2.1 of Tweet Library was about to be released, I decided to try an experiment: I cut the price in half to $4.99. Even though it’s a niche app that only doubles as a full Twitter client, this puts it more in line with other Twitter apps on iOS. (And even cheaper than buying both the iPhone and iPad versions of some apps, like Netbot for ADN.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tweetbot for Mac is now out at $20. <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2012/10/18/fairly-priced/">Daniel Jalkut covers this</a> on his new blog, Bitsplitting:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Is $20 a reasonable amount to pay for Tweetbot? I think so. But if Tapbots would have preferred to charge even less, has it been fairly priced? Many folks are seizing on the coincidence of Tapbots <em>needing to charge more</em> as an opportunity to exalt ‘fair pricing,’ when this was a result of coercion in two directions.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Pricing is something I am still very fascinated by, especially this constant pull between how we value our own software and how pragmatic we want to be as a business. I’m going to let Tweet Library sit at $4.99 for a month, and if revenue is not obviously greater than what it would have been, I’ll bump it back to $10 or a middle-ground $7.99.</p>
