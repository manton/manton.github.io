				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2010/bookshelf_touch.png" alt="Bookshelf screenshot" title="bookshelf_touch.png" border="0" width="200" height="300" style="float:right;" hspace="10" /> Although I had worked a little on iOS apps before, updating an existing app for the iPad and tinkering with unfinished apps, the first 1.0 for iOS that I played a significant role in just shipped last week: a &#8220;mobile version of Bookshelf&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vitalsource-bookshelf/id389359495?mt=8 for VitalSource. The iPhone version has been in development off and on for a while, but I took over the project fairly late in development, with a coding frenzy through the summer as we switched file formats and scrambled to finish in time for fall students.</p>
<p>Today the app broke into the App Store&#8217;s top 25 for free Education apps.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s designed for existing VitalSource customers, supporting both our file formats (for XML-based reflowable content or PDF-like fixed layout), with synced highlights, figure search, and offline access. At its core the app is 3 parts: a large C++ codebase, brand new Objective-C UI code, and a bunch of clever WebKit and JavaScript work. In many ways it&#8217;s a more difficult project than my other iPad app (still in development), but some great coders contributed to different parts of the architecture, before and after I joined the project.</p>
<p>Nearly 10 years ago, when I was hired at VitalSource to build the Mac version of our e-book reader, we delivered textbooks on DVD-ROMs and our technology was years ahead of everyone else. Today, and especially post-iPad, the market is a lot different, with some beautiful competition like &#8220;Inkling&#8221;:http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inkling/id379351586?mt=8. Bookshelf for iPhone wasn&#8217;t first to the App Store, but it inherits an existing user base, strong platform, and large book inventory. I like VitalSource&#8217;s chances.</p>
