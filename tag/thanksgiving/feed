				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we published <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/11/episode-260-invitation-to-failure/">episode 260</a> of Core Intuition. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Daniel and Manton discuss Sal Soghoian’s sudden departure from Apple, and what it may mean for Apple’s future ambitions with automation. Then they react to Apple’s alleged decision to abandon their line of AirPort branded routers, and bemoan the loss of yet another “just buy the Apple one” peripheral option
</p></blockquote>
<p>I liked the topics for our show this week because it allowed us to not just talk about AppleScript as it exists today, but also to reflect on what life developing scriptable apps was like in the early days of AppleScript. It&#8217;s always fun to think back on 1990s Mac development.</p>
<p>Many of our listeners are celebrating Thanksgiving today. To all of our listeners, whether you&#8217;ve listened since the beginning in 2008 or just recently discovered the podcast, thank you so much for giving our show a chance and for being part of the community. Daniel and I still feel incredibly lucky that we get to chat every week about Apple news and our work as indie developers.</p>
