				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve really been neglecting this blog. I&#8217;m not sure what it is &mdash; I have plenty of posts in draft form and it&#8217;s not particularly hard to hit the &#8220;Send to Weblog&#8221; button.</p>
<p>Speaking of people who wrote MarsEdit, our sixth episode of &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ is out. Daniel and I spend a good chunk of the show on bug tracking, thoughts on running a software business while preparing for a new baby, staying inspired and getting distracted, and a bunch more. Plus we put out a call for good artists to contact us.</p>
<p>We had a lot of fun with the show and I hope you enjoy listening to it. If you have feedback, send an email or &#8220;post a comment on Daniel&#8217;s blog&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/544/core_intuition_6.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Episode 11 of &#8220;The Talk Show&#8221;:http://www.thetalkshow.net/ is up, and I&#8217;m happy to say that &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ is this week&#8217;s sponsor. Even if you&#8217;ve been subscribed since the first show, click over to see the new site design by &#8220;Airbag Industries&#8221;:http://airbagindustries.com/. It&#8217;s beautifully done and I tried to create an ad graphic that feels at home there.</p>
<p>For the Wii Transfer ad text I included &#8220;Only for Mac&#8221;, partly to discourage any Windows listeners from clicking and to set expectations that Wii Transfer is not a web site, but also because after a decade of being ignored I think Mac users like to be reminded that there is a bunch of great software just for them.</p>
<p>Earlier this month &#8220;Daniel Jalkut wrote about the unlikelihood of MarsEdit for Windows&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/394/blogging-from-windows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I love writing software for the Mac. If I had to write software for another platform, I probably wouldn&#8217;t be nearly as interested in doing it. Heck, I might work more on becoming a musician, or a designer, or one of the other many trades that I have an interest in. For that reason, the chances of MarsEdit for Windows are almost nil.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I love that Mac indies are receiving so many &#8220;what about a Windows version?&#8221; requests. I get similar emails every couple weeks about Wii Transfer for Windows, and luckily there are a couple Windows or open source alternatives that I can point people to. (Some of them are even cross-platform and available for Mac, but they are of the &#8220;double click this Java .jar file&#8221; variety, so I don&#8217;t generally consider them direct competition.)</p>
<p>It used to feel strange getting these requests. I would respond with &#8220;maybe&#8221; and &#8220;unlikely&#8221;, suggesting that it&#8217;s probably not going to happen but leaving open the possibility, as Daniel did when he said &#8220;almost nil&#8221;. Then I realized &mdash; who am I kidding? &mdash; I&#8217;m <em>never</em> going to port this to Windows regardless of demand. Never. &#8220;With the right team&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ I enjoy working on cross-platform apps, just as I appreciate meetings, planning, and the other formalities (in moderation) that come with a more corporate environment. But Wii Transfer isn&#8217;t about any of that; it&#8217;s my vacation from the real world, and on my time I use and build for Macs.</p>
<p>Also read the Airfoil for Windows section of &#8220;Ars Technica&#8217;s interview with Paul Kafasis&#8221;:http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/2/2/6863 from February.</p>
