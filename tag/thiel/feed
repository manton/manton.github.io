				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About 2 years ago I read Peter Thiel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296">Zero to One</a> while traveling. It quickly became one of my favorite business books. I&#8217;ve always thought we should strive to create truly new products, not just better versions of old ideas. I referenced the book in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/08/doubt-with-screenshots.html">one of my blog posts</a> about Snippets.today.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t until <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/26/11781406/peter-thiel-admits-bankrolling-hulk-hogan-gawker-lawsuit">the Gawker lawsuit</a> that I bothered to learn more about Thiel. It&#8217;s disappointing enough that anyone I respected was on stage at the Republican National Convention, a 4-day train wreck that I expect years from now the GOP will look back on with embarrassment. Now Thiel&#8217;s giving over $1 million to Trump.</p>
<p><a href="https://marco.org/2016/10/17/shame-on-y-combinator">Marco Arment makes the case</a> for Y Combinator distancing itself from Thiel:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Wrapping reprehensible statements or actions as “political beliefs” doesn’t protect them or exempt their supporters from consequences. Racism is racism. Sexual assault is sexual assault. Labeling reprehensible positions as “political beliefs” is a cowardly, meaningless shield.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we should use the word &#8220;shame&#8221; lightly. It&#8217;s used jokingly too often in our industry; for example, &#8220;shame on you&#8221; for not using my favorite app or listening to my favorite show. But on this serious topic, I agree with the content of Marco&#8217;s post completely.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My good friend and Core Intuition co-host <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel Jalkut</a> isn&#8217;t convinced. After we recorded last week&#8217;s podcast, we talked privately about the direction I&#8217;m headed in. He&#8217;s seen the projects I have in development, but he thinks working on Mac apps is a safer bet than web services. And he works on a blogging app, so if I can&#8217;t convince him that the goals I have around microblogging-related tools can be a real business, how am I going to convince the rest of the world?</p>
<p>Earlier this year I gave a talk at CocoaConf about tips I&#8217;ve learned to be productive while juggling multiple projects. But as I worked on the talk, it turned out to be about something else. It was about Walt Disney moving from Kansas City to Hollywood. It was about crazy side projects that no one else believed in. It was about Texas Hold &#8216;Em poker and risking everything for an idea.</p>
<p>The new microblogging app and service I&#8217;ve been working on, off and on for the last year, is the most ambitious project I&#8217;ve ever attempted. It is difficult to explain and market, it might only resonate with a niche audience, and it is going to increase my hosting costs. So part of me knows that Daniel is right — that the smart business decision is to put it on hold and focus on my Mac apps, which will probably have more predictable revenue.</p>
<p>And yet, this project is also the most meaningful. In the words of Peter Thiel, it could take independent microblogging from <a href="http://zerotoonebook.com/">zero to one</a>. A new push forward for weblogs, maybe the first in a while. Therefore, I must do it, and I must accept some risk in the process.</p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been working on the iPhone version. When you look at these screenshots, it might be tempting to compare it to Twitter. Don&#8217;t. Instead, think about how the plumbing fits together: RSS, microblogs, and the open web.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait to officially announce and ship this. If you&#8217;d like to get an email when the beta is ready, <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the announcement list</a>.</p>
