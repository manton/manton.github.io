		<description><![CDATA[Rob Rhyne wrote an essay last week that caught my attention, on Tim Cook and the incredible pace of new major OS versions at Apple: “Still think Apple isn’t innovating enough under Tim Cook? Don’t let an app developer hear that talk—they want a vacation, and the end of 2015 showed no signs of relief.” [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://rd2.io/2016/01/tim-cooks-apple/">Rob Rhyne wrote an essay last week</a> that caught my attention, on Tim Cook and the incredible pace of new major OS versions at Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Still think Apple isn’t innovating enough under Tim Cook? Don’t let an app developer hear that talk—they want a vacation, and the end of 2015 showed no signs of relief.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>But I found it significant for another reason too: Rob hadn’t blogged on that site in over 2 years. He picked it up as if no time had been lost, hitting the ground running with a great post.</p>
<p>He’s not the only one starting to blog more. Matt Gallagher just <a href="http://cocoawithlove.com/blog/2016/01/25/a-new-era-for-cocoa-with-love.html">rebooted Cocoa with Love</a> after 4 years since his last post. Swift was a good excuse to resume writing, but he had wanted to continue the site anyway.</p>
<p>Most of my favorite blogs have new posts every day, or at least once a week. New posts bring more links and traffic, giving the blog life and momentum.</p>
<p>There’s no single correct way to blog, though. Blogs are forgiving. If you’ve neglected your blog for a while, you don’t owe anyone an apology. Just hit command-N in your favorite text editor and start writing.</p>
