				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I published 2 new <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable</a> episodes this week, with a shared theme around Kickstarter projects. They&#8217;re both just 5-6 minutes long.</p>
<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/04/episode-19-kickstarter-recording/">Episode 19</a> is about how I finally sat down to record a video for my upcoming Kickstarter project. I still have editing to do, but I&#8217;m already feeling a lot better about actually launching this.</p>
<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/04/episode-20-kickstarter-rewards/">Episode 20</a> continues the discussion of Kickstarter, starting with my reaction after receiving the art book from <a href="http://blog.loish.net/">Loish</a> yesterday. I was really impressed with how well it was produced. Anytime I see something of such high quality I&#8217;m inspired to do a better job with my own work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/03/episode-18-waiting-for-the-se/">On episode 18</a> of my Timetable podcast, which I just published this morning, I mention the new Nintendo game Miitomo. Federico Viticci <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/miitomo-for-ios-goes-live-internationally/">also wrote about it today</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <a href="https://www.macstories.net/?s=Miitomo">I’ve been keeping an eye on Miitomo</a> – I still don&#8217;t completely understand it, but I&#8217;m intrigued by the premise of a friend-based network with mini-games and the ability to collect coins. Those coins can then be used to claim rewards and redeem other Nintendo-related content such as games and customizations. I&#8217;m curious to see how Miitomo will perform outside of Japan.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For a several years between 2006 and 2010, I sold and actively worked on a little Mac app called <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/">Wii Transfer</a>. It was the first time I realized that I could make a living selling Mac software, even though it didn&#8217;t always have great sales consistently by itself. To this day, one of the features I’m most proud to have ever written is the Mii export, which could sync Mii data over Bluetooth from the Wii remotes and render it to let you save your Miis as PNG files on your Mac.</p>
<p>I’ve often mused on Core Intuition that I stopped selling the app too soon. At one point I worked on a companion app to the Nintendo DS with similar themes, but didn’t ship it. And I considered building a version for iOS just with the Mii functionality.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/05/saying_goodbye_to.html">From a blog post in 2012</a>, announcing that Wii Transfer would no longer be available:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m retiring Wii Transfer to focus on my other apps. It’s not that it doesn’t sell; it still does. It’s just that it’s not an app I actually use anymore. By officially shelving the whole project, I hope to remove a psychological burden of sorts — to no longer worry that I’m ignoring an active product.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll never know if it was a missed opportunity — a mistake for the direction of my indie business to stop selling something that people liked — or the right call to refocus around what I actually cared about. In any case, I&#8217;m glad Nintendo is doing something new with Miis. As I play with Miitomo, there&#8217;s a part of me that regrets not doing more with Nintendo-compatible software while I had a competitive head start.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starting back in September 2014, I added microblog posts to this site. These are defined as <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">short posts without a title</a>. They have their own RSS feed, and they’re automatically cross-posted to Twitter and App.net.</p>
<p>In that time, I’ve posted about 300 microblog posts and about 230 essays, although many of my longer posts are really just a few paragraphs and a quote. I still find the microblog format very convenient for quick thoughts, or a series of related posts like <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/newcoffee">all my coffee stops</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve also switched from Gaug.es to WordPress.com stats. While I agree with Ben Brooks that <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2015/10/death-to-analytics/">analytics can be a distraction</a>, I still like finding new referrers and having a sense of what posts have resonated with people. Not that it effects what I write about, though.</p>
<p>The key to blogging is still consistency and passion. Write about the things you care about, regularly, and the internet is a big enough place that there can be an audience for even obscure topics.</p>
<p>That’s the theme I’m trying to apply to my new <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable podcast</a>, too. I talk about microblogging, coffee shops, client work, but more important than any of that is the routine of recording it. The short nature of the podcast is itself kind of the story.</p>
<p>I’m at episode 15 now and have loved working on it. I now expect that all of these components of my blog — the longer posts, the microblog posts, and the companion Timetable episodes — will be something I do for years to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Charles Perry has started a microblog. On the balance of what he should post to Twitter and what he should post to his own site first, <a href="http://dazeend.org/2016/02/dazeend-org-microblog/">he writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Most of the things I write on Twitter are snippets of conversations or other thoughts that I don’t necessarily want to preserve. Those will stay on Twitter. But some microposts—is that a thing?—I think are of interest on their own. These I plan to post to the DazeEnd.org microblog and mirror to Twitter. That should allow me to preserve and archive my thoughts on my own website and use Twitter just for distribution.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I was really happy to see these posts show up in my RSS reader. There&#8217;s some momentum around indie microblogging right now. You should start one too.</p>
<p>Here are some more of my posts on the topic:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/04/how-to-start-a-microblog.html">How to start a microblog</a>. Overview of the basics, with a few suggestions for where to start.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">Microblogging with WordPress</a>. Still mostly accurate, although I don&#8217;t use IFTTT anymore. I&#8217;ve written my own cross-posting code and baked it into my new app.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/embrace-cross-posting.html">Embrace cross-posting</a>. My early thoughts on cross-posting. Also see <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/fine-heres-a-twitter-feed.html">the post about returning to Twitter</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">RSS for microblogs</a>. Suggestions for simplifying our RSS feeds, and a proposal for JSON.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.manton.org/category/weblogs/">Weblogs category from my blog</a>. All the posts primarily about weblogs or microblogging.</li>
</ul>
<p>Listeners of my new Timetable podcast also know that I&#8217;m writing a short book about independent microblogging. You can hear a little about this <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/01/episode-9-not-just-an-app/">on episode 9</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I started a new short-form podcast called <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable</a>. Each episode is 3-5 minutes. It has been really fun to record the show because I can try new things without investing too much time.</p>
<p>One goal from the very beginning was to record from iOS so that I could easily record outside the house. I wanted not just the flexibility to be away from my computer, but a stereo microphone that could capture some of the surrounding environment, to give it a more informal feel. (I’m actually cheating in some cases and using multiple tracks, to make editing easier, but I think the effect works. All the episodes have been exported to mono so far, though.)</p>
<p>I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072DKYFO">this cheap iPhone microphone</a> for testing — only $10 when I ordered it! — and figured after some experiments with my iPhone 4S, I would invest in something new. I liked it enough that I’m still using the mic with my 5S via a Lightning cable adapter. I’m also using a foam pop filter that I already had from a previous old mic.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2016/microphone_with_filter.jpg" width="550" height="244" alt="Microphone" border="0" /></center></p>
<p>This may be the single best value in a tech gadget I’ve ever purchased. Total cost for producing the podcast:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072DKYFO">Microphone</a>: $10</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ferrite-recording-studio/id1018780185?mt=8">Ferrite</a>: $20</li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8">Workflow</a>: $3 (for MP3 conversion)</li>
<li>Domain name: $120 (.fm domains are expensive)</li>
</ul>
<p>I certainly didn’t invent the idea of a “microcast”. There are other good short podcasts, such as <a href="http://bitesize.tech/">Bite Size Tech</a>. But I’m happy to see even more people trying out the idea. <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/">Michael</a> even started a new podcast called <a href="http://soitscometothis.net/microcast/">Driftwood</a> to chronicle the development of <a href="https://github.com/LK64076007A/driftwood">his Jekyll template</a> for microcasts.</p>
<p>Ferrite also continues to impress. It’s a very high quality iOS app and is competitive with Mac multi-track audio editors. For a good introduction, check out <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2015/11/editing-podcasts-on-ios-with-ferrite/">Jason Snell’s review</a>.</p>
