				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soundtrack for this blog post: &#8220;The Touch&#8221;:http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=254632798&amp;s=143441&amp;i=254632948 from the 1980s Transformers feature.</p>
<p>Yesterday Apple announced new iPods, plus cool stuff like the Starbucks integration and iTunes Wi-fi Store. I was out at lunch and errands, so I followed the announcements on my iPhone with Safari and Twitter. If the new store had been available, I probably would have bought some music too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave Winer had mixed feelings about the new stuff&#8221;:http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/09/05/will2007BeLike1984.html, but likes how the iPod is evolving to be its own full-featured client:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They are interesting if only because they illustrate so clearly that it&#8217;s possible to get content onto the iPod directly, without synching, without tethering to a laptop or desktop computer. I think the users will love this, and it will quickly become the primary way music gets on the device.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The $200 price drop on the iPhone was a surprise. My first thought: Apple is totally playing to win. With such an aggressive price drop, they plan to own the high-end market, and maybe some of the middle too. It never crossed my mind that I was ripped off paying $599 until I started reading &#8220;comments in this TUAW post&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/09/05/apple-lowers-price-of-8-gig-iphone-to-399/. These are the same kind of people who say &#8220;I like your software but <em>I wish it was free</em>&#8221; to indie Mac developers.</p>
<p>The iPhone was expensive at $599 but worth it, and the new price doesn&#8217;t change that fact. It&#8217;s allowed me to work even more remotely, stay connected to friends, get unlost using maps in a new city, and greatly improve how I use a mobile phone.</p>
<p>(I wrote most of the rest of this blog post a couple weeks ago. It was originally titled &#8220;1000 emails in your pocket&#8221;, but that was before I saw Craig Hockenberry&#8217;s excellent &#8220;Benchmarking in your pants&#8221;:http://furbo.org/2007/08/15/benchmarking-in-your-pants/ blog post, which while not as directly accurate to Apple&#8217;s original iPod marketing, was much more funny.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to post specifically about the sessions at C4 yet, because anything I say would be redundant against posts from &#8220;Alex Payne&#8221;:http://www.al3x.net/2007/08/c41-friday.html, &#8220;John Gruber&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/2007/08/c4_1_in_a_nut, and &#8220;Mike Zornek&#8221;:http://blog.clickablebliss.com/2007/08/13/c41-retrospective/, among others. Instead I want to follow up &#8220;my original iPhone report&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/07/iphone_its_from.html with how the phone performed during travel.</p>
<p>There were a <em>lot</em> of iPhones at last month&#8217;s C4 conference. I had such good luck using the iPhone at the airport and on the train and walking around Chicago, I took my MacBook&#8217;s dead battery as a sign to stick to the iPhone all weekend, using it exclusively for email, Twitter, blog reading, and general web surfing. I responded to a handful of emails, used SMS for sending tweets, and hit the iPhone version of Newsgator Online (synced from my NetNewsWire subscriptions) for news and blogs.</p>
<p>Sure, I was jealous of everyone running Twitterific while I had to refresh m.twitter.com manually, but overall the experience was great. As &#8220;Matt Haughey has blogged about&#8221;:http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2007/07/01/24-hours-with-the-iphone-my-dream-mini-computer/: the iPhone is a computer, and 3 full days of use proved to me that it&#8217;s extremely competent.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to two weeks ago and I went on a weekend road-trip to Dallas with only the iPhone, confident I could respond to email if needed. Same thing over the long Labor Day holiday: drove 7 hours both ways for 2 nights in Louisiana, easily able to follow up on bugs from a recent software release without my MacBook.</p>
<p>Of course there are a few rough edges: I don&#8217;t do significant server-side spam filtering, so deleting spam on the iPhone is getting tedious; paying a premium for SMS is annoying and counter to the unlimited web bandwidth; and my typing is only now to the point of pretty good. But otherwise any limitations with the built-in software are quickly becoming solved with new 3rd-party offerings, which have blossomed faster than most of us expected in no small part thanks to &#8220;Nullriver&#8217;s excellent installer&#8221;:http://iphone.nullriver.com/beta/.</p>
<p>Now the the only question is: what do I do with my &#8220;free $100&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/hotnews/openiphoneletter/?</p>
