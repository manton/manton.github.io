				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been two weeks since I last posted, and with every passing day it becomes more difficult to post something. Why? Because with such a delay I feel that I need to somehow justify it with a great blog post. Just wait another day &#8212; then I&#8217;ll hit my readers (all 2.5 of them) with something great.</p>
<p>Well, something great hasn&#8217;t happened. Instead, I fooled around and added a blogroll to the site, tested Movable Type and Blosxom as possible Radio replacements (not yet), and took notes on things that I&#8217;d like to blog about.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been thinking about what to do with my recently reacquired domain, metacontent.org. I&#8217;ve been looking at <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/">TrackBack</a> closer, and the metacontent.org site might make a good general index of recent metadata-related blog posts. It would use the standalone TrackBack implementation and could be pinged by anyone.</p>
<p>In my old NetNewsWire subscriptions, I had a group named &#8220;Natural Born Bloggers&#8221;. These were mostly old-school bloggers who defy classification, such as Meg with topics that range from web design to <a href="http://www.megnut.com/cooking/002466.asp">cooking</a>, or Dave with technology to <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/01/26#smokersOnly">life lessons</a>. Apparently I&#8217;m just not cut out for that elite group.</p>
<p>The flipside, though, is that I&#8217;ve been getting a great amount of real work done.</p>
