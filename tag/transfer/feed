I finally &#8220;picked up a copy&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/792260641 last night. It was certainly a nice surprise and seems to have brought a small increase in sales.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been wrapping up the next version of Wii Transfer, which hopefully smoothes over most of the rough spots in the current release. After sending beta copies to a few customers, I&#8217;m opening up a &#8220;new forums section&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/forums/ as an experiment in getting early builds out without a more formal public beta. (It&#8217;s not linked from the main site yet, but will be soon.) Every developer handles betas in a different way, but I like the balance Jesse at &#8220;Hog Bay Software&#8221;:http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/ has achieved between his released software page and the early builds and developer notes in the forums section, for those customers willing to dig a little bit below the surface.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This morning I finally rolled out &#8220;version 2.5 of Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/, the most significant release of the product yet. It probably deserved a 3.0 label slapped on it, but I like how all the 2.x releases revolve around the sharing features (sending movies, music, and pictures to the Wii via the Opera browser). Besides, I have a special set of entirely new stuff planned for 3.0.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new? Movie streaming is the big one. You can now drag and drop movie files to convert to Flash Video format, which Wii Transfer&#8217;s web server will happily stream up to your Wii. It works surprisingly well considering the Wii has such limited memory and no hard drive. Last night I even tested with feature-length movies.</p>
<p>Other new features include background music for picture slideshows (both MP3 and AAC) and bookmark sharing, so that you can browse your Safari or Firefox bookmarks on your Wii to easily visit those sites. The &#8220;release notes&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/releasenotes/ page has more of the details.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also bumped the price up to $19, where I expect it to stay for some time. One way I like to think about the price of Wii Transfer is in relation to another common purchase from Wii owners: games. It&#8217;s still less than half the price of a new Wii game.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the beta testers who provided feedback. There are still a number of things about movie sharing that I&#8217;d like to polish up, so additional minor updates are likely. I often use the &#8220;Wii account on Twitter&#8221;:http://twitter.com/wii to post these and other announcements.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the tradition of other independent Mac developers such as &#8220;Mike Zornek&#8221;:http://clickablebliss.com/blog/2007/01/08/billable_the_first_100_days/, &#8220;Daniel Jalkut&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/191/lawful-prey, and &#8220;Gus Mueller&#8221;:http://www.gusmueller.com/blog/archives/2005/12/25.html, I&#8217;m going to share some sales information from the first 75 days of Wii Transfer.</p>
<p>The following chart shows daily sales (in units sold) for each day. I&#8217;ve also highlighted important milestones so you can see what affect they had on sales, such as shipping 2.0 (which brought many links) and increasing the price (from $9 to $14, which brought my first 2.0 day of no sales at all). Finally, there are a few spots where I show the average number of visitors.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2007/sales_75_days.png" width="600" height="220" alt="Sales chart" /></p>
<p>(As an aside, I created this chart in Keynote. I love software that is simple and flexible enough to be used for purposes outside its original developer&#8217;s intentions. I wrote &#8220;more on this subject back in early 2006&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2006/01/limitations_in_toys.html.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to tell, but the numbers on the right side are on average a little bit higher than the left. Not by much though. Sales just trickle in again right now (a few a day).</p>
<p>So what does it all mean? Here is the basic take-away: Sales are much better than I thought they would be, but not nearly enough to live off of. That&#8217;s okay, because I happen to love &#8220;my day job&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ (also writing Mac software). However, I can definitely see how it would be possible to do this full time, with some real marketing and a collection of several additional applications. I have done zero marketing for Wii Transfer except listing it on MacUpdate, VersionTracker, and Apple&#8217;s download site (where it was featured in the video section).</p>
<p>As you can see, there was a big spike in sales when 2.0 was released. This is a direct result of links from Mac sites like The Unofficial Apple Weblog and Daring Fireball, and gaming sites like Jostiq and others. When traffic goes up, sales go up. This opened my eyes because it really is all about getting your app in front of other users. &#8220;As I blogged about previously&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/wii_transfer_takes.html, I think I also missed some sales opportunities during this period because 2.0 was not very stable.</p>
<p>Other interesting stats: The conversion rate is between 2% and 5%. For every 100 downloads, a few people decide to purchase it. I think many active users probably end up paying for it. Instead of a trial demo period, some features are just crippled, and it isn&#8217;t very usable day-to-day without unlocking the full feature set (for example, with music sharing to the Wii, you can only play one song at a time &#8212; no iTunes playlists or shuffle).</p>
<p>There are at least a few pirates too. I&#8217;m not too worried about them because &#8220;you can&#8217;t stop pirating&#8221;:http://wilshipley.com/blog/2007/02/piracy-reduction-can-be-source-of.html, and most people are honest. One customer was even nice enough to tell me about a pirated serial number he found.</p>
<p>To everyone who purchased Wii Transfer, thanks! When I built 1.0, I wasn&#8217;t sure if I would work on it again. Now, several versions later at 2.2, I have a clear roadmap of features (and bugs!) to keep me busy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most interesting (and difficult) parts of running an independent software business is responding to support email. It is very time-consuming and often more frustrating than writing code because the solutions can be illusive. You want to help the customer, but it&#8217;s not always obvious how.</p>
<p>Two blog posts in the last week take entirely different approaches to customer support. &#8220;The first is from Ryan Carson&#8221;:http://www.carsonified.com/web-apps/how-to-deal-with-abusive-customers, who is well known for DropSend and The Future of Web Apps conference. Here&#8217;s a snippet from his response to a customer:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am now marking your email address as spam and your communication will no longer get through. If you don&#8217;t want to use our service any more, please cancel your account.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I was relieved to read the comments, which are more sane. I think Ryan made a mistake in how he dealt with the customer, and wasted a bunch of time in the process. Adding a customer to your spam filter? Yikes. I would have refunded the customer their $5 immediately.</p>
<p>(I actually like a lot of what Ryan writes and the events he puts on, but lately I find myself noticing the differences. As another example, his post about &#8220;outsourcing programming work to Russia&#8221;:http://www.carsonified.com/misc/why-you-need-to-get-rid-of-your-freelance-developer-asap left me puzzled.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Joel Spolsky also wrote an essay&#8221;:http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html on support, and it&#8217;s just about perfect. I especially like his section on <em>memorizing awkward phrases</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s completely natural to have trouble saying &#8216;It&#8217;s my fault.&#8221; That&#8217;s human. But those three words are going to make your angry customers much happier. So you&#8217;re going to have to say them. And you&#8217;re going to have to sound like you mean it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>For almost every support email I get, I start by responding like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hi Bob, Thanks for purchasing Wii Transfer. I&#8217;m sorry to hear it was not working correctly for you.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This does three things right away that I think are important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Greet the person by their name. Kind of like making eye contact. And it&#8217;s respectful without being overly formal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thank them for using the product. If they haven&#8217;t bought it yet, replace &#8220;purchasing&#8221; with &#8220;trying.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apologize that the software gave them trouble. This is mostly equivalent to Joel&#8217;s &#8220;it&#8217;s my fault&#8221; phrase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I could probably respond faster by using some macro shortcuts that do this for me, I actually type this out every time, varying it slightly as is appropriate for the question. I then move on to the actual solution or follow-up question about their issue.</p>
<p>This is more than just trying to be nice to people. As someone in the comments to Ryan Carson&#8217;s post said: you need to show the customer that you are on their side. Going negative demonstrates that you care about receiving their money but not actually building something useful that makes their life easier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a portion of 37signals take on being on the customers side, from &#8220;Getting Real&#8221;:http://gettingreal.37signals.com/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At 37signals, all of our support emails are answered personally by the people who actually build the product. Why? First off, it provides better support for customers. They&#8217;re getting a response straight from the brain of someone who built the app. Also, it keeps us in touch with the people who use our products and the problems they&#8217;re encountering. When they&#8217;re frustrated, we&#8217;re frustrated. We can say, &#8216;I feel your pain&#8217; and actually mean it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Most people who buy Mac software from independent developers know that it&#8217;s only 1-5 people behind the company. We can&#8217;t compete with the Microsofts and Adobes of the world on application size, but we can compete on quality customer service. <em>Being small is a competitive advantage.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve exchanged at least a couple hundred emails in the last few months with customers or potential customers. (I don&#8217;t actually distinguish between users who have bought the product or who are just trying it out. They all get the same level of support.) Have I handled each one perfectly? Probably not. There are a few people who are still experiencing problems. But my hope is that just writing this blog post will serve as a guide and reminder of why taking support seriously is worth it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wii Transfer 2.2 is taking longer to get ready than I had planned, so I&#8217;ve decided to post a public beta while the last pieces are polished up. You can &#8220;grab it from the news section&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ of the Riverfold site (lower right). It is very close to being done, but giant chunks of code have been completely rewritten. I hope the extra testing will help make 2.2 an extremely solid release, and get some of the new features in the hands of users as soon as possible.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s new in 2.2? iTunes playlists and several new preferences to control picture sharing top the list, but there are at least a dozen changes underneath the hood.</p>
<p>The web server built into Wii Transfer has seen some work in particular. Music browsing now uses the iTunes Music Library.xml file for everything rather than look at directory contents, and you can change the port number on the fly without restarting Wii Transfer if there is a conflict with any other applications.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also added reflections to the album cover art! You can see a &#8220;screenshot here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/wii_transfer_cover.jpg and another one of &#8220;the collage for playlists here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/wii_transfer_collage.jpg (these are from Safari, but it looks mostly the same on the Wii). This was really fun to do, but unfortunately it somehow introduced a subtle double-release bug that I spent hours fixing. It would only happen if the album art could not be found in iTunes and while multiple connections were hitting the server (i.e. it was ultimately a threading issue), and maybe only every dozen requests.</p>
<p>I tracked it down by using ab (Apache Bench), pointed at Wii Transfer. I had a shell script with a bunch of lines that looked like:</p>
<p><code>ab -n 200 -c 4 "http://localhost:9000/m/Beatles.cover</code></p>
<p>This URL asks Wii Transfer to grab any album art from iTunes for The Beatles, apply the reflection and return the JPEG data. It is flexible because you can send it any search strings. Other examples might be: <code>Evanescence%20Door.cover</code> or <code>Zoo%20Station.cover</code>. I was a little surprised that my little server was actually pumping out pages fairly quickly considering all the AppleScript and Quartz stuff going on. 10-20 requests per second isn&#8217;t much for a real web application, but for an app that is by definition single-user, it&#8217;s perfect.</p>
<p>The reflection code was made even easier by &#8220;BHReflectedImage&#8221;:http://bithaus.com/2006/11/05/nsimage-reflection/, which I modified to work with black backgrounds and then wrapped up in other helper methods to composite the cover and reflection together. When I first ran across this code I didn&#8217;t even notice it was written by Jeff Ganyard, who I&#8217;ve known for years and still run into at WWDC. Thanks Jeff! This goes in the about box credits with a bunch of other mentions. There is a really active Mac developer community that contributes source pretty freely, and I hope to add a few things to that collection one of these day as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a story behind the name &#8220;Riverfold&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/, but it&#8217;s probably not a very good one and I won&#8217;t go on a tangent by telling it here. What I will say is that I hate domain names.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I remember when domain names used to be free (I do), or maybe it&#8217;s because I get some thrill out of typing in IP addresses (I don&#8217;t), or maybe it&#8217;s because I think domains should last forever, like a printed book in wide circulation. But in any case I decided not to register WiiTransfer.com when I first named the product. Five days after announcing and shipping 1.0, someone else registered the domain, for their own presumably evil purposes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve owned just a handful of domains over the years. During the dot-com days I registered MyEdit.com and started building a web-based note filing system (sort of like &#8220;Stikkit&#8221;:http://stikkit.com/, but not as good). Then there were the family web site and related domains.</p>
<p>I let all of them expire, except manton.org. I kept riverfold.com for &#8220;everything else&#8221;, and I&#8217;m pretty comfortable with the simplicity of that decision right now. It was probably foolish to pass up the domain for my own product. But how many people type in photoshop.com to go anywhere? No one who matters.</p>
<p>There is a thread on the MacSB mailing list about the rise of product-oriented web sites (the &#8220;DiscoApp.com&#8221;:http://www.discoapp.com/&#8217;s of this new era of glitzy Mac shareware), and it really made me second-guess my decision to not <em>register everything</em>. But at the end of the day, it&#8217;s one less thing I have to worry about, and I can focus on stuff that is more interesting.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, not really. But this has been a crazy and surprising week for my &#8220;little&#8221; application, Wii Transfer. Putting 8 hours each day into &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ (I have a post coming about that tomorrow, by the way) and then juggling home responsibilities, putting out various other fires, and sitting down to work on Wii Transfer until 3am is just not healthy.</p>
<p>Luckily I slept great last night and took a 3-hour nap today. So time to blog again. :-)</p>
<p>Over a week ago I released Wii Transfer 2.0 and made a big mistake, and since I&#8217;ve been programming for the Mac for over a dozen years now, I really should know better. It was buggy. And not just a few minor cosmetic problems, but at least two serious crashers. I simply had not tested enough. It&#8217;s difficult (sometimes impossible) to regain a user&#8217;s trust after their first experience with an application is a bad one, so I got to work that weekend fixing problems and releasing beta builds to customers to get a few extra eyes on the software.</p>
<p>Then Monday came, and <em>all hell broke loose</em>.</p>
<p>Links from &#8220;Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/january#mon-22-wii_transfer, &#8220;Ranchero&#8221;:http://www.ranchero.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=1523, and &#8220;The Unofficial Apple Weblog&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/01/22/wii-transfer-2-0/ were followed by &#8220;Jostiq&#8221;:http://joystiq.com/2007/01/25/wii-transfer-for-mac-os-turns-your-wii-into-a-media-center-but/, &#8220;Infendo&#8221;:http://infendo.com/2007/01/wii-media-center-software.html, &#8220;4 Color Rebellion&#8221;:http://4colorrebellion.com/archives/2007/01/22/wii-transfer-for-mac-reaches-20/, and a bunch of others. Ironically one of the only gaming sites I read that never linked to Wii Transfer was the only one I had actually sent an announcement to (&#8220;GoNintendo&#8221;:http://www.gonintendo.com/). Traffic and sales were way up (&#8220;here&#8217;s a Mint screenshot&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/images/2007/riverfold_mint.png from one day last week).</p>
<p>But meanwhile, the application was just not that stable. I started rewriting most of the web server inside Wii Transfer and fixing lots of issues with iTunes and iPhoto libraries stored on external drives. Then I made my second mistake: I added a feature (album cover artwork!). Obviously, adding a feature in the middle of bug fixes just delays the original fixes and introduces new problems.</p>
<p>I also quickly realized how many things could go wrong with how music and picture sharing works. It relies on the Nintendo Wii and your Mac being on the same local network. Because Wii Transfer pings a bookmark server to register your IP address, you also have to make sure the app picks the right IP if your Mac is on both ethernet and wireless networks. Worse, many people have the Mac OS X built-in firewall enabled, so users are required to manually open up port 9000.</p>
<p>At one point on Tuesday when sales were coming in, every time I received a PayPal notification email I literally groaned. &#8220;Stop buying this software until I can make it work reliably,&#8221; I would say to the computer. The thing that got me through was that all customers who sent in support email were extremely helpful and patient. The other good news is that with version 2.1.1, it&#8217;s looking pretty solid, and the next update should wrap up any remaining fringe issues.</p>
<p>To everyone who gave Wii Transfer a try, thanks! I think you&#8217;ll like what comes next.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finished &#8220;Wii Transfer 2.0&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ late Thursday night. This version is an interesting milestone for the application because it goes beyond just using the SD card to shuttle data back and forth between your Mac and Wii. There is a small Cocoa web server embedded inside Wii Transfer that can serve up MP3s and JPEGs directly to the Wii using the Internet Channel. I think this could be the basis for some really fun stuff in the future.</p>
<p>One of the things I added at the last minute is to try to simplify how you connect to your Mac from the Wii. IP addresses are difficult to memorize for most people and may change depending on how your home network is setup. To solve this, Wii Transfer will optionally create a permanent URL for you on bookmark.riverfold.com. You can then add that URL as a favorite for your Wii and it will always redirect to your local machine. Wii Transfer will ping the Riverfold server on startup and update the bookmark database with your current IP address. You can think of it as a simplified version of &#8220;Dynamic DNS&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS.</p>
<p>I just noticed that Wii Transfer is the featured download and staff pick in the &#8220;video section of Apple&#8217;s download site&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/video/. That is a nice surprise. It will be interesting to see what that does to download stats.</p>
<p>One last thing. Starting next month the price will go up to $14 for version 2.0 (free upgrade for all existing users). I usually work on Wii Transfer at night, so the increase will help offset all the sleep I lost. :-) Even at $14 it may be underpriced. Remember the &#8220;Brent Simmons rule&#8221;:http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/168/the-price-is-wrong: anything less than $20 won&#8217;t be taken seriously. In this case though I think it&#8217;s just about right. I&#8217;m also finding a large percentage of purchases from Europe, despite no localization, probably because the US dollar is so weak now. Enjoy!</p>
