				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Via Daring Fireball&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/09/12/lanyrd, I&#8217;m loving &#8220;this blog and idea&#8221;:http://sparkabout.net/ from newlyweds Simon Willison and Natalie Downe, who are traveling the world on a working honeymoon:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been in Morocco now for just over a month. We launched Lanyrd from a rented apartment in Casablanca, and we&#8217;re writing this update from a Riad in Marrakech. So far, travelling and working on a startup have complemented each other surprisingly well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1999, Traci and I took a similar but shorter 2-month vacation to Europe where we both worked remotely. This was before wi-fi, so much of the destination planning centered around pay-by-the-hour internet cafes or reliable hotel phone lines for dial-up. Lots of backpacking, cheap rooms, and trains and boats between 6 countries. We were constantly broke and our accommodations varied between the crummy (freezing showers at a hostel) to the beautiful (freezing showers with a Mediterranean view), but those were easily some of the best weeks of my life. At the end of the trip we got engaged and came back to America to get married and have kids and never leave our neighborhood again.</p>
<p>Someday we&#8217;ll go back.</p>
