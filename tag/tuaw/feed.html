				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally released &#8220;Wii Transfer 2.3&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ late last night. This is the version I demoed in &#8220;my interview with The Unofficial Apple Weblog&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/18/video-wii-transfer/. The most notable changes are AAC support, an improved music player interface, and better use of the Wii remote buttons.</p>
<p>This release sports a new icon, designed by Jordan Langille of &#8220;OneToad.com&#8221;:http://www.onetoad.com/. As much as I enjoy tinkering with Photoshop and Illustrator, I knew I didn&#8217;t have time to do a quality icon. I wanted something fun that still captured a part of the original icon, and this concept has really grown on me since it was finished almost 2 months ago.</p>
<p>I also took this opportunity to refresh the &#8220;Riverfold web site&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ design a little. Just don&#8217;t tell anyone that it still uses HTML tables.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2007/moof_beer.jpg" alt="Moof" width="150" height="265" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="6" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /> Along with most of our house, my office is packed up and ready to move this week. The photo to the right is of one of the handful of items in a box labeled &#8220;Manton&#8217;s desk,&#8221; or, if someone else had her way, &#8220;Random junk Manton saves to remember the past but which should really be in the trash can.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unopened Moof beer from WWDC 1996, my first WWDC. At 20 I was too young to drink, but I probably would have saved it anyway. That was back when Apple gave you cool stuff and not just another cheap laptop bag.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s WWDC will probably go down as one of my favorites. The keynote was a bit dull, but it was offset by the reality that Leopard is a mature and usable system. I have been running all my primary apps off of it since last week, including Mail.app, NetNewsWire 3.0, and Xcode.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t place the feeling at the time, but now I realize that last week&#8217;s sessions were, in a way, relaxing. There was no sense of urgency. Most of the sessions I attended were practical, full of hands-on advice for preparing for Leopard and many applicable to Tiger development as well. I got a lot out of the week, and when I decided to skip out on Friday it didn&#8217;t feel like the world would come crashing down because of it.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2007/james_morrison.jpg" alt="James Morrison" width="300" height="226" hspace="8" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" style="border: 1px solid gray;" /> Other highlights of WWDC 2007 were away from the sessions: walking Chinatown with &#8220;Willie&#8221;:http://willie.tumblr.com/ on Sunday in search of the illusive bakery item; hitting the &#8220;SF Mac Indie party&#8221;:http://sfmacindie.com/ that night and hanging out with fellow developers afterwards; Buzz Andersen&#8217;s party Monday, catching up with &#8220;Lane&#8221;:http://www.monstro.com/ and the host; the &#8220;Dan Benjamin&#8221;:http://www.hivelogic.com/ annual breakfast; Apple &#8220;Design Awards&#8221;:http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/ada/ on Tuesday, which had a record number of wins for <em>apps I&#8217;ve actually used</em>; accidentally walking into a James Morrison concert at the Apple Store (left photo); being interviewed by Scott McNulty of &#8220;TUAW&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/, though I secretly hope they will decide not to air it; enjoying great Italian with the &#8220;VitalSource&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ team on Wednesday before catching the tail end of &#8220;CocoaHeads&#8221;:http://theocacao.com/document.page/480; plus the Apple Bash and more drinks and discussion Thursday night.</p>
<p>Like at &#8220;SXSW earlier this year&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/03/twitterconf.html, Twitter proves both cool and useful. I was lucky enough to meet many of the people on my Twitter friends list for the first time last week.</p>
<p>Of course it wasn&#8217;t all fun and games. I sifted through more legitimate Bookshelf bug reports than usual; I was exhausted pretty much every day; and there were a couple developers I had hoped to seek out that I just never made the time to.</p>
<p>All in all, though, a good week and now I&#8217;m ready to get back to coding.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brent Simmons, from a &#8220;TUAW interview&#8221;:http://www.tuaw.com/2007/06/05/5-questions-with-brent-simmons-creator-of-netnewswire/:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;One of the things I love about being a Mac developer is getting to meet the folks who make the apps I use. In a way, my /Applications folder is also my social network. Which is cool.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I never thought about it that way, but it&#8217;s definitely a great aspect of the Mac developer community. I hope to add a few more people to my /Applications social network next week at WWDC.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been to a bunch of WWDCs now, but I&#8217;m particularly excited this year because it will be the first time I&#8217;ve attended as representing both a &#8220;large-ish company&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/ and an &#8220;independent one-man shop&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/.</p>
<p>I will be carrying VitalSource business cards in my wallet, but I also hope to have a printed batch of Wii Transfer serial numbers to hand out. I know a lot of Mac developers have a Nintendo Wii and it&#8217;s a shame I haven&#8217;t given out more copies. If you have a Wii and see me (I look &#8220;something like this&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/me/), please get my attention so that I can correct this oversight.</p>
