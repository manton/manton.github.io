				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/01/release-notes/">Ben Brooks takes on</a> the trend of cute stories inside of release notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With disturbingly increasing frequency, companies are deciding to let their marketing departments handle their release notes instead of the engineering team or product manager.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree. These were fun at first, but the release notes don’t need to be entertainment. They should be a summary of what changed, with bullet points for key changes. (A single “bug fixes” line is also not helpful.)</p>
<p>I personally like to start each line with a clear statement: “Fixed &lt;something&gt;” or “Added &lt;this feature&gt;” or “Improved &lt;something else&gt; by &lt;doing this&gt;”. You can see this in <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/releasenotes/">the history of my Tweet Library release notes</a>, for example.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s start with a quote <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-review/">from the MacStories review</a> by Federico Viticci:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;For developers, it&#8217;s time to be bold with their iOS apps and understand that they can be more than single-purpose utilities. There are millions of people who aren&#8217;t buying PCs anymore because mobile devices are their only computers.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using the iPad Pro a lot in just the last two days. Apps that have taken advantage of the larger screen — and that support iPad multitasking well — are just much more useful. It&#8217;s great to have Slack or Tweetbot in the sidebar and a writing app in the main part of the screen. (Until Editorial is updated, <a href="http://sethclifford.me/2015/11/things-i-like-this-week-volume-15/">like Seth Clifford</a> I&#8217;ve switched to Byword.)</p>
<p>As a developer, going from an iPad Mini to an iPad Pro has opened my eyes to what Federico says above. You simply can&#8217;t have a great iPad app today if it doesn&#8217;t attempt to fit well on the iPad Pro. So although <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/11/winding-down-my-twitter-apps.html">I said</a> I would discontinue my app <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>, I&#8217;ve actually been spending some time this week to <em>update it</em> to support iPad multitasking.</p>
<p>The key to iPad Pro support is actually less about auto layout (although that&#8217;s helpful too), and more about split views and size classes. For a modern app, this is an easy transition. But Tweet Library was written for iOS 4. Back then, UISplitViewController was extremely underpowered. I had used MGSplitViewController instead, which I&#8217;ve modified over the years to adapt to multiple screen sizes from the iPhone to the iPad. So the first step to real iPad multitasking was to rip out most of the split view code and start over with a clean foundation based on iOS 8/9 and UISplitViewController. Not exactly trivial work that I could knock out in a day, although I tried.</p>
<p>I remain very optimistic about the iPad Pro, especially <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/the-incomplete-ipad-pro.html">when the Apple Pencil is actually available</a>. From a business standpoint, it also seems like a better investment in time than either the Apple Watch or Apple TV. There are so many platforms and distractions now. If I can&#8217;t focus on a single platform, I want to at least be proactive in saving some attention for the iPad.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I sent <a href="http://eepurl.com/blcsdv">an email to Watermark customers</a> over the weekend, letting them know that the service as it currently exists will be going away on May 15th. As <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/11/winding-down-my-twitter-apps.html">I wrote about last year</a>, Twitter has improved their search enough that a part of what Watermark is good at is no longer as necessary as it once was. However, I still see interest in Tweet Marker, from developers and users, so I wanted to keep the web-based timeline and sync from Watermark and make it available to all Tweet Marker subscribers.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">learn more about Tweet Marker here</a>. I’ve had to significantly scale out the backend servers this year, including adding a second load balancer, so I’d love your support. The new timeline feature will roll out later in May.</p>
<p>While I’m happy to keep offering a part of Watermark (now back in Tweet Marker), I have less good news for Tweet Library. I’ve found it very difficult to justify the time to finish the new version. It’s now looking likely that the current version will be the last.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last year I wrote that <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/11/winding-down-my-twitter-apps.html">I would be removing Tweet Library from the App Store</a> at the end of December, and later said on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/01/episode-168-motorola-68k-forever/">Core Int</a> and in <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetlibrary/status/536910542288338945">a tweet</a> that there would be one last update before the app is gone. It&#8217;s well into January and the old version is still for sale. I&#8217;m over a month behind schedule but still plan to release the updated version and stop selling the app.</p>
<p>On the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/88-theyre-still-your-babies/">latest Release Notes podcast</a> there was a great discussion about when to give up on an app that isn&#8217;t making money, including a mention of my plan with Tweet Library. Joe and Charles talked about why it&#8217;s usually such a bad idea to promise features before you ship, and whether there&#8217;s an obligation to give customers any updates at all.</p>
<p>I pretty much agree with everything they said, but the upcoming Tweet Library 2.7 &#8220;features&#8221; are different. My goal with this release is for the app to be functional and stable for as long possible. I think the app needs better syncing of tweet collections to help future-proof it, to make it easier for customers to move between iOS devices when they upgrade their iPhone or iPad a year from now. For an app that is going away, I should do everything I can to make sure that a customer&#8217;s data is accessible and that import and export are as robust as possible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a reasonable question to ask why I would spend so much time working on something that will essentially bring in no additional revenue. But while it won&#8217;t directly make any money, it probably helped convince some new customers to buy the app over the last month, and it will very likely reduce the support burden for the app over the following year.</p>
<p>I also view it as a sort of parting &#8220;thank you&#8221; to my customers. It&#8217;s just the right thing to do to wrap up the app. <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/the-future-of-unison/">Panic did the same thing</a> when they stopped selling Unison, releasing a major free update at the same time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in picking up a copy of Tweet Library before it&#8217;s too late, you can <a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">buy it on the App Store for $4.99</a>. The new version should ship in early February.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m the guest on <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2014/11/23/226-workflows-with-manton-reece/">this week&#8217;s Mac Power Users podcast</a>. In addition to workflow and apps I use, the discussion went off the rails a little into the Twitter app ecosystem, especially the fact that I no longer post to Twitter yet still have apps like Tweet Library, Watermark, and the Tweet Marker API that depend on Twitter. For the last 2 years this has been an odd decision on my part; I want to do the right thing for my customers, but I&#8217;m increasingly frustrated with life as a third-party Twitter developer.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/building-a-complete-tweet-index">Twitter announced</a> that they&#8217;ve expanded their search index to include the full history of tweets going back to 2006. I was thrilled by this upgrade to the Twitter service. That the search was so limited for so long was the primary reason I built Tweet Library and Watermark to begin with. Unfortunately, this functionality is only for the official Twitter apps. <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/search-api-the-new-complete-tweet-index-announcement/27883">It will not be made available</a> to third-party developers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for me to wind down development on my Twitter-related apps. I&#8217;ll continue to sell Tweet Library through the end of 2014, then remove it from the App Store. Watermark will also shut down at that time. Because all the tweets stored in Watermark are public tweets (by design it never supported DMs or protected accounts), I will attempt to make the entire Watermark database archive of millions of tweets available publicly. Existing customers can also sync tweets and collections to Dropbox for personal archiving.</p>
<p>Published collections from Tweet Library or Watermark will be maintained indefinitely. No URLs will break, ever. Updating published collections will also continue to work for anyone who already owns Tweet Library.</p>
<p>I will also continue to host the Tweet Marker API, but starting in January I will be more strict about requiring developers to pay for the service. Many developers have been paying for API access for a year (thank you!), but others have missed or ignored my requests to move to a paid plan. It&#8217;s not fair to the Twitter developers who have been paying for Tweet Marker access if some continue get the API for free.</p>
<p>Many friends have told me over the years that I have <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">too many products</a>. But letting any one product go is not easy. There&#8217;s an implicit promise when shipping software that the developer should maintain and improve it for customers. Stopping development on these apps is the right decision and possibly long overdue, but it&#8217;s still difficult. What gives me hope is that it will let me focus on new projects currently in development, which I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about.</p>

This release adds support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen sizes, as well as improvements to sharing so that iOS 8 extensions can be used, and a fix for an annoying random crashing bug.</p>
<p>I also finally dropped iOS 5 and 6 support for this release. I wanted to support the iPad 1 as long as possible because those were my very first customers when I launched Tweet Library 1.0 almost exactly 4 years ago. I hope they got an incredible value out of the app in that time (all upgrades have been free). It feels good to turn a corner and require iOS 7.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m now convinced that Apple will have something like a 6C next year to maintain the 4-inch design. It will never have the best camera or longest battery life — that will be reserved for the larger phones — but there will be 3 fully supported sizes with some core modern features like Touch ID and Apple Pay.</p>
<p>We also talk about updating your app for the new screen sizes and iOS 8. My update to Tweet Library is still waiting for review, but hopefully will be approved soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, in <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/04/write_locally_mirror.html">my post about mirroring content</a>, I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “When we get into the groove of using a new service for a few years, it’s easy to forget that web sites don’t have a very good track record.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we find out that <a href="http://mlkshk.typepad.com/mlkshk/2014/04/goodbye.html">Mlkshk is shutting down</a>. They are working <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/463436494364213249">with the Internet Archive</a> to make sure the content is preserved, and they might still find a buyer for the whole service, but as things stand it’s likely that every link to Mlkshk-hosted images will break in September.</p>
<p>Mlkshk hasn’t been on my radar lately, but it was widely used enough a couple years ago that I added support for its image thumbnails to <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>. I hope they can at least find a solution to keep mlkshk.com working as a static site.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was talking to friends this week about app advertising, and it inspired me to try Twitter ads. Otherwise known as “promoted tweets”, these ads are actual tweets that show up in search results and timelines, even if the user isn’t following your account. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/04/tweet_library_25.html">Tweet Library 2.5</a> seemed like the perfect time to try this.</p>
<p>I set a max of $5 a day and included several related Twitter accounts to help the ads find a more narrow audience of people who might want to buy Tweet Library. Here are the results after 24 hours:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2014/promoted_tweets_dashboard.png" width="600" height="367" alt="Promoted tweets dashboard" border="0" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t have an easy way to track this all the way to actual App Store sales. Assuming a 5% conversion on App Store visits, I likely lost a little money. The extra 1800 impressions is nice though, to raise awareness about the app. I’m going to let it run for a week.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a new update to <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> out today. Major additions include CSV file export to Dropbox and new URL schemes for starting a search, export, or publish. The URL schemes look like this:</p>
<p>twtlib://username/search?q=hello&amp;collection=Favorites</p>
<p>twtlib://username/export?collection=Testing</p>
<p>twtlib://username/publish?collection=Testing</p>
<p>twtlib://username/storify?collection=Testing</p>
<p>There are a few other important bug fixes too, especially to importing the Tweets.zip archive from Twitter.</p>
<p>When I gave up on Twitter as a user, many people asked if I would abandon Tweet Library. I wasn&#8217;t sure at first, but the answer now is a clear &#8220;no&#8221;. In fact, since my last personal tweet in 2012, I&#8217;ve released new features and even redesigned the app for iOS 7.</p>
<p>But I do need to start consolidating my work on Tweet Library and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>, because the apps share so many concepts around archiving and search. To that end, this week I&#8217;m retiring tweetlibrary.com as a way to browse and publish collections. The site will now redirect to a special landing page on Watermark. Published collections from Tweet Library also go to a public page on Watermark.</p>
<p>It was a tough decision to change the tweetlibrary.com URLs, but maintaining separate web apps that are so similar made everything more complicated, holding back what I could build. Having a single web codebase (Watermark) will ultimately let me improve both Tweet Library and Watermark more quickly.</p>
