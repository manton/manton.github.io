				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Let&#8217;s start with a quote <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-review/">from the MacStories review</a> by Federico Viticci:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;For developers, it&#8217;s time to be bold with their iOS apps and understand that they can be more than single-purpose utilities. There are millions of people who aren&#8217;t buying PCs anymore because mobile devices are their only computers.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using the iPad Pro a lot in just the last two days. Apps that have taken advantage of the larger screen — and that support iPad multitasking well — are just much more useful. It&#8217;s great to have Slack or Tweetbot in the sidebar and a writing app in the main part of the screen. (Until Editorial is updated, <a href="http://sethclifford.me/2015/11/things-i-like-this-week-volume-15/">like Seth Clifford</a> I&#8217;ve switched to Byword.)</p>
<p>As a developer, going from an iPad Mini to an iPad Pro has opened my eyes to what Federico says above. You simply can&#8217;t have a great iPad app today if it doesn&#8217;t attempt to fit well on the iPad Pro. So although <a href="../../2014/11/winding-down-my-twitter-apps.html">I said</a> I would discontinue my app <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>, I&#8217;ve actually been spending some time this week to <em>update it</em> to support iPad multitasking.</p>
<p>The key to iPad Pro support is actually less about auto layout (although that&#8217;s helpful too), and more about split views and size classes. For a modern app, this is an easy transition. But Tweet Library was written for iOS 4. Back then, UISplitViewController was extremely underpowered. I had used MGSplitViewController instead, which I&#8217;ve modified over the years to adapt to multiple screen sizes from the iPhone to the iPad. So the first step to real iPad multitasking was to rip out most of the split view code and start over with a clean foundation based on iOS 8/9 and UISplitViewController. Not exactly trivial work that I could knock out in a day, although I tried.</p>
<p>I remain very optimistic about the iPad Pro, especially <a href="../../2015/11/the-incomplete-ipad-pro.html">when the Apple Pencil is actually available</a>. From a business standpoint, it also seems like a better investment in time than either the Apple Watch or Apple TV. There are so many platforms and distractions now. If I can&#8217;t focus on a single platform, I want to at least be proactive in saving some attention for the iPad.</p>

			<p>I sent <a href="http://eepurl.com/blcsdv">an email to Watermark customers</a> over the weekend, letting them know that the service as it currently exists will be going away on May 15th. As <a href="../../2014/11/winding-down-my-twitter-apps.html">I wrote about last year</a>, Twitter has improved their search enough that a part of what Watermark is good at is no longer as necessary as it once was. However, I still see interest in Tweet Marker, from developers and users, so I wanted to keep the web-based timeline and sync from Watermark and make it available to all Tweet Marker subscribers.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">learn more about Tweet Marker here</a>. I’ve had to significantly scale out the backend servers this year, including adding a second load balancer, so I’d love your support. The new timeline feature will roll out later in May.</p>
<p>While I’m happy to keep offering a part of Watermark (now back in Tweet Marker), I have less good news for Tweet Library. I’ve found it very difficult to justify the time to finish the new version. It’s now looking likely that the current version will be the last.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last year I wrote that <a href="../../2014/11/winding-down-my-twitter-apps.html">I would be removing Tweet Library from the App Store</a> at the end of December, and later said on <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/01/episode-168-motorola-68k-forever/">Core Int</a> and in <a href="https://twitter.com/tweetlibrary/status/536910542288338945">a tweet</a> that there would be one last update before the app is gone. It&#8217;s well into January and the old version is still for sale. I&#8217;m over a month behind schedule but still plan to release the updated version and stop selling the app.</p>
<p>On the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/88-theyre-still-your-babies/">latest Release Notes podcast</a> there was a great discussion about when to give up on an app that isn&#8217;t making money, including a mention of my plan with Tweet Library. Joe and Charles talked about why it&#8217;s usually such a bad idea to promise features before you ship, and whether there&#8217;s an obligation to give customers any updates at all.</p>
<p>I pretty much agree with everything they said, but the upcoming Tweet Library 2.7 &#8220;features&#8221; are different. My goal with this release is for the app to be functional and stable for as long possible. I think the app needs better syncing of tweet collections to help future-proof it, to make it easier for customers to move between iOS devices when they upgrade their iPhone or iPad a year from now. For an app that is going away, I should do everything I can to make sure that a customer&#8217;s data is accessible and that import and export are as robust as possible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a reasonable question to ask why I would spend so much time working on something that will essentially bring in no additional revenue. But while it won&#8217;t directly make any money, it probably helped convince some new customers to buy the app over the last month, and it will very likely reduce the support burden for the app over the following year.</p>
<p>I also view it as a sort of parting &#8220;thank you&#8221; to my customers. It&#8217;s just the right thing to do to wrap up the app. <a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/the-future-of-unison/">Panic did the same thing</a> when they stopped selling Unison, releasing a major free update at the same time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in picking up a copy of Tweet Library before it&#8217;s too late, you can <a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">buy it on the App Store for $4.99</a>. The new version should ship in early February.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;m the guest on <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2014/11/23/226-workflows-with-manton-reece/">this week&#8217;s Mac Power Users podcast</a>. In addition to workflow and apps I use, the discussion went off the rails a little into the Twitter app ecosystem, especially the fact that I no longer post to Twitter yet still have apps like Tweet Library, Watermark, and the Tweet Marker API that depend on Twitter. For the last 2 years this has been an odd decision on my part; I want to do the right thing for my customers, but I&#8217;m increasingly frustrated with life as a third-party Twitter developer.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/building-a-complete-tweet-index">Twitter announced</a> that they&#8217;ve expanded their search index to include the full history of tweets going back to 2006. I was thrilled by this upgrade to the Twitter service. That the search was so limited for so long was the primary reason I built Tweet Library and Watermark to begin with. Unfortunately, this functionality is only for the official Twitter apps. <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/search-api-the-new-complete-tweet-index-announcement/27883">It will not be made available</a> to third-party developers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for me to wind down development on my Twitter-related apps. I&#8217;ll continue to sell Tweet Library through the end of 2014, then remove it from the App Store. Watermark will also shut down at that time. Because all the tweets stored in Watermark are public tweets (by design it never supported DMs or protected accounts), I will attempt to make the entire Watermark database archive of millions of tweets available publicly. Existing customers can also sync tweets and collections to Dropbox for personal archiving.</p>
<p>Published collections from Tweet Library or Watermark will be maintained indefinitely. No URLs will break, ever. Updating published collections will also continue to work for anyone who already owns Tweet Library.</p>
<p>I will also continue to host the Tweet Marker API, but starting in January I will be more strict about requiring developers to pay for the service. Many developers have been paying for API access for a year (thank you!), but others have missed or ignored my requests to move to a paid plan. It&#8217;s not fair to the Twitter developers who have been paying for Tweet Marker access if some continue get the API for free.</p>
<p>Many friends have told me over the years that I have <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">too many products</a>. But letting any one product go is not easy. There&#8217;s an implicit promise when shipping software that the developer should maintain and improve it for customers. Stopping development on these apps is the right decision and possibly long overdue, but it&#8217;s still difficult. What gives me hope is that it will let me focus on new projects currently in development, which I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about.</p>

			<p><a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">Tweet Library 2.6</a> shipped today after 13 days waiting for review from Apple. This release adds support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen sizes, as well as improvements to sharing so that iOS 8 extensions can be used, and a fix for an annoying random crashing bug.</p>
<p>I also finally dropped iOS 5 and 6 support for this release. I wanted to support the iPad 1 as long as possible because those were my very first customers when I launched Tweet Library 1.0 almost exactly 4 years ago. I hope they got an incredible value out of the app in that time (all upgrades have been free). It feels good to turn a corner and require iOS 7.</p>

			<p>Last week, in <a href="../../2014/04/write_locally_mirror.html">my post about mirroring content</a>, I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “When we get into the groove of using a new service for a few years, it’s easy to forget that web sites don’t have a very good track record.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we find out that <a href="http://mlkshk.typepad.com/mlkshk/2014/04/goodbye.html">Mlkshk is shutting down</a>. They are working <a href="https://twitter.com/textfiles/status/463436494364213249">with the Internet Archive</a> to make sure the content is preserved, and they might still find a buyer for the whole service, but as things stand it’s likely that every link to Mlkshk-hosted images will break in September.</p>
<p>Mlkshk hasn’t been on my radar lately, but it was widely used enough a couple years ago that I added support for its image thumbnails to <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>. I hope they can at least find a solution to keep mlkshk.com working as a static site.</p>

			<p>I was talking to friends this week about app advertising, and it inspired me to try Twitter ads. Otherwise known as “promoted tweets”, these ads are actual tweets that show up in search results and timelines, even if the user isn’t following your account. <a href="../../2014/04/tweet_library_25.html">Tweet Library 2.5</a> seemed like the perfect time to try this.</p>
<p>I set a max of $5 a day and included several related Twitter accounts to help the ads find a more narrow audience of people who might want to buy Tweet Library. Here are the results after 24 hours:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/2014/promoted_tweets_dashboard.png" width="600" height="367" alt="Promoted tweets dashboard" border="0" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t have an easy way to track this all the way to actual App Store sales. Assuming a 5% conversion on App Store visits, I likely lost a little money. The extra 1800 impressions is nice though, to raise awareness about the app. I’m going to let it run for a week.</p>

			<p>There&#8217;s a new update to <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> out today. Major additions include CSV file export to Dropbox and new URL schemes for starting a search, export, or publish. The URL schemes look like this:</p>
<p>twtlib://username/search?q=hello&amp;collection=Favorites</p>
<p>twtlib://username/export?collection=Testing</p>
<p>twtlib://username/publish?collection=Testing</p>
<p>twtlib://username/storify?collection=Testing</p>
<p>There are a few other important bug fixes too, especially to importing the Tweets.zip archive from Twitter.</p>
<p>When I gave up on Twitter as a user, many people asked if I would abandon Tweet Library. I wasn&#8217;t sure at first, but the answer now is a clear &#8220;no&#8221;. In fact, since my last personal tweet in 2012, I&#8217;ve released new features and even redesigned the app for iOS 7.</p>
<p>But I do need to start consolidating my work on Tweet Library and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>, because the apps share so many concepts around archiving and search. To that end, this week I&#8217;m retiring tweetlibrary.com as a way to browse and publish collections. The site will now redirect to a special landing page on Watermark. Published collections from Tweet Library also go to a public page on Watermark.</p>
<p>It was a tough decision to change the tweetlibrary.com URLs, but maintaining separate web apps that are so similar made everything more complicated, holding back what I could build. Having a single web codebase (Watermark) will ultimately let me improve both Tweet Library and Watermark more quickly.</p>

<p>I’m pretty happy with how this release turned out, but there’s still more work to do. I’ll be following up this release with some additional improvements specifically for iOS 7 soon.

I’m pretty happy with this version. In addition to finally switching to Twitter’s v1.1 API — easier said than done; I used several API calls that were changed or completely went away — this release added better gestures, a month filter to the iPhone version, and an updated UI with a lighter, clearer design.</p>

Daniel and I discussed the expedited review process and new versions. Tweet Library 2.3 is available <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/tweet-library/id365768793?mt=8">in the App Store for $7.99</a> as a universal app for both iPhone and iPad.</p>

			<p>My apps <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a> and <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker</a> were recently updated to version 1.1 of Twitter’s API.

<p>I don’t like having my release schedule dictated by others, but that’s life as a Twitter developer. And why I no longer post there.</p>
<p>This matters today because Twitter is running an API <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/api-v1-retirement-update">blackout test</a>. Tweet Library will not be able to load new tweets this afternoon for about an hour (3pm PST) while v1 is unavailable. I’ll post again here and from <a href="https://alpha.app.net/riverfold">@riverfold on App.net</a> when the new version of Tweet Library is shipped off to Apple and live in the App Store.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I tend to be pretty stubborn about not changing my price. <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> sat at $10 for two years before I finally lowered it, and the price for <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart</a> has never changed from the $29 it shipped at. I think there is something to be said for price consistency so that users feel like software is stable and doesn’t have arbitrary value. (Many people disagree with this, which is why I’d classify my opinion as equal parts instinct and stubbornness rather than a proven formula for success.)</p>
<p>But I’m making two pricing changes today: Tweet Library goes up to $7.99, and Watermark down to just $4/month. I’ve come to believe that the previous price changes for both products were too far in either direction. I hope this corrects that. In the case of Watermark, I will eventually be offering different plans at higher tiers for more storage, and want the entry-level price to be as appealing as possible. (All existing Watermark customers have been switched to the discounted plan.)</p>
<p>The little <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/watermark-mobile/id566886320?mt=8">iOS app for Watermark</a> has also been updated to version 1.1 and now features auto-renewing subscriptions. This means you can sign up directly in the iOS app and have your iTunes account charged each month. Watermark Mobile launched mostly as a convenient search interface, but it should now start receiving more regular updates.</p>

								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>It’s great to see more people get access to their full archive of tweets from Twitter. In addition to just having a copy of your own tweets, it can be useful to go back and browse them by date, or search for something specific. I’d suggest putting the HTML version online as-is (<a href="../../archive/tweets/index.html">mine’s here</a>), and also checking out other apps that add a variety of different features on top of the basic archive.</p>
<p>Both of my apps — <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> for iOS and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a> for the web — can now import the .zip file you receive from Twitter. This file contains your full archive of tweets and retweets. Both apps can load the file directly from Dropbox, making it as simple as possible to get the tweets imported. And both apps are smart about only importing tweets that haven’t been stored yet, so you don’t have to worry about duplicates.</p>
<p><strong>To import into Tweet Library</strong>, first download the archive from your settings page on twitter.com. Inside Tweet Library click on the blue arrow icon next to “Archives” and walk through the steps to authorize your account with Dropbox. Then copy the .zip file from Twitter to Dropbox → Apps → Tweet Library. It will show up in Tweet Library and can be selected.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/2013/tl_import_flow.png" alt="Tweet Library import flow" border="0" width="540" height="226" /></p>
<p>Tweet Library is good if you want easy access to your tweets on the iPhone or iPad. You can search your tweets, create filters for them, and add tweets to special collections to share with others. It also doubles as a full Twitter client, with a timeline, posting, Instapaper support, and plenty more. Check it out <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweet-library/id365768793?mt=8">in the iOS App Store</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To import into Watermark</strong>, also download the archive from Twitter and put it on Dropbox. You can put it anywhere, either in Apps → Watermark if you’ve already authorized Watermark to use Dropbox (for export), or in Documents or anywhere else. Then sign in to Watermark and click Account → “Upload all your tweets” to select the file.</p>
<p>Watermark is good if you want to expand your archive beyond just your own tweets. It indexes tweets from everyone you are following, creating a huge searchable archive over time. My own account in Watermark now has about 400,000 tweets indexed. Sign up or <a href="http://watermark.io/">learn more at watermark.io</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="../../2012/11/tweet_library_price.html">I posted a couple months ago</a> about my experiment to cut the price of Tweet Library in half. I’ve decided to make this decision permanent. Tweet Library is just $4.99 as a universal app for both iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>Today I’m also releasing Tweet Library 2.2. This version gains a few improvements and bug fixes, but most importantly a big new feature: support for importing Twitter’s new archive format. It does this by downloading the .zip file you receive from Twitter directly via Dropbox, to make it easy to import your full archive of tweets. (Watermark <a href="http://longposts.com/2143060">has this feature too</a>.)</p>
<p>Not everyone has access to exporting their tweets from Twitter yet, but I wanted to get this feature out as soon as possible. And I already have a version 2.2.1 submitted to Apple with more improvements to the import process.</p>

			<p><a href="../../2012/10/tweet_library_price.html">Last month I tried an experiment</a>, lowering the price of <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> for the first time in 2 years. It wasn’t selling well and I wanted to do something to determine if I was just stubbornly pricing it too high or if there was a deeper issue with the quality or marketing of the app. So let’s follow up on whether this was a success or not.</p>
<p>Here’s the graph of revenue for a 2-month period: one month before the price cut and one month after. There was also a new version released about a week after the price cut, but it didn’t appear to have a significant impact on sales.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/2012/tweetlibrary_pricecut.png" alt="Tweet Library price cut" border="0" width="500" height="182" /></p>
<p>Downloads were up 175%. Profit was up 40%. My gut feeling is that I should have dropped the price to $7.99 instead of $4.99, but I’m wary of changing anything again right now. We’ll see what next month looks like.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>At Çingleton last week, Michael Jurewitz talked about app pricing and the arguments for raising your price. He made a convincing case, and it echoed some of the themes that <a href="../../2010/06/10_ipad_apps.html">I wrote about before I released Tweet Library 1.0</a> back in 2010.</p>
<p>In the two years since, I never once changed the price. No intro discount, no gimmicks, never on sale; $10 was essentially set stone. Even as it moved to the iPhone as a universal app, I stuck to my original philosophy about pricing, perhaps stubbornly. There’s value in consistent pricing, so that the user knows what to expect from one month to the next, and to indicate that the developer attaches a specific value to the app.</p>
<p>Last week, before Çingleton and right as version 2.1 of Tweet Library was about to be released, I decided to try an experiment: I cut the price in half to $4.99. Even though it’s a niche app that only doubles as a full Twitter client, this puts it more in line with other Twitter apps on iOS. (And even cheaper than buying both the iPhone and iPad versions of some apps, like Netbot for ADN.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tweetbot for Mac is now out at $20. <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2012/10/18/fairly-priced/">Daniel Jalkut covers this</a> on his new blog, Bitsplitting:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Is $20 a reasonable amount to pay for Tweetbot? I think so. But if Tapbots would have preferred to charge even less, has it been fairly priced? Many folks are seizing on the coincidence of Tapbots <em>needing to charge more</em> as an opportunity to exalt ‘fair pricing,’ when this was a result of coercion in two directions.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Pricing is something I am still very fascinated by, especially this constant pull between how we value our own software and how pragmatic we want to be as a business. I’m going to let Tweet Library sit at $4.99 for a month, and if revenue is not obviously greater than what it would have been, I’ll bump it back to $10 or a middle-ground $7.99.</p>

			<p>With every day since <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api">Twitter’s new rules</a> were announced, my opinion grows stronger that this is the end of the platform as we’ve known it for the last few years. It hurts that <a href="http://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/">so much of what was pioneered by the developer community</a> has been co-opted and trademarked and turned against developers. Nothing will change tomorrow; we can expect new versions of Tweetbot, Twitterrific, and my own app Tweet Library. But in the long run it’s a dead-end.</p>
<p>Lex Friedman, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1168222/twitter_app_makers_trying_to_figure_out_the_future.html">writing for Macworld</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Some developers are notably hesitant to speak on the record, lest they incur Twitter’s wrath; the fear seems to be that since Twitter is now exerting more control than ever over access to its API—which developers leverage to make their Twitter apps work—that irking Twitter too much might result in a developer’s API access getting revoked.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I have less at stake than developers with popular mainstream apps, so in a way I feel it’s my duty to speak out when it’s warranted, where others can’t. I’m quoted in <a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/08/21/twitter-secured/">Matthew Panzarino’s article</a> on the Twitter API change, and I was <a href="http://www.kqed.org/news/story/2012/08/20/105989/new_twitter_rules_restrict_app_development_sales?category=bay+area">interviewed for a radio spot on San Francisco’s KQED</a>.</p>
<p>I could live with some of the API changes. I could live with the display requirements, even the user caps. Maybe I could live in a developer-hostile environment, finding a market niche far below Twitter’s radar. Except for two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>“Timeline integrity”</strong>: The display guidelines say you can’t mix other content in a timeline of tweets. You can’t easily have a multi-platform app that shows both App.net posts and Twitter tweets in the same view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trademarks</strong>: You are allowed to use “Tweet” in the name of your app, but only if Twitter is the only service you support. You can’t add Facebook or App.net or Heello support alongside Twitter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are anti-competitive and unworkable. So I’ve decided to spin off Tweet Marker Plus, my paid web-based app that builds on top of the Tweet Marker sync engine. I’ll relaunch it with a new name, slowly introducing new features that aren’t tied exclusively to Twitter. For a hint of where it’s going, you can <a href="https://alpha.app.net/manton">follow me on App.net</a>.</p>

			<p>You may not notice it right away, but Tweet Marker Plus is the start of a big migration for my Twitter projects. The backend infrastructure for <a href="http://tweetlibrary.com/">tweetlibrary.com</a> will be moving there, so that Tweet Marker can have access to published collections. And a major web feature to complement Tweet Library — originally written for tweetlibrary.com last year but never released — will be launching on Tweet Marker Plus instead.</p>
<p>Essentially, Tweet Marker will be the web app and web services. Tweet Library will be the native iOS client only.</p>
<p>This has a few pretty big advantages for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>One web app to manage instead of two.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other Twitter apps can access the collections publishing API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tweet Marker is a better brand than Tweet Library.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More people know about Tweet Marker. It just makes sense to build any new web features on top of that existing name.</p>
<p>The first step in this transition is ready now: published collections can be accessed via tweetmarker.net. For example, see <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/collections/shauninman/millinaut">this collection of tweets from the game Millinaut</a> by Shaun Inman, Neven Mrgan, and Alex Ogle.</p>

			<p>Five years ago today, I joined Twitter as its 897th user, though for some reason &#8220;my first tweet&#8221;:http://twitter.com/manton/statuses/1457463 wasn&#8217;t until a few months later. So much has changed in the meantime &mdash; the API always in flux, the transition from primarily SMS, to web, to apps &mdash; but in many ways the core of the service remains intact and stronger than ever. Short messages, distributed efficiently to friends.</p>
<p>I talked about some of the good and bad of being a Twitter developer &#8220;on the ATX Web Show last week&#8221;:http://atxwebshow.com/2011/07/05/episode-34-tweet-library-with-manton/. There have been a string of changes that cause developers to scramble: turning off basic auth, discouraging mainstream clients, disabling DMs for xAuth. With each step, Twitter loses a little goodwill, and that&#8217;s demonstrated in the tweets I &#8220;collected over the xAuth change&#8221;:http://tweetlibrary.com/manton/xauthtooauth.</p>
<p>Even as Twitter passes 1 million registered apps, there&#8217;s a risk that some developers will stick with the platform as users only, putting their apps in maintenance mode. In May, &#8220;Kiwi developer Isaiah stopped development&#8221;:http://yourhead.tumblr.com/post/5550105265/i-love-you-kiwi-i-know of his Mac Twitter app:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just going to take a break from Kiwi for a while. It&#8217;s still for sale. I still support it. I&#8217;ll still fix bugs when they crop up. But adding new features and playing catch up with the other guys/gals is off the table.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe because I don&#8217;t have to depend on Tweet Library sales, I tend to more stubbornly ignore what is good business sense. There&#8217;s so much I still want to do. As &#8220;I wrote in my previous take&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2011/03/twitters.html on the state of the platform: &#8220;I&#8217;m a little discouraged, but not enough to stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that&#8217;s doubly true today. More annoyed, but also more determined to plug holes in the platform, from archiving to syncing. I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about the developers who are building in &#8220;Tweet Marker&#8221;:http://tweetmarker.net/ support.</p>
<p>And there&#8217;s always a chance, a feeling that something big is just around the corner. That if I don&#8217;t add that one feature, or open up that new API, I&#8217;ll miss the tipping point that makes Tweet Library really take off.</p>
