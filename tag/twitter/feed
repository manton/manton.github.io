				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/twitter-market/">an essay about Twitter written in 2014</a>, Ben Thompson described why he believed in the service:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I think this actually gets to the problem with Twitter: the initial concept was <em>so good</em>, and so perfectly fit such a large market, that they never needed to go through the process of achieving product market fit. It just happened, and they’ve been riding that match for going on eight years.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve always thought the same thing. That Twitter started out so good, with such strong core features, that those basic features have carried it through all the years of missteps and inaction. But it&#8217;s not just that the features are &#8220;good&#8221; (although they are); it&#8217;s that they are <em>unique</em>.</p>
<p>Listening to the <a href="http://www.relay.fm/connected/64">Connected podcast</a> the other day, Federico Viticci and Myke Hurley made the statement that only nerds care about Twitter changing stars to hearts, favorites to likes. I was nodding in agreement until I talked to my daughter. She also didn&#8217;t understand why they would change away from stars, and she&#8217;s been on Twitter less than a year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just nerds. Many new Twitter users recognize the subtle difference implied with hearts. But I realized that there&#8217;s something even more important about what this change says. Why is my daughter even on Twitter, in addition to Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and Vine? Because — even if most people can&#8217;t pin down exactly what makes it special — everyone knows Twitter is different and interesting.</p>
<p>All Twitter has going for it is its uniqueness. The timeline user experience, the retweets and favorites, the hashtag, and the short 140 character posts. Changing any of those key strengths to be just like every other social network means they&#8217;re watering down their own potential impact. Eventually that approach will produce a bland product that has no unique qualities.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already seen the timeline experience significantly altered. Promoted tweets, &#8220;while you were away&#8221;, inline conversation threads, and Twitter cards. Twitter in 2015 looks a lot more like Facebook than it did a few years ago, to everyone not using third-party Twitter apps.</p>
<p>Growing the user base is fine. But making Twitter more accessible to new users won&#8217;t do any good if you lose the much larger base of passionate users who have loved the product for years <em>because it&#8217;s unique</em>. You&#8217;re not going to beat Facebook by becoming even more like Facebook. If that&#8217;s Twitter&#8217;s strategy, then the service is already in decline.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/manton/status/254228056657494016">Three years ago today</a> I posted my last personal tweet. That time and distance away from mainstream social networking has given me a new perspective on the importance of independent microblogging. It has shaped <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">where I write</a> and what tools I build.</p>
<p>But Twitter remains as fascinating as ever. Just a few weeks ago, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/11891887/adam-bain-interview-twitter-jack-dorsey.html">the board seemed unsure</a> about letting Jack Dorsey split his time between Twitter and Square:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The responsibilities of running Square, which Dorsey reportedly refuses to give up, may now stand in the way of a Steve <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/steve-jobs/">Jobs-esque</a> return as Twitter’s full time chief executive. In June, its board took the unusual step of publicly declaring that it would only consider candidates &#8216;who are in a position to make a full-time commitment to Twitter&#8217;, a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/11691834/Jack-Dorsey-will-have-to-quit-as-Square-boss-to-take-charge-of-Twitter.html">thinly-veiled reference to Dorsey’s preoccupations</a>.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Then they <a href="http://recode.net/2015/09/30/sources-jack-dorsey-to-be-named-permanent-twitter-ceo/">backed away from that</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;That declaration, as it seems to have turned out, has been a largely empty one. The idea that Dorsey might return gained steam among people both inside and outside the company over the past few months even though he had no intention of leaving Square. He even referred to the companies as his two children when discussing the dilemma, according to a source.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Today they officially announced that Jack will return to lead Twitter. Of all the recent articles, my favorite <a href="http://recode.net/2015/10/02/why-jack-dorsey-is-ready-to-save-twitter/">is this one from Recode</a>, a long profile on Jack&#8217;s role and changing attitude:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;He seems to be a completely different man than the one who returned to Twitter in March 2011 as executive chairman and product czar. Former colleagues recall a man looking for payback for his 2008 ouster; loyalty was key, and many who were loyal to Twitter’s other co-founder, Ev Williams, were booted from the company. Back then, Dorsey would routinely sit in on meetings without saying a word. When he did speak, his contributions were so abstract that few understood what he was talking about. In some cases, he’d simply write a single word or two up on the whiteboard.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>And it goes on, showing how Jack has matured as a leader. Everyone will be watching what he does, and how Twitter evolves. Every article written about an upcoming Twitter feature will mention Jack&#8217;s involvement, no matter how insignificant. He&#8217;s a big part of the story now.</p>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@ev/why-i-m-glad-jack-is-back-at-twitter-9bbda2ae5dca">Ev also wrote</a> about the official announcement:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Twitter is bigger and more important to the world than we ever dreamed when we started. And it still has incredible, unrealized potential. It will not be easy to unlock it. But we have thousands of smart, creative people working every day to make the company great. And Jack has already demonstrated the ability to inspire the team and think boldly about the next phase of Twitter.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The greatest challenge for Jack will be figuring out how to take whatever those thousands of employees are working on and turn it into actual user-facing features that ship to customers. Federico Viticci, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-4-review-bigger-bot/">reviewing the new Tweetbot 4 release</a> last week, wrote about how Tapbots has built something more ambitious than the official Twitter for iPad app, even though Twitter has a much bigger team:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;On the other hand, Twitter for iPad – long ignored by the company – has emerged again <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/twitter-aims-to-unify-ios-apps-updates-its-ipad-app/">with a stretched-up iPhone layout</a> presented in the name of &#8216;consistency&#8217;. It&#8217;s a grim landscape, devoid of the excitement and curiosity that surrounded Twitter clients five years ago.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I still run <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker</a>, which was created during that period of innovation that Federico refers to, but my focus now is on indie microblogging and the open web. I&#8217;m content to watch Twitter from the sidelines and wish Jack the best of luck.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;m catching up on some news, two posts today about Twitter caught me eye. First, very big news via Federico Viticci, that full tweet search <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/full-archive-search-api">is available even to third-party apps</a>. Twitter&#8217;s limited search was the main reason I originally built <a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">Tweet Library</a>. It&#8217;s fantastic that this data is now more easily available.</p>
<p>But it was this opening paragraph from <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/2970341/web-social/twitter-on-the-mac-do-your-job-or-get-out-of-the-way.html">Jason Snell&#8217;s article on Macworld</a> about Twitter neglecting the Mac version that got me thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Three years ago this month Twitter <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1168183/twitter_hands_down_new_strict_rules_for_third_party_developers.html">broke its covenant with the third-party developers</a> who helped fuel its initial growth and create some of its most innovative features. The message was clear: Twitter was in charge of its own platform, and while other Twitter apps would be tolerated, it would only be in limited fashion and for a limited time.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>It was around this time, nearly 3 years ago, that I posted my last tweet. My bet with <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/">Daniel</a> is over whether I will return to Twitter within 5 years. People ask if I&#8217;ll come back sooner, and if I did, what it would take. I&#8217;ve often struggled to articulate those conditions, because I think we are seeing <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/ev-on-twitter-third-party-devs.html">slow but consistent progress</a> to unwind the developer-hostile decisions made a few years ago. It may be that in a couple years the environment will be much improved, but there won&#8217;t be any single decision that &#8220;fixed&#8221; it, or it may be that Twitter is doomed to have changing leadership and there will never be any guarantees.</p>
<p>There is one thing, though. There is one change that was made while rolling out the version 1.1 Twitter API: they removed support for unauthenticated RSS feeds of user tweets or timelines. If they reversed that one decision, the next day I would be back on Twitter.</p>
<p>I can pick out a single feature like this, among every other improvement that third-party developers would love to see, because the combination of removing RSS and at the same time locking down the API — those changes together best represent the move away from the open web. Any other incremental improvement short of unauthenticated RSS, no matter how welcome, isn&#8217;t enough.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/116294584510/riposte-the-appnet-app-permanently-removed-from">Back in April</a>, the App.net app Riposte was removed from sale. Riposte wasn&#8217;t just the best client for App.net; I think it held its own against even the best Twitter apps, too. The push notification server for Riposte (and its messaging app complement, Whisper) was to keep running for some months and then shut down this summer.</p>
<p>Even if App.net is slowly fading away, like many users I still have Riposte on my home screen. I cross-post all <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">my microblog posts</a> from this blog to App.net. When I get replies and mentions on App.net, I like to see them as push notifications in Riposte. I can reply in the app easily, or skim through the timeline to see what else is going on.</p>
<p>Now the developers have launched a <a href="https://app.moonclerk.com/pay/q2j4zmciz4e">crowdfunding campaign</a> to keep the Riposte server running. Their goal is a modest $500 per year to cover AWS hosting and time to keep everything running smoothly. Even if you&#8217;re not very active on App.net anymore, consider donating as a thank-you for everything Riposte did for App.net, and for what it did to advance the state of UI design in social networking apps.</p>

<p>From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Daniel and Manton acknowledge celebration as a survival tactic, discuss the urgency of making ends meet as an indie, and examine changes underway at Twitter with interim CEO Jack Dorsey.”

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When App.net was first taking off, many microbloggers struggled with how to decide where to post their short-form writing. Should they post some topics to Twitter and others to App.net? Should they cross-post everything to both services? At the time, there was an informal consensus that cross-posting was a cheat. It couldn’t take advantage of each platform’s strengths, and followers might often see the same post twice.</p>
<p>I now believe that cross-posting is a good thing. Photos, as one example, are frequently cross-posted to both Instagram and Facebook. Tweets can be sent to Twitter <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/more-quick-blogging-workflows.html">as well as our own blogs</a>. Many apps like Instagram or Foursquare support and even encourage cross-posting. It’s good for developers because it helps spread knowledge of the publishing app, and it’s good for writers because it means there are multiple copies of our content.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/sneak-peek-screenshot.html">It’s no secret</a> that I’m building a microblog aggregation and publishing service. The goal is for us to get back to our roots with blogging — to write on our own web sites first, not as an afterthought to Twitter. Cross-posting is an important bootstrap for that.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a blog, <em>start one today</em>. It takes minutes to set up, and hardly any more time to wire up automatic tweeting <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">via IFTTT from your RSS feed</a>. Start with cross-posting and see if something interesting evolves from there.</p>

<p>Just acknowledging this publicly is progress. It’s now been almost 3 years since my last tweet. I don’t expect to return to Twitter, but I’m still very interested in whether there&#8217;ll be a noticeable change in direction from the new CEO.</p>

  “Launch one of these events and you’ll see a visually driven, curated collection of tweets. A team of editors, working under Katie Jacobs Stanton, who runs Twitter’s global media operations, will select what it thinks are the best and most relevant tweets and package them into a collection.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/06/twitter-project-lightning-timeline/">David Pierce wrote for Wired</a> with further speculation on what it could mean for Twitter. David starts with the premise that Twitter is basically full of junk:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Sure, yes, everyone’s Twitter is different—that’s one of the service’s best aspects, that you can follow anyone you want and see whatever you want. Unfortunately, this only works if everyone on Twitter isn’t terrible most of the time. They are.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The essay continues, describing Project Lightning as the death of the Twitter timeline as we know it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With this change, Twitter doesn’t have to look like an endlessly flowing, context-free stream of tweets; instead, you can see a hand-curated set of tweets, links, images, and videos related to what’s happening right now. You see one at a time, swiping through them until you get to the end. And there’s an end!”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Since I haven’t seen this new feature, I can’t tell whether it’s a major shift in how Twitter is used. <a href="http://www.macstories.net/linked/twitters-project-lightning/">Federico Viticci is optimistic</a> about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “This is another example of Twitter moving beyond Legacy Twitter and the belief that Twitter is still only a timeline of tweets in chronological order. The company has been enhancing the service with media improvements and design changes aimed at making Twitter less static – the opposite of a traditional timeline. If anything, they&#8217;ve been moving <em>too slowly</em> in this area.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Federico on the value of curation and surfacing great content. But also the timeline must remain at the heart of Twitter, just as a reverse-chronological list of posts has been on every blog home page since the term weblog was coined 18 years ago.</p>
<p>Dave Winer calls these timelines “rivers”, and last week <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/06/19/riverbrowserOpenSourceRelease.html">he open-sourced a browser</a> for the River.js timeline files. Formatted as JSONP, you can think of River.js as conceptually the same as an RSS feed, except that it’s easy to display with HTML using only JavaScript.</p>
<p>I plan to fully support outputting River.js in the project I’m working on. For the last few years, Twitter has had a monopoly on the timeline. We need to break that up. The first step is <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">encouraging microblogs everywhere</a>, and the next step is to build tools that embrace the timeline experience. If you’d like to see my take on this, please <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the project announce list</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, to not much fanfare at all because nearly everyone had already lost interest, <a href="http://ello.co/">Ello</a> shipped their iPhone app. Credit to them for attempting to build a new social network, because this is extremely difficult. But it seems to me that Ello is a bust. They needed a more compelling pitch than simply “no ads”.</p>
<p>(I’ve heard some people joke about Ello’s monospaced font, but I kind of love that about Ello. If you want to differentiate yourself, design isn’t a bad place to start.)</p>
<p>App.net was — and likely will be for many more years — the most successful attempt to compete with Twitter and Facebook. If they fell short, despite how many things they got right, how can another clone of existing social networks hope to do any better?</p>
<p>I wish I could cheer Ello on. Spend enough time clicking around on Ello and you discover a niche but fascinating community, full of beautiful art and photos. It’s just that after so many months, there’s still not even a mention of an official API on the <a href="https://ello.co/wtf/resources/feature-list/">planned features page</a>.</p>
<p>The next great social platform can’t be yet another centralized system. It has to be more distributed and more open even than App.net. It has to focus on writing and bloggers and embrace what is good about the web. Ello doesn’t do any of these things.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a great conversion with Seth Clifford one night at WWDC, about writing and blogging. We all want to get better at writing and posting more frequently. As I mentioned <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/we-need-more-bad-ideas.html">in yesterday’s post</a>, the best way to improve anything is to do more of it, more often.</p>
<p>I believe there are two important facets to microblogging. The first is the timeline experience: a reverse-chronological list of posts from your friends, like you see on Twitter. The second is that posting should be effortless: if there’s less friction between your idea and publishing it, you’ll write more often. So a big part of posting regularly is just having a system that makes it easy.</p>
<p><a href="http://sethclifford.me/2015/06/auto-posting-to-wordpress-and-archiving-in-dropbox-with-drafts/">Seth updated his iOS blogging workflow</a> by using Drafts and WordPress’s email-to-blog feature. As a nice bonus, he gets Markdown files of each post saved to Dropbox:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Drafts allows you to send email as an action. WordPress allows you to post into the system via email. Using a combination of the action and the <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/post-by-email/">Jetpack plugin’s email functionality</a>, I can go from idea to published in seconds, without touching the WP iOS app (which continues to get better, but still isn’t <em>fast</em>) and get my local copy stored away.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Also this week, Ben Brooks has switched his core Twitter posting to go through WordPress. He has a <a href="http://benb.me/">standalone microblog at benb.me</a> where the posts live. They go out to Twitter automatically via IFTTT. Posting to a blog first and then Twitter second seems like a simple idea, but it is extremely powerful. Years from now you end up with an archive of all your short-form writing at your own domain. Not as an afterthought, but as the <em>default</em>.</p>
<p>The great thing about blogging is there’s no one correct way to do this stuff. I’m really happy to see these solutions from Seth and Ben, and I know other folks are working on similar workflows.</p>
