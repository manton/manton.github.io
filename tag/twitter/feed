				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twitter has lost some of what made it special for communities 5 years ago. I&#8217;ve noticed a few trends:</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter’s 140-character limit and easy retweeting encourage and amplify negative tweets. Sincerity is less common. Everything is an opportunity for a joke.</li>
<li>Widely followed, long-time Twitter users don’t find the joy they used to when interacting with followers. Some have retreated to private Slack channels, at the cost of public discussion and approachability.</li>
<li>Developers have never completely forgiven Twitter for crippling the API. This doesn’t directly impact most users anymore, but it’s a backdrop that gives every new Twitter feature a tone of distrust. Progress is slow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, blog comments have slowly been killed off over that same period. The rise of social networks, combined with the technical problems of fighting blog comment spam, pushed most bloggers to prefer answering questions on Twitter.</p>
<p><a href="http://beckyhansmeyer.com/2016/03/07/follow-up-the-nuances-of-online-discussion/">Becky Hansmeyer writes about</a> the intersection of these problems — that some Twitter users avoid public discussion, but most blogs no longer have comments to fall back on — by pointing to <a href="http://blog.bellebethcooper.com/online-relationships.html">a post from Belle Beth Cooper</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Belle’s post really resonated with me because it reminded me of something I think about a lot: when an ever-increasing number of blogs and media outlets are disabling comment sections, where do decent, thoughtful people bring their discussions? I only offer readers one way to contact me on this site, and it’s via Twitter. But what if, like Belle, you no longer use Twitter (or never did in the first place)?”
</p></blockquote>
<p>We didn’t realized how much we lost when we turned our backs on blog comments years ago. Just look at <a href="https://red-sweater.com/blog/181/the-cocoa-carbon-advantage#comments">one of Daniel Jalkut&#8217;s blog posts from 10 years ago</a>, which he and I discuss on an upcoming episode of Core Intuition. 53 comments! And they&#8217;re all preserved along with the original content. That&#8217;s difficult to do when comments are spread across Twitter and easily lost.</p>
<p>It’s time to take what we’ve since learned from social networks and apply it the openness of cross-site replies. That’s why I want to support <a href="https://indiewebcamp.com/Webmention">Webmention</a>. As Becky mentions, <a href="https://www.civilcomments.com/">Civil Comments</a> look great too. I think we can encourage both in parallel: distributed comments like Webmention for sites that can support it <em>and</em> better centralized comments like Civil.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The echo chamber. We only follow people who we already agree with. We only jump on the bandwagon of snark and ridicule when it’s already the accepted narrative, and thus safe to be part of the mob.</p>
<p>But sometimes you&#8217;ll find an area where you aren&#8217;t completely in line with the crowd’s opinion. There’s a topic that keeps coming up for which you have something to add. The default story is missing an important angle.</p>
<p>When you disagree, that’s what you should write about, and you should post it to your blog. 140 characters thrown against wave after wave of mainstream opinion tweets will be drowned out. A blog post isn’t a cheap opinion; it’s a statement that what you think matters.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my posts about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">defining what makes a microblog post</a> and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">guidelines for RSS</a>, I talked a little about links but didn&#8217;t explore linkblogging. While many blog authors post primarily long essays, shorter link blogs are a common approach for bloggers who want to post new content several times a day.</p>
<p>Essentially two types of link blogs have evolved since the early days of blogging. The most traditional link blog can be seen in <a href="http://scripting.com/#linksTab">Dave Winer&#8217;s posts</a> (click on the Links tab). These are links with a very short commentary. Many tweets are like this. In a way, this format is the purest form of microblogging.</p>
<p>The second type of link blog starts to fall outside the limits of microblogging. Instead of just including a URL, authors use a quote from the linked material as the foundation for the post. The majority of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Daring Fireball</a> posts adopt this format. While John Gruber is known for his full essays, those longer posts are infrequent today. He keeps his site active by linking to other interesting essays and tacking on his own brief opinion.</p>
<p>Daring Fireball has become so successful that Gruber&#8217;s approach to linkblogging has been copied by many other sites. <a href="http://macstories.net/">MacStories</a>, <a href="http://sixcolors.com/">Six Colors</a>, <a href="http://onefoottsunami.com/">One Foot Tsunami</a>, <a href="http://verynicewebsite.net/">John Moltz&#8217;s Very Nice Web Site</a>, and <a href="http://marco.org/">Marco Arment&#8217;s blog</a> are just a handful that follow this pattern. All of these sites post the occasional essay, but most blog posts link away to an external site in the RSS item, not back to their own site.</p>
<p>At a technical level, this difference can best be seen in the RSS feed&#8217;s &lt;link&gt; and &lt;guid&gt; elements. These elements will contain URLs that either link back to the main site, or link away to an external site.</p>
<p>Here is where this evolving approach to link blogs starts to break down. Let&#8217;s take an example from Six Colors, one of my favorite sites. (I recommend <a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/">subscribing</a>. The members-only secret podcast with Jason and Dan Moren is really fun, and the email magazine is great too.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://sixcolors.com/link/2015/09/hulu-unlocks-the-albatross/">link post about Hulu&#8217;s pricing</a>, Jason Snell actually writes <em>4 paragraphs</em> of commentary (plus a footnote). This is more like an essay than a short link post that points to the external site.</p>
<p>Another example is when <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/twitter-launches-moments/">MacStories linked to Twitter&#8217;s launch of Moments</a>. A few paragraphs of quoted text, <em>5 paragraphs</em> of MacStories commentary. The commentary is as important or even more important to read than whatever Federico is linking to.</p>
<p>Sometimes we read sites like MacStories, Six Colors, or Daring Fireball more for the commentary than for what is being linked to. But when using an RSS reader, there is too much confusion about where an item&#8217;s link goes when clicked if the site&#8217;s feed isn&#8217;t consistent about linking everything back to its own site.</p>
<p>And in fact Jason Snell acknowledges this problem by offering two separate RSS feeds: the default one, with a mix of links back to Six Colors for essays and pointed elsewhere for link posts; and another feed with everything linking back to Six Colors, where the commentary lives. He also attempts to minimize confusion on his own site by giving each type of post its own icon in the site design.</p>
<p>The less clear-cut the distinction between essays and link posts, the more confusion we introduce to readers. In some ways, this mixed approach really <em>only</em> works for Daring Fireball, because his feature essays are so long, and so obviously different in format to the rest of the link posts.</p>
<p>Good conventions for blogging have been at a standstill for years. While part of the appeal of indie blogging is there&#8217;s no one &#8220;right&#8221; way to do it, and authors can have a strong voice and design that isn&#8217;t controlled by a platform vendor, we must accept that Twitter has taken off because it has a great user experience compared to blogs. It’s effortless to tweet and the timeline is consistent. For blogging to improve and thrive, it should have just as straightforward a user experience as social networks wherever possible.</p>
<p>Luckily, RSS already has everything we need for clients to visually distinguish between link posts and regular ones. If the &lt;link&gt; element points to a domain other than the one for the site, it’s probably a link post. If the &lt;link&gt; and site domain match, it’s a full post.</p>
<p>I’ve adopted this in my new microblogging platform by exposing the domain in the UI itself, at the end of the title or microblog post whenever it’s a link post. If it’s a full post, the link isn’t added. And for either type of post, the timestamp links back to whatever was in the &lt;link&gt;.</p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot from one of Dave’s posts. Note that the link was <em>not</em> in the RSS text. It was added by my app automatically:</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2016/snippets_linkblog.png" width="550" height="105" alt="linkblog example" border="0" /></center></p>
<p>This has been a long post, but it boils down to two simple recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re a blog author and you’re adding any significant commentary, the RSS feed should point back to your site.</li>
<li>If you’re an RSS client developer, the difference between link posts and full posts should be exposed in the UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that adopting these will bring more consistency to blogging. Users won’t need to hover over links, or guess what will happen on a click or tap. It’s a small change that will make reading blogs a little better.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the latest <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/16">Under the Radar podcast</a>, Marco Arment and David Smith talk about ways to make your app more robust. That includes tips for scaling your app with a lot of data, and also dealing with potentially hostile user data. It’s that last point that I’ve been thinking the most about lately.</p>
<p>With the experience of building Tumblr and Instapaper, Marco is clearly now hesitant to ship app features that accept arbitrary user-generated content, because a small indie company just doesn’t have the resources to deal with spam and abuse. Instead, he suggests outsourcing whenever possible. For example, letting Apple accept and reject podcasts, and basing the Overcast podcast directory search on that already-vetted list.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re building a Twitter-like service. As we all know, hate is widespread on Twitter. At times, it seems impossible to even have a G-rated Twitter experience. But the problem is less that users can publish terrible tweets, and more that it is so easy to be <em>exposed to those tweets</em> with search, trending topics, retweets, and replies.</p>
<p>As I work on my microblogging project, I’m trying to be aware of these points in the platform where bad content can leak out. So I don’t have global search or trending topics. I also don’t make it easy to stumble upon random users. But I do have replies, which by default will currently go out as push notifications if you have the iPhone app installed. It’s that area that I should focus my attention.</p>
<p>Two options that come to mind for minimizing abuse in replies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t allow replies from people you aren’t following. This solves the problem, but it comes at the expense of discussion. It removes the accessibility that many people love about Twitter’s asynchronous following model.</li>
<li>Quarantine or attempt to classify replies so they don’t bubble up in your timeline or as notifications by default. This would be like an over-aggressive email spam filter. Difficult to get right and possibly routed around by clever microbloggers.</li>
</ul>
<p>After listening to Marco and David, and reviewing the full scope of what I’ve been trying to build, I’m pretty concerned about this. I’m looking at <a href="https://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>, and other metrics internal to my app for judging content and suspicious user accounts, but I may be a little in over my head on this issue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two new microblog-related services have launched. This week, <a href="http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/02/09/0995.html">Dave Winer announced River5</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “So I decided it was time to do a restart of my JavaScript RSS aggregator, and it&#8217;s now ready for Node users &#8212; it&#8217;s called <a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a>. [&#8230;] This is a foundation for developers to build on, but it&#8217;s also possible for an adventurous user to set up their own rivers.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>River5 is built on a few XML and JSON formats, including River.js. I’m pretty interested in River.js as a format for aggregating multiple feeds together, so I’ve supported it in my new microblog platform. As a next-generation RSS, though, I prefer the proposal I wrote about in a post called <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/rss-for-microblogs.html">RSS for microblogs</a>.</p>
<p>Next up is <a href="https://github.com/buckket/twtxt">twtxt</a>, which attempts to recreate Twitter as a distributed, command-line based system with self-hosted text files:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Instead of signing up at a closed and/or regulated microblogging platform, getting your status updates out with twtxt is as easy as putting them in a publicly accessible text file. The URL pointing to this file is your identity, your account. twtxt then tracks these text files, like a feedreader, and builds your unique timeline out of them, depending on which files you track.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m less sure what to think of twtxt. The simple plaintext format is nice, but we already have a good infrastructure for this with RSS. And <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/inline-links-in-microblog-posts.html">as I’ve noted before</a>, having HTML in RSS with inline styles and links is nice for microblogs, and it’s not clear to me whether that would fit well with twtxt.</p>
<p>If you want to start an indie microblog, my suggestion remains to use existing blog software that can generate simple RSS feeds. Short posts, no titles. This is a widely-deployed format that we can continue to work with for years to come.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see the setting in my Twitter account yet. As a user, I hardly care, because I don&#8217;t read the Twitter timeline directly anyway. But I&#8217;ll be watching how people react to this and how it might affect my own microblogging plans.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Matt Gemmell has <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/briefly/">started including shorter posts</a> on his blog. <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/tiered-social-media/">Today he writes</a> about Twitter’s decision to not show ads to some popular users:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;There are problems with that approach, the main one being the tacit admission that their ads are detrimental. If you’re rewarding people by reducing the hostility of their experience, maybe just fix the experience for everyone, and find something positive to charge for instead.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ads are the worst. I don’t know if it’s possible to build a large-scale social network like Twitter or Facebook without being mostly ad-supported, but I&#8217;d like to believe it is. WordPress.com — which has elements of a social network, even though we don’t consider it one — might be the closest successful attempt.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soroush Khanlou, looking for <a href="http://khanlou.com/2016/01/a-call-for-blogs/">more new blogs to read</a>, makes a great point that the process of blogging leads to better writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Opening my RSS reading and finding 30 unread items makes me happy. Opening Twitter and seeing 150 new tweets feels like work. I&#8217;m not sure why that is. I think Twitter has become more negative, and the ease of posting quick bursts makes posting negative stuff easy. With blogging, writing something long requires time, words, and an argument. Even the passing thought of ‘should I post this’ creates a filter that lets only better <em>stuff</em> through.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think there’s something to that. It’s often only after writing our thoughts down that we fully understand how we feel about a topic.</p>
<p>And here’s where I bring this back to microblogging. Because when starting a post, we don&#8217;t always know whether it will be long or short. How often have you seen a series of tweets that in hindsight even the author would agree should have been a blog post?</p>
<p>This is less of a problem if instead of tweeting you start out with the intention of posting to your own site. Short post can stay short, and posts requiring more words can naturally expand to a full essay.</p>
<p>I don’t think that our short-form, seemingly unimportant writing should exclusively be on centralized networks. If it’s worth the time to write something — whether a thoughtful essay or a fleeting one-off microblog post — then it’s worth owning and publishing at your own domain name.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve said before that there&#8217;s something about the 140-character limit that brings out both the best and worst in people. <a href="https://nickharris.wordpress.com/2016/01/20/twitter/">Nick Harris hints at this</a> while writing about taking a break from Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;But largely ignoring the Twitter Noise Machine – particularly when my timeline becomes the Twitter Hate Machine – is going to be good for me.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>He also talks about the obsession with stats and follower counts, which <a href="http://inessential.com/2016/01/20/nick_on_twitter">Brent Simmons picks up on</a> and carries further:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I did have Google Analytics for a few months in 2014 when I was doing sponsorships. I spent too much time looking at the numbers and trying to make them go up. But no amount of going-up is ever satisfying: I just wanted more.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>When designing my new microblogging platform, I made a conscious decision to <em>not even show follower counts</em>. You can get the followers from the API, but I didn&#8217;t want to have the numbers right in your face when viewing someone&#8217;s profile. It&#8217;s too easy for us to make a judgement based on how many followers they have, and so miss out on whatever they have to say.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whenever someone says &#8220;I don&#8217;t read RSS&#8221;, I actually hear &#8220;I don&#8217;t read Manton&#8217;s blog&#8221;. I could give plenty of reasons why they&#8217;re missing out by ignoring RSS — it&#8217;s still the best way to keep up with bloggers you like who aren&#8217;t linked or retweeted often enough to bubble up on Twitter — but some people won&#8217;t be convinced.</p>
<p>Over three years ago I stopped posting to Twitter. I know it was the right move on principle because there was a real cost in exposure, with fewer people actively keeping up with what I&#8217;ve been working on. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/05/core_intuition_136.html">As I&#8217;ve said before</a>: it wouldn’t mean anything if it didn’t cost me anything.</p>
<p>And yet, many people get their news from Twitter. Since I started <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">microblogging on my own site</a>, I&#8217;ve had time to reflect on the roll of indie microblogging and cross-posting. I think the <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">IndieWebCamp has it right</a>: publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere. I wrote more back in July <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/embrace-cross-posting.html">about cross-posting</a>.</p>
<p>Most importantly, as I work on a microblog publishing platform of my own, how can I develop a solid cross-posting feature if I don&#8217;t actively use it myself? <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">I&#8217;ve recommended IFTTT</a> to beta testers, but only by using it myself can I know where the gaps in functionality are.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been experimenting. All of my posts now go out to the Twitter account @manton2. This was an account I created 6 years ago for testing. Except for a few of the first tweets, I&#8217;ve cleared out the test content and given it a new life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting some advantages and disadvantages to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can write at my domain name and own my content, but have it automatically sent to Twitter for folks who are there. Unlike how I&#8217;ve been treating these cross-posts to App.net, I&#8217;m not sure whether I will stay engaged and answer replies on Twitter. We&#8217;ll see.</li>
<li>Most of my microblog posts are around 200 characters. These will get truncated on Twitter, with a link back to my site. Full essays get a nicer title and link. I&#8217;ll continue to improve this.</li>
<li>I&#8217;m effectively starting over with zero followers, compared to the 5000 followers I left @manton with. I have no plans to resume using my original account, though. Think of the &#8220;2&#8221; in @manton2 as a reminder that this is a mirror of my posts, and an imperfect one.</li>
</ul>
