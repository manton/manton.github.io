			<p><a href="https://www.twitterflight.com/">Twitter&#8217;s new mobile developer conference</a> is tomorrow. <a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/10/20/wsj-twitter-peace-offering">Marco Arment writes</a> about whether developers should give Twitter another chance:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Twitter started out as a developer-friendly company, then they became a developer-hostile company, and now they’re trying to be a developer-friendly company again. If I had to pick a company to have absolute power over something very important, Twitter wouldn’t be very high on the list.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2014/10/21/whyISayYesToTwitter.html">Dave Winer responds</a> that for now, we&#8217;ll be okay trusting Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Twitter is not going to screw us in the short term. They need us as much as we need them. Independent developers are where wholly new ideas come from. You can&#8217;t hire people to do that to work inside companies.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>The unique tragedy with Twitter&#8217;s changing attitude toward developers is that so many of Twitter&#8217;s early innovations <a href="http://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/">did come from third-party developers</a>. The new leadership displayed an incredible disrespect for the value developers added to both the ecosystem and core platform.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in the &#8220;short term&#8221; it&#8217;s still happening. Not 4 years ago, not 2 years ago — just <em>1 month ago</em>, TwitPic announced they are shutting down after a legal threat from Twitter. <a href="../../../2014/09/twitpic-and-whats-next.html">It&#8217;s a loss for the web</a>, leaving millions of broken image links in old tweets. This latest third-party developer casualty from Twitter&#8217;s policies comes practically on the eve of their new developer conference.</p>
<p>I agree with Dave&#8217;s larger points, though, on mirroring content to your own blog in addition to Twitter and Facebook. His <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a> is a step forward for RSS and the open web while still embracing social networks. We need more tools like it.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/manton/status/254228056657494016">2 years ago</a> I chose to stop tweeting from my personal Twitter account as a minor protest. I don&#8217;t expect everyone else to take such an extreme stance. We can agree on open formats and the power of microblogging while disagreeing on how to interact with Twitter.</p>
<p>(Skeptics say that leaving Twitter is a pointless gesture, like a pebble thrown into a river. The timeline flows on and the outrage is washed away as if it didn&#8217;t happen. If leaving doesn&#8217;t make an impact, why bother? But it does matter. It matters not for the change it creates directly for others, but for how it changed me. In the same way that writing an essay will solidify your thoughts on a subject, posting that last tweet has given me a new clarity from which to judge whether my own products are on the right track, living up to my ideals.)</p>
<p>Back to the present. On the flight up to Çingleton and back, I finally got around to reading the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591847087/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1591847087&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mantonorg&amp;linkId=B2NMWRQKBXSK7MCT">Hatching Twitter</a>. Since I was on Twitter near the beginning, I remember many events covered in the book: the launch at SXSW, the CEO shuffling, the names of early engineers who I&#8217;ve crossed paths with. I love how the book blends together things that I know are real with other details that must be more contrived or exaggerated, creating an engaging read that would seem to border on historical fiction if we didn&#8217;t know that it was basically all true.</p>
<p>Hatching Twitter captures the power struggles inside Twitter and fills a book with them. And that&#8217;s really the foundation for Marco&#8217;s post: based on Twitter&#8217;s history, we probably haven&#8217;t seen the last leadership change at the company. Twitter <em>might</em> have a strong future but it surely has an uncertain one.</p>
<p>My next product is about microblogging, and it has to launch in the real world where Twitter dominates. But I view that as a reality, not a feature requirement. I think I&#8217;ll be happier as a developer, and my app will actually be more compelling, if I design and build it for a world without Twitter.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Yesterday you had lunch with friends or family and posted a photo of your food and location to Twitter. It didn&#8217;t matter much. You put it on Twitter and didn&#8217;t care that you didn&#8217;t <a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">have a copy</a> or didn&#8217;t post it to your own blog first, because controlling that trivial bit of content just didn&#8217;t seem important at the time.</p>
<p>5 years later, 10 years later, 15 years later. That lunch is magic now — a captured moment, something you wouldn&#8217;t remember and didn&#8217;t think to record elsewhere unless you keep a comprehensive private journal. Maybe it was the day before a significant event or on a trip. The true context is only revealed with hindsight.</p>
<p>I wrote this blog post because I wanted to follow up on <a href="../../../2014/10/blogging-every-day.html">my post about blogging every day</a>, underscoring that seemingly unimportant events can carry great meaning later. Those common everyday activities that don&#8217;t seem noteworthy today? <em>That&#8217;s our life.</em> One after another, strung together for days and then years until we die. It&#8217;s the culture of the 21st century scattered among millions of micro posts. And it&#8217;ll be lost to time if we don&#8217;t curate it.</p>
<p>Yesterday was unremarkable only because we&#8217;re too close to it. Later we&#8217;ll understand that it meant everything. And if that&#8217;s true, let&#8217;s aspire to something greater than our content being sliced up and interspersed with ads on someone else&#8217;s platform.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Matt Mullenweg on <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/10/streak/">being challenged to blog every day</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I thought blogging every day would be a burden, but it actually became a great source of joy. It was more a shift in mindset than anything — every day I read things I think are interesting, share links with friends, have thoughts that are 80% of a blog post, and write a ton privately, it was just a matter of catching those moments and turning them into something that was shared with the world.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Whenever I get out of the habit of writing daily, it creates friction to get anything published. When you post every day, there&#8217;s no expectation that all posts have to be great. But when you wait too long, there&#8217;s an increasing feeling that the next post has to be perfect.</p>
<p>Tools that make writing effortless — like Twitter&#8217;s limited, fast UI — should be part of the next generation of blogging software. I think that&#8217;s going to be around microblogs. Just because traditional blogs initially failed to embrace microblogging doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t take that format back with better server apps and clients.</p>
<p>When people first started paying attention to Twitter, the criticism was that no one cared &#8220;what you had for breakfast&#8221;. But if you look at some of my earliest posts on this weblog, many are equally trivial. What appears unremarkable today — the first lunch you had with co-workers at a brand new job, the stop at REI to get a tent for an upcoming family campout, the missed flight on the way to a great conference — might carry important meaning in later years, looking back. It hurts the web to keep that <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/09/28/myManifestoForWebWriting.html">locked in a silo</a>.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p><a href="http://appstore.com/tweetlibrary">Tweet Library 2.6</a> shipped today after 13 days waiting for review from Apple. This release adds support for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus screen sizes, as well as improvements to sharing so that iOS 8 extensions can be used, and a fix for an annoying random crashing bug.</p>
<p>I also finally dropped iOS 5 and 6 support for this release. I wanted to support the iPad 1 as long as possible because those were my very first customers when I launched Tweet Library 1.0 almost exactly 4 years ago. I hope they got an incredible value out of the app in that time (all upgrades have been free). It feels good to turn a corner and require iOS 7.</p>

				<a href="../../../2014/10/return-to-open-apis.html" rel="bookmark">Return to open APIs</a>
			</h1>
								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>In 2014, web app APIs basically look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>JSON or XML API layer for a web site&#8217;s content and functionality.</li>
<li>Potential client developers must register with the web site and get some kind of API key for access.</li>
<li>OAuth is used to grant access without giving out passwords.</li>
</ul>
<p>A more cynical view of that last point could be rewritten as: OAuth is used to control and limit access so that the API is inaccessible without approval from the web site.</p>
<p>This all seems fairly normal today. I required an API key for Tweet Marker because that&#8217;s just what you did, especially if you wanted to charge or limit an API. But it didn&#8217;t always used to be this way — remember when you could hit the Twitter API with just a user&#8217;s password? — and it doesn&#8217;t have to be this way forever.</p>
<p>For my next web app I&#8217;m going to have an API that is more open, requiring no app registration. Instead it will be <em>user-centric</em>, with password tokens that a user can paste into their favorite compatible app for authentication. (My web app doesn&#8217;t have traditional passwords at all.)</p>
<p>Not having API keys removes a whole set of complexity: no need to write all the backend code to support managing them, no need for developers to register, no need for me to judge who should get access. Whenever possible, APIs should be nearly as open as the normal web, where Safari and &#8220;curl&#8221; don&#8217;t need to register with a web site just to download its home page. Users are in the best position to know which apps should get access to their account anyway.</p>
<p>If we can loosen APIs, I think it makes the web better. <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/09/28/#a1411931064">Dave Winer takes it one step further</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;What we really need, and I hope to help make happen, is a network based on open syndication of content. Then there is no one to ask for an API, because there&#8217;s no one in charge.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been calling my latest project halfway decentralized. I&#8217;m still in charge, but just barely.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>I&#8217;m working on a new project around timelines and microblogs. It consumes RSS feeds, so I&#8217;ve been wondering how strict to be when accepting posts. What does microblog mean, anyway?</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">Wikipedia defines it</a> this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Microblogging is a broadcast medium that exists in the form of blogging. A microblog differs from a traditional blog in that its content is typically smaller in both actual and aggregated file size.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>But that&#8217;s not quite specific enough. From my perspective, a microblog post has these qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must have an RSS feed.</li>
<li>Does <em>not</em> have an RSS item title.</li>
<li>Contains short post text, 280 characters or less.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not having an RSS item title might take some getting used to for mainstream blogging clients and readers. Most RSS apps assume that all posts have a title, even though titles are technically optional in the spec. But I think this is an important distinction because if you think about Twitter-like posting, it should be fast and convenient; making up a title first interrupts the flow of posting.</p>
<p>I picked 280 characters instead of App.net&#8217;s 256 characters because it&#8217;s slightly less nerdy, and feels right at exactly double Twitter&#8217;s 140. This should be thought of as more of a guideline than a rule, though — just something to shoot for.</p>
<p>What do you think? I&#8217;d love to hear your feedback. <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/09/05/blogs_are_cool">Post to your own blog</a> and then <a href="mailto:manton@manton.org">send me an email</a>.</p>

			<p>After being threatened by Twitter over trademarks, <a href="http://blog.twitpic.com/2014/09/twitpic-is-shutting-down/">Twitpic has decided to shut down in 3 weeks</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;We encountered several hurdles and difficulties in getting our trademark approved even though our first use in commerce predated other applications, but we worked through each challenge and in fact had just recently finished the last one. During the &#8216;published for opposition&#8217; phase of the trademark is when Twitter reached out to our counsel and implied we could be denied access to their API if we did not give up our mark.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Twitpic is not a small hobby site. It grew to a $3 million business at its height in 2012 according to <a href="http://mixergy.com/interviews/noah-everett-twitpic-interview/">this Mixergy interview</a>. Founder Noah Everett also attempted to launch a Twitter-like service called Heello, though it never gained much traction and appears to be offline.</p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/09/04/twitpic">John Gruber asks</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Why not just change the name to something original?&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>While I wonder if that comment may have a dual purpose, aimed as much at <a href="http://standardmarkdown.com/">Standard Markdown</a> as Twitpic, I&#8217;ll answer it anyway. Because Twitter has a well-documented history of stepping on developers. This trademark fight is just the latest, and at some point, I have to assume that Noah was fed up and called it: <em>enough is enough</em>.</p>
<p>Enough with building apps in a toxic ecosystem. Developers who care about microblogging should <em>take it back</em>. Let&#8217;s build tools for the web that will matter, that will move the web forward and make our writing last, not locked away behind APIs and ads.</p>

			<p><a href="../../../2014/05/snippets.html">I mentioned earlier this year</a> that I really liked how <a href="http://noahread.net/snippets">Noah Read</a> posted tweets and photos to his own site, calling them snippets. I&#8217;m borrowing that name and implementing something similar here. If you visit <a href="../../../index.html">my home page</a>, you&#8217;ll see these short posts already interspersed alongside regular, longer posts.</p>
<p>These new snippets don&#8217;t show up in the normal RSS feed. There&#8217;s a <a href="../../../indexfa2c.php">separate feed at /snippets.xml</a> for them, and they get their own category for browsing on the web. I&#8217;ll also be cross-posting them to App.net.</p>
<p>Like the posts in Dave Winer&#8217;s new <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a>, these RSS items don&#8217;t have titles. They&#8217;ll be short like a tweet or App.net post: usually 100-200 characters.</p>
<p>This is the first step in a larger project that I&#8217;m working on — something fun that reminds me of the early days of blogging. But if nothing else, it&#8217;s nice to control my own content again. I should have kept all these microblog posts on my own domain years ago.</p>

<p>We also talk about Automattic raising money, blog software, and what that sandwich shop that Daniel avoids has to do with customer service.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/05/07/manton-adn-api">Marco Arment responds</a> to my comment that developers should have seen the potential of the App.net API as something much bigger than Twitter. I wanted <a href="../../../2014/05/appnet_niche.html">my post</a> to be short, but Marco makes good points that are worth following up on. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Building an app on someone else’s API, rather than making your own, is a huge risk: it usually only pays off if the service provides a huge existing userbase and hard-to-duplicate functionality. App.net never offered either. They started out facing the typical social-network chicken-and-egg problem, put a huge paywall in front to prevent any growth, and tried to alleviate that by adding more chicken-and-egg problems to their offerings.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Building entirely on App.net for <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> was indeed a huge risk, and one that we expected would take time to pay off. It was a bet on the future. We are incredibly proud of our app and the response it got in the App.net community, but our goal was always to make an app <a href="../../../2014/01/no_coincidence.html">that appealed to everyone</a>, not just a small niche of tech folks. We’ve actually been working for over a month on a new version of Sunlit that expands the reach of the app beyond App.net, and coincidentally it just went into review at Apple this week.</p>
<p>But I think the chicken-and-egg problem was solvable. The main issue with iOS apps is that they couldn’t sign up a new user directly in the app. This made sense when App.net was a paid-only service, because you’d run into in-app purchase issues with Apple, but it became more technically feasible when the free tier launched.</p>
<p>The App.net founders also seemed receptive to the idea. There just wasn’t time to make it happen. I believe this single roadblock prevented any potentially-mainstream <a href="../../../2013/08/waiting_for_appnets.html">killer apps</a> built on App.net from getting off the ground. If it’s not easy to open a third-party app, create an account, and start using the service, too many people will give up. (Our numbers showed that only 40% of Sunlit downloads actually signed in to use the app for real.)</p>
<p>However, building our own backend for the app would also be very challenging and expensive. We are not syncing small bits of data around. It’s a photo sharing app, so right off the bat you’ve got big files that have to be hosted somewhere. On top of that there’s collaboration features, so you need not just user accounts but private sync channels that have specific read/write access to certain users. Plus all the metadata and formats to support syncing text, photos, and location check-in information. Not to mention publishing HTML, thumbnails, and maps. It’s daunting.</p>
<p>(In fact, it’s so daunting, I don’t think there’s a single app in the App Store that has feature-parity with Sunlit. The app simply could not have been built by a tiny team of 2 part-time developers if building a whole backend infrastructure first was a prerequisite.)</p>
<p>Marco closes with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “As much as App.net wanted to be — and eventually was — much more than a Twitter clone, it got the vast majority of its initial funding, enthusiasm, and developer support from people’s anger at Twitter’s dickification. But internet outrage doesn’t last long. Since App.net never became the new primary place where our friends all hung out, most of us never left Twitter — we all just accept that they’re dicks now, and we forgot about App.net.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s an argument to be made that App.net’s core mistake was building the Alpha web interface only far enough to match Twitter’s features and then moving on to other things. Instead, they could have kept improving Alpha until it was significantly better than Twitter, so good that it couldn’t be ignored. By doing so, maybe they would have also more effectively demonstrated the power of the API underneath.</p>
<p>I assume that App.net chose not to do this so they wouldn’t compete with developers. After all, the service was founded on the idea that developers should be respected and given every opportunity to succeed. Finding the right balance to showcase the platform with first-party apps without stepping on developers is not always easy. We can argue about which missteps were the most costly, but the founders never wavered on their original principles and they promoted every app that launched on the platform. That means something.</p>
<p>As for outrage not lasting long on the internet, Marco’s totally right. I just <a href="../../../2014/05/would_i_go_back.html">don’t forget that easily</a>.</p>

			<p>Justin Williams covers several aspects of this week’s App.net news, <a href="http://carpeaqua.com/2014/05/06/lessons-from-app-net/">comparing it to his own Glassboard service</a>. On finding a profitable niche:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Finding an audience of people interested in your platform is challenging. This isn’t Field of Dreams where if you build it people will magically appear. Once you find that niche of users, you’ve got to ensure they’re also the type of folks that are willing to pay to support your platform. If they aren’t, you keep looking for a niche that will sustain your product.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>He also hits on the main thing that was probably holding App.net back: the stigma that it was just a Twitter clone. I’m more than a little disappointed that fellow developers didn’t get the power of the App.net API. Does <a href="http://sunlit.io/">Sunlit</a> <em>look</em> like a Twitter app? Give me a break. App.net is hands down the best API of its kind.</p>
<p>So now we figure out what’s next. In the short term, not much changes. Tomorrow I’ll read my App.net timeline, make a few posts, reply and star as usual. Next week I’ll do the same. At WWDC I’ll use App.net messaging apps to coordinate meeting up with friends.</p>
<p>There’s no shame in shooting for the stars and missing. I’m thankful that even as the founders tried a few things outside micro-blogging over the last year, they never compromised on their original mission for the service. They never sold out users or developers, and the servers hum along in testament to that fact, as if nothing that’s good will ever really change.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Before <a href="http://www.revolution60.com/page2/index.php?id=84850310691">some of the recent discussion</a> about the future of App.net, <a href="https://alpha.app.net/walruscp/post/25988120">Colin Pekruhn asked a question</a>, directed at Ben Brooks and me, about whether we’d go back to Twitter if App.net failed. My answer (and his) was a very clear “no”. Here’s what I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I’m very stubborn and not going to reverse my decision on Twitter. If ADN fails I’ll blog more.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The stubbornness deserves a little more explanation. Because programmers are pretty opinionated folks. When we feel strongly about an approach — to languages, to UI design, to backend architectures, anything — we’ll plant our feet in the ground and argue with coworkers about the right way to do things. And it’s easy to dig in, start coming up with more justifications for a choice before taking a second look and seeing if it’s actually the right thing, or whether we’re just fighting for something because we want to get our way.</p>
<p>I put a lot of thought into no longer posting to Twitter. I often bring up my low Twitter user ID (#897) because I think it helps underscore that I’ve been on the service a long time. I get the history of it. I was there when it was all done over SMS with my dumb Nokia phone. I had fun with early experiments on the platform, like my sadly abandoned <a href="http://story140.com/">@story140 account</a>, my <a href="http://wiitransfer.com/codes/">@wii codes service</a>, the <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker API</a>, and of course the two products I continue to support to this day: <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>.</p>
<p>I stopped posting because at some point the anti-developer attitude at Twitter became too much. The limits on user auth tokens, which have already killed a few popular third-party Twitter apps; the problems with shutting down IFTTT recipes; the guidelines that restricted how you could use your own tweets. This is all fairly well documented and I’ve written about it before. I leave my personal account silent as a small protest.</p>
<p>I knew leaving would be difficult, so I set up a series of posts to discourage my future self from ever joining again. <a href="http://watermark.io/collections/manton/myfinaltweets">My final tweets</a> were timed to go out on the anniversary of Steve Jobs’s death. They’re a collected moment, a tribute to both Steve and how great Twitter could be. I like that they’re forever pinned at the top of my profile page.</p>
<p>The best programmers aren’t so proud that they won’t admit when they’re wrong. There’s a time to fight for what you believe in — your coworkers don’t agree with how you want to build that feature, but maybe they just don’t see it clearly yet — and there is a time to admit you made the wrong call and move on. Saying “I was wrong, let’s do it your way” is a powerful statement and moves a project forward. I never want to ignore Twitter just because I’m so stubborn I refuse to admit I overreacted and that it’s time to crawl back to Twitter and accept defeat.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: <em>I wasn’t wrong</em>. Every reason I gave above for leaving Twitter is still valid. I have friends at Twitter doing great work — it’s truly incredible what they’ve built, from scaling the backend to how the iOS app works — but Twitter is too big and successful to change now. We can’t rewind the clock to when Twitter was a tiny company that cared more about developers than advertisers, so I won’t be back.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Right after publishing <a href="../../../2014/04/write_locally_mirror.html">yesterday’s post on mirroring content</a>, I added a link to IndieWebCamp’s <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">POSSE</a>, a project from Tantek Çelik to provide a framework for mirroring posts to different services. It looks like that group is doing great work to identify microformats that will make this a more open standard.</p>
<p>Noah Read also rolled his own solution for writing posts on his site first and then letting them flow to Twitter, App.net, Flickr, and other services. He calls them <a href="http://noahread.net/blog/snippets">Snippets</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Microblogging and social sharing will survive, whether or not the current players do. So I wanted to take control of the things I publish on these networks, without abandoning the great things only they can provide, the conversations and reactions to what is shared. So Snippets are the way I will post to these services from now on.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Check out <a href="http://noahread.net/snippets">Noah’s snippets feed</a>. I especially like the name. As a programmer I’m used to thinking “code snippet” when I hear it, but with enough use it’d be easy to reclaim its normal non-code definition.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/a-eulogy-for-twitter/361339/">The Atlantic has an interesting essay</a> on whether Twitter is on a slow decline, less useful and meaningful than it once was:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Twitter is the platform that led us into the mobile Internet age. It broke our habit of visiting individual news homepages first thing in the morning, and established behaviors built around real-time news consumption and production. It normalized mobile publishing power. It changed our expectations about how we congregate around shared events. Twitter has done for social publishing what AOL did for email. But nobody has AOL accounts anymore.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It reminds me of something I brought up on Core Intuition a few months back, wondering if Twitter is a core part of the web, something that would be with us forever, or if it is “just another web site”. When we get into the groove of using a new service for a few years, it’s easy to forget that web sites don’t have a very good track record. Giant sites like Facebook and Tumblr seem to have been with us forever, but my personal blog is older than both.</p>
<p>Think about this: if it’s even <em>possible</em> for Twitter to fail — not likely, just possible — then why are we putting so much of our content there first, where there are <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms">rules for how tweet text can be used</a>? Storage for all tweets is so massive that there’s no guarantee that other companies will be able to take over the archive if the service has to fold. It’s why I built <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a> to archive and publish tweets.</p>
<p>Decentralization is the internet’s greatest strength and weakness. There shouldn’t be <a href="https://medium.com/">one service</a> to hold all of blogging; each writer should have his or her own domain and web site. But web sites also die all the time from neglect. We need centralized services to index and syndicate content so that it’s <a href="../../../2012/07/permanence.html">preserved</a> and accessible to more people.</p>
<p>Longevity is the next great challenge for the web. All of my work on Riverfold apps is leading this way, from archiving tweets, to <a href="http://sunlit.io/">curating and publishing your best photos</a>, to <a href="http://searchpath.io/">indexing a copy of the text and HTML from your blog</a>. But I’m just one guy with a limited server budget.</p>
<p>It’s time for a new web standard — a metadata format and API that describes how to mirror published content. Maybe it’s part of <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/POSSE">IndieWebCamp</a>? When I write on my blog, I want the content to flow to GitHub Pages, to the Internet Archive, to Medium. When I post photos, I want the content to flow to Dropbox, to S3, to Flickr. It’s not enough to backup or copy data blindly; the source must point to each mirror, and each mirror service must understand who the creator is and how to find the original data if it still exists.</p>
<p>Unlike a distributed platform that works at the level of raw data, like BitTorrent, this new system should work natively with well-understood common files: text, photos, video, and the glue (usually HTML, Markdown, or JSON) that makes a collection meaningful. Instead of yet another generic sync system, it’s a platform that understands publishing, with adapters to flow content into each mirror’s native storage.</p>
<p>If you accept that this is something worth doing, then every place we put our content must be classified as either an original source or a mirror. And this brings us back to Twitter. Because while I think the next 5 years for Twitter will be strong, I’m not convinced that it will last 50 years. Therefore, Twitter cannot be an original source of data; it must be just one of several mirrors for micro-blogging.</p>

			<p>I was talking to friends this week about app advertising, and it inspired me to try Twitter ads. Otherwise known as “promoted tweets”, these ads are actual tweets that show up in search results and timelines, even if the user isn’t following your account. <a href="../../../2014/04/tweet_library_25.html">Tweet Library 2.5</a> seemed like the perfect time to try this.</p>
<p>I set a max of $5 a day and included several related Twitter accounts to help the ads find a more narrow audience of people who might want to buy Tweet Library. Here are the results after 24 hours:</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/2014/promoted_tweets_dashboard.png" width="600" height="367" alt="Promoted tweets dashboard" border="0" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t have an easy way to track this all the way to actual App Store sales. Assuming a 5% conversion on App Store visits, I likely lost a little money. The extra 1800 impressions is nice though, to raise awareness about the app. I’m going to let it run for a week.</p>

			<p>Two great blog posts yesterday from Brent Simmons that I think are related, though I read one early in the day and the other catching up on RSS feeds late at night. First, <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/12/12/one_year_anniversary">on quitting his job</a> to work full-time on Vesper:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “A year ago I was a designer for an enterprise app I didn’t care about — or even like in the least tiny bit — and which you’ve never seen or heard of. That’s no way to live.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It reminds me, of course, of the famous Steve Jobs quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: ‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’ And whenever the answer has been ‘No’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And then, <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/12/12/the_stream">Brent says about Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The 140-character stream is where things not worth saying, and not worth reading, thrive. It’s where things actually worth saying get over-simplified and then get lost, if they get said at all.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, do something you care about, write something lasting. The older I get, the more both of these resonate with me. And even though I haven’t posted to Twitter in over a year, I think I needed to read that post to focus back on this blog, where my writing should live.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>If you’ve read my blog posts about Tweet Marker over the years, including <a href="../../../2013/07/announcing_the_tweet.html">this one when introducing a paid plan</a>, you might hear a little indecision on the right path forward. I’ve run it more like a community service and less like a business, and admittedly the window for turning it into a profitable endeavor has slipped away. But I still want to make the service work well and improve it.</p>
<p>After vacationing this week leading up to Thanksgiving, I finally realized I need to remove the support burden of giving out free access. Starting today, Tweet Marker will transition to a paid-only service. To make this easier, I’ve introduced a less expensive $25/month plan for smaller developers. (Previously the only choice was $75/month, which is now the top tier plan with unlimited active users.)</p>
<p>This solves the problem of automating access to the API. Instead of having to manually fulfill API keys so that developers could try out Tweet Marker, which usually meant weeks or months of delay until I could get to it, by signing up online, developers get immediate access to the API without having to wait on me.</p>
<p>In the short term, this change means that new apps must subscribe before using the API. In the long run, all existing apps should also transition to a paid plan. I haven’t set a hard deadline for existing apps yet, but will work with developers over the coming months to do so.</p>
<p>You can learn more at <a href="https://api.tweetmarker.net/developers/">tweetmarker.net/developers/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> To be clear, this post is only for developers. There&#8217;s a <a href="https://api.tweetmarker.net/subscribe">$1/month subscription</a> for end users but it is optional.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>My account in Watermark right now has 805,182 searchable tweets stored in it — tweets from everyone in my timeline, App.net posts, favorites, and of course my own tweets. When I launched the service, I wasn’t sure how long I’d be able to keep storing these. I initially promised 1-2 months, then upped it to 3 months, and then 6.</p>
<p>Today I’m happy to announce that I have a more formal system in place for storage. The default $4/month plan will officially increase to 1 full year, storing every tweet from anyone in your timeline starting when you sign up. Your own tweets and favorites are kept forever.</p>
<p>If 1 year isn’t long enough, there’s a new unlimited plan for $10/month. Every tweet or App.net post in the system for your account will be kept forever. After a year or two it becomes a really massive and interesting search database, tailored just to your account.</p>
<p>The new tiered plans are live now for new accounts, and I’ll be rolling out a method for switching between plans for current customers soon. You can <a href="http://watermark.io/">learn more about Watermark here</a>.</p>

								</header><!-- .entry-header -->

				<div class="entry-content">
			<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/08/the-great-app-net-mistake/">Mat Honan wrote an article for Wired</a> about App.net. It does a great job of capturing the history of App.net and why it’s different from Twitter. And it’s positive for all but the closing paragraph, which is either discouraging or a wake-up call, depending on your optimism. I recommend reading the whole thing.</p>
<p>Here’s what Mat says about what’s missing:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “But there’s still something missing, that seems totally obvious: a game. App.net needs a <em>Dots</em> or a <em>Candy Crush</em> or a <em>Words With Friends</em> that plugs into its social sphere. Something that isn’t just useful, but fun. Something wonderful.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>App.net does need a hit, a new kind of app that doesn’t resemble Twitter. If that turns out to be a game, then great. But I don’t think it has to be. There are hundreds or maybe thousands of games in the App Store that are excellent but which never made it big. The success of App.net can’t be pinned to such an uphill battle.</p>
<p>I do know one thing: the next great app for App.net will come from the App.net community, the developers who are passionate about the API’s potential, just as early developers like <a href="http://iconfactory.com/">Iconfactory</a> who took a risk on Twitter 6 years ago are still having an impact on that service today. The next great app will come from the developers who see App.net as a way to build new things.</p>
<p>I’m working on an app like that. It uses the App.net API, but not the timeline. It takes pictures, but isn’t really a photo app. It integrates with <a href="http://ohaiapp.net/">Ohai</a>, but isn’t another location check-in app. It renders beautiful maps throughout, but isn’t about navigation. Some of the features I’m most proud of in the app wouldn’t be the same without App.net.</p>
<p>There’s no way to know what apps will resonate with the mainstream, and which will remain niche or failures. But to have any hope of success, you have to start. You might even have to take a risk on a new platform if you want to build something new.</p>
<p>The promise of App.net is bigger than one type of app. App.net isn’t just a blank slate; it’s an amplifier. It’s waiting to power the next new idea and help it grow into something big.</p>

			<p>I love <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/7/8/the-architecture-twitter-uses-to-deal-with-150m-active-users.html">this detailed write-up of the Twitter backend</a> as it exists today. Sending a tweet to your followers uses a massive Redis cluster with a couple terabytes of RAM:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Let’s say you tweet and you have 20K followers. What the fanout daemon will do is look up the location of all 20K users inside the Redis cluster. Then it will start inserting the Tweet ID of the tweet into all those lists throughout the Redis cluster. So for every write of a tweet as many as 20K inserts are occurring across the Redis cluster.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>A listener of <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> asked me today if I had second thoughts about no longer using Twitter, especially since I still maintain a Twitter app. We’ll discuss this on a future episode, but the short answer is: no, I don’t regret it. I have a huge amount of respect for what Twitter has built at a technical level, and for the opportunities it gives people to communicate. I just don’t like their attitude toward developers.</p>
