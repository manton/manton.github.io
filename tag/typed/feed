				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/07/microblogging-with-typed-com.html">Last week I mentioned</a> Typed.com and Elliot Jackson’s tips in the Realmac forums for posting via Drafts and Editorial. Now Elliot has expanded his solution <a href="http://casualnotebook.com/posts/microblogging-with-typedcom">into a full blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The gist of it is that your post, written in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id905337691?at=1l3vn5T">Drafts</a>, gets sent to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8&amp;at=1l3vn5T">Editorial</a> which will take care of the publishing part thanks to it’s ability to run Python and Javascript scripts in it’s built in browser. The post could be both written and published from Editorial, but as nearly everything I do on my phone runs through Drafts anyway, it made sense for this to too.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been using Editorial as my default iOS text editor for a while. I have a “Notes” folder on Dropbox that I use like Simplenote, but driven from <a href="http://www.selfcoded.com/justnotes/">Justnotes</a> on the Mac and accessible via Editorial or any iOS editor. But I’ve just barely scratched the surface of what is possible with Editorial. It’s one of those rare apps that is fine for new users, but which also contains a great depth of features when you’re ready to explore underneath the initial layer of its UI.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://realmacsoftware.com/blog/typed-indiegogo">Typed.com</a> from Realmac Software looks great. Set to launch later this year, crowdfunding for the project has already passed $67k.</p>
<p>Ben Thompson wrote recently about <a href="http://stratechery.com/2015/bloggings-bright-future/">how blogging has changed</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Twitter has replaced link-posts and comments, Instagram has replaced pictures, and Facebook has replaced albums and blogrolls; now Medium is seeking to replace the essay. None of this is a bad thing: literally <em>billions</em> more people now have a much simpler way to express themselves online thanks to the ease-of-use that is characteristic of any service that seeks to focus on one particularly aspect of communication, a big contrast to a blog’s ability to do anything and everything relatively poorly.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a good post, although I’d say that even if those changes aren’t “a bad thing”, they can have bad <em>consequences</em>. Medium is a beautifully designed site and there is some great writing published there. But if it discourages people from owning their own content and writing at their own domain name, then it is a step back for the web. The best use of Medium is to cross-post there, to expand your audience, but not as the primary location for your writing.</p>
<p>If you’ve read between the lines on my posts <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">about microblogging</a> and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/10/return-to-open-apis.html">open APIs</a>, you may have guessed that I’ve also been working on a blog platform, although (I think) of a much different kind than Realmac’s Typed.com. I believe we need more blog platforms, not fewer. Accepting that Twitter and Facebook are the only way to publish online is like collapsing all the publishing systems down to a couple centralized tools. That approach is convenient in the short term but ultimately bad for the web.</p>
<p>The best and most diverse writing on the web still happens on individually-owned blogs. It’s linked to from Twitter, but it originates on blogs. If you’re not blogging than your writing doesn’t have the reach, doesn’t have the permanence, doesn’t have the impact that it could have.</p>
<p>And 2015 is going to be great for blogging. I’m looking forward to trying Typed.com and also sharing some of what I’ve been working on. If you want an early heads-up, <a href="http://eepurl.com/6vVvj">sign up on the announcement mailing list</a>.</p>
