				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best blog posts we write are as much for ourselves as for our readers. That&#8217;s one of the traits that makes personal blogging so special.</p>
<p>I published <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/10/a-great-developer-can-come-from-anywhere.html">my essay last week</a> from the hotel at <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/conference">Release Notes</a>, right before heading downstairs as the conference got underway. Almost no one had read it yet, but the essay still helped me because it made me even more aware of when I accidentally monopolized a conversation. I did end up talking a lot about my new project while at Release Notes, but I also caught myself many times, making sure to turn the conversation around and <em>listen</em>.</p>
<p>And there was plenty to hear at Release Notes. I got something out of every talk and from many conversations with developers who I had never met before. Congratulations to Charles and Joe for putting together a great conference.</p>
<p>Highlights for me included Myke Hurley&#8217;s opening talk on Wednesday night about quitting his job and the first full-time year of <a href="http://www.relay.fm/">Relay FM</a>; Rob Rhyne&#8217;s fantastic whirlwind tour of accounting, which scared me a little because of everything I still don&#8217;t know about being independent; Jean MacDonald&#8217;s talk about podcast sponsorships and the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/appcamp4girls">fundraiser for App Camp for Girls</a>; Pieter Omvlee&#8217;s advice on aiming to build a bigger business; and David Smith&#8217;s talk, which I&#8217;ll get to later. I could pull out lessons from each of these talks as well as the others from Rachel Andrew, Georgia Dow, John Saddington, Chris Liscio, Daniel Pasco, and Jim Dalrymple.</p>
<p>Thursday night was the &#8220;dine around&#8221;, a clever idea to split attendees into groups of about a dozen people, each meeting for dinner at an assigned restaurant. It&#8217;s easy to fall into cliques at conferences. This was a great solution to mixing it up, all but guaranteeing that you&#8217;ll meet someone new.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth saying something about the venue. Converted from the Indianapolis Union Station, which was built in 1853, the conference center and hotel served as a beautiful backdrop to the conference. My hotel room was even made from an old train car. As we left the conference center late Friday afternoon, I took another look up at the vaulted ceiling and stained glass windows, making a mental note to read more about <a href="http://www.walkindianapolis.org/union.html">the history of the original train station</a>.</p>
<p>On Saturday I checked out of the hotel, walked up to <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/bee-coffee-roasters/51ae6176498ee875488bf40d">Bee Coffee Roasters</a> (where I ran into a couple other attendees who were also still processing everything we learned at the conference), and then took an Uber to the airport. My driver was a musician; he had toured the country playing with bands, was working on a soundtrack which he played on CD for me, and had such an optimistic take on the world that it struck me in obvious contrast to the negativity we see online sometimes.</p>
<p>And he said something that stayed with me even longer while I waited at airport security and for my flight to board. He said that everything he had wanted to do in life, he had done. Sure, he&#8217;d love to tour with another band, he&#8217;d love to find success with his new music. But already he was content. He laughed when he said he could die happy, and he was not old.</p>
<p>David Smith mentioned in his talk at Release Notes that he used to want to do everything. Have a best selling app, win a design award, be admired by his peers, and other goals that many of us share. It was only when he set out with a more singular focus — judging every decision by whether it moved his business forward so he could continue to support his family — that all the other secondary goals started taking care of themselves as well. It was a great talk and something I needed to hear.</p>
<p>As a community we&#8217;re ambitious. We want to build something amazing and we want to make a positive impact on the world. But this week was also a reminder to me that it&#8217;s okay to be more focused, to tackle niche vertical apps, or make small boring decisions that will help our business. It&#8217;s okay, even as we want to do more, to slow down and be proud and content with the path that we&#8217;re on.</p>
