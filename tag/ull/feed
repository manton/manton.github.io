				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week my Instagram timeline included a bunch of really beautiful photos from folks in Ireland for Úll. <a href="http://sixcolors.com/2015/03/notes-and-podcasts-from-ireland/">Jason Snell writes</a> about the conference:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The location, in Killarney in county Kerry, is spectacular. It’s rainy and windy and the different patterns on the surface of the lake right outside the hotel are beautiful to watch.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>There were a lot of neat ideas for Úll that I bet made it special, including <a href="http://2015.ull.ie/site/blog/childrenstrack">a kids track</a> and the <a href="http://2015.ull.ie/site/blog/the-ull-train-is-a-coming">train ride</a>. I’m a sucker for anything train related, for example the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/conference/#venue">train car hotel rooms</a> in the upcoming Release Notes conference venue.</p>
<p>These special touches transform a conference into half work, half vacation. Every technical thing you might want to learn is on the internet these days anyway. Conferences should be about inspiration as much as anything else, and a great setting is part of that.</p>
<p><a href="http://sixcolors.com/link/2015/04/tickets-still-available-for-yosemite-conference/">Here’s Jason again</a>, writing about the national park location for Yosemite CocoaConf:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “As I just experienced at Úll in Ireland, these sorts of conferences are truly special. It’s a chance for a small group of people who share an interest in Apple and related technologies to spend a few days together. They’re always a blast, but add in the unique setting of Yosemite National Park and this one promises to be that much more amazing.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry to miss that one. For the last several years I’ve mostly fallen into a pattern of traveling to attend just one non-WWDC conference a year. This year I’ll be <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/session/details/649">speaking at CocoaConf in Austin</a> and hope to make <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/conference/">Release Notes</a> as well. Tickets for CocoaConf are on sale now, and Release Notes tickets should be announced soon.</p>
