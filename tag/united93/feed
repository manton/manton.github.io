				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first heard about the &#8220;United 93 movie&#8221;:http://www.united93movie.com/ I had just about the &#8220;same reaction as Matthew Haughey&#8221;:http://a.wholelottanothing.org/2006/04/buzzplant_none.html. Hollywood only wants to make some quick cash off of other people&#8217;s tragedy. The movie is going to be painful to watch, it won&#8217;t be accurate anyway, and it will be full of sappy, exaggerated nonsense meant to pull at our emotions and our wallets.</p>
<p>I probably said about as much to my television. I only watch a couple hours of TV a week, and a significant portion of that is yelling at advertisements or the local news crew.</p>
<p>But then a few things changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>I heard that the desire to make this movie was more driven by the director than executives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reviews coming in seemed &#8220;very positive&#8221;:http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/united_93/.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I realized that I couldn&#8217;t ignore this movie just because of my overwhelming fear of flying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I remembered that after September 11th, <em>I wanted to make a film about it too</em>. (My story was not a &#8220;docu-drama&#8221;, but a short animated film with a fantasy spin on real events in New York City.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, I saw the movie Friday night. As surprising as it may seem, it is very good. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll say anymore than that.</p>
