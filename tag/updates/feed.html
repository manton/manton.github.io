				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Centralized app update notifications on the iPhone were a great idea, right? Turns out, maybe not. My App Store icon has a &#8220;26&#8221; badge on it. I have no idea which apps have a new version available until I click and scroll through the list, or use iTunes. The reality is that at least 3/4 of them are for apps I downloaded but don&#8217;t use very often. I now have to set aside some time to weed through this list of apps.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d much rather get a friendly reminder of a new version when I launch the app itself &mdash; maybe even outside the app&#8217;s control, near the top of the screen just like when a phone call is in the background. There are a few apps I use every day that were updated weeks ago, but I continued to use an old version because the notification was lost in the noise of dozens of other junk apps.</p>
