				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was looking for a different old post in my archives, and stumbled on this one: <a href="http://www.manton.org/2010/09/i_hope_iad.html">&#8220;I hope iAd fails&#8221;</a>, which I wrote 5 years ago this month. One of my points was that we had a healthy marketplace in the App Store for normal people to actually pay for apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Do we really want to give that marketplace up? Because once it’s gone, and iAds are the norm, it will be an uphill battle to get anyone to pay for anything.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Fast-forward 5 years to today, and well, we&#8217;re on that hill right now. Except there&#8217;s a landslide and I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s going to get buried.</p>
<p>On the <a href="http://www.relay.fm/upgrade/55">Upgrade podcast</a>, Jason Snell and Myke Hurley talked about whether iOS 9&#8217;s Apple News was relevant: what problems is it solving, if any, and — because it will feature unblockable ads powered by iAd — how does it fit into the larger issue of blocking web ads and closed platforms? The discussion starts about <a href="https://overcast.fm/+DeCmyFudI/1:02:18">an hour in</a>.</p>
<p>(If you&#8217;ve used Apple News already, you may not have even seen any ads yet. But Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/">page on Apple News Format</a> makes it clear that they will be encouraging iAd for publishers: &#8220;Monetization is made simple with iAd&#8221;.)</p>
<p>I stand by the opinion that iAd is a mistaken strategy. Apple, if you&#8217;re serious about <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/17/9338963/welcome-to-hell-apple-vs-google-vs-facebook-and-the-slow-death-of-the-web">this fight with Google</a>, go all-in on the fight and abandon iAd. It seems hypocritical to attack web ads while rolling out your own news platform with ads that can&#8217;t be blocked.</p>
