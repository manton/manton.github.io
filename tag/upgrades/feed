				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brent Simmons has a pair of posts on <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/02/07/dropping_support_for_older_os_releases">dropping support for older OS releases</a> and <a href="http://inessential.com/2014/02/07/more_about_not_supporting_older_os_relea">how the upgraded percentage goes up quickly</a>:</p>
