				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have no problems with USB-C on the new MacBook Pro. It will be a small headache at the beginning, for sure. But because it&#8217;s a standard there&#8217;s no long-term compatibility risk the way there is with removing the 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p>More on that below. First, Marco Arment <a href="https://marco.org/2016/11/02/design-for-the-present">doesn&#8217;t think using USB-C exclusively is very practical</a> in a pro laptop:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  A pro laptop released today should definitely have USB-C ports — <em>mostly</em> USB-C ports, even — but it should also have at least one USB-A port.
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/11/02/design-for-the-future">John Gruber responds</a> that Apple&#8217;s strategy is to speed up adoption:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  They design for the future, and in doing so, they bring the future here faster. In the alternate universe where the new MacBook Pros ship with one USB-A port, the transition to ubiquitous USB-C peripherals and cables will happen at least a little slower.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with that. But then he closes with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I’m not saying Marco is wrong. I’m just saying Apple’s not wrong either. It’s the same trade-off with the iPhone 7 headphone jack.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the same at all. It&#8217;s a convenient narrative to group together both the migration away from USB-A and the one away from 3.5mm headphones. There are important differences, though.</p>
<p>USB-C is a standard that is already used in many devices from different vendors. It will become universal. The immediate replacement for the 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7 is the Lightning EarPods which come in the box. Lightning is a proprietary cable that will never be used in non-Apple phones, and in fact is not even used on Macs.</p>
<p>You can argue that more and more people will use Bluetooth headphones, but I doubt they will be as common as wired headphones for many years, and there&#8217;s no guarantee that an all-wireless future will <em>ever</em> arrive. There is a very clear migration from USB-A to USB-C. The move to Lightning headphones and Bluetooth is much more complicated and not directly comparable.</p>
