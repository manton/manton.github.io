				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2014/05/24/what_happened_at_userland">Brent Simmons has another expanded résumé</a> of sorts, following his post about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/05/newsgator_and_sepia.html">working at NewsGator</a>. I love this write-up because it mirrors a lot of the work I was doing, so it brings back a lot of memories. I was actively using Frontier for client work and <a href="http://www.manton.org/archive/idiom/mactivity_presentation/">crazy side projects</a>; one of my co-workers for a time was Mason Hale, who built an early CGI framework for Frontier; and I loosely worked with Dave Winer to help run the frontier-talk mailing list and hack on a potential WebSTAR plug-in for Frontier. (Though I was still a pretty poor C programmer back then. Someone else ended up shipping it.)</p>
<p>Back when the job description “webmaster” still meant something, I worked for the WebEdge conference which brought together the best web developers for the Mac OS. WebEdge hosted <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1996/09/12/MidnightPlanetoWindows.html">the first meeting of the Macintosh Internet Developer Association</a> (MIDAS), led in part by Dave Winer. And I was always playing with the tools that came out of Userland, from Manilla to Radio Userland. I used Radio to run this blog <a href="http://www.manton.org/2004/03/thank_you.html">until 2004</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the developers from that time have faded away, moved on to other projects away from the public spotlight. But not Brent. He just shipped <a href="http://vesperapp.co/blog/vesper-2-0-and-vesper-sync/">Vesper 2.0</a> and it’s some of his best work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Brent Simmons is still looking&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2009/03/07/still_looking_for_a_version_control_syst for the perfect version control system:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People talk about how wonderful are features like re-writing history &mdash; and I read that stuff and think, &#8216;Wow, Git&#8217;s really cool and powerful.&#8217; But then I know it could suck me in and take away time from _real_ work. It&#8217;s _already_ more work &mdash; _for me_ &mdash; than when using Subversion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t used Git much since Daniel and I discussed it on an early &#8220;Core Intuition&#8221;:http://www.coreint.org/ episode. Like Brent I just don&#8217;t see a big win for single-person projects, although it&#8217;s fascinating to watch how open source projects are using &#8220;Github&#8221;:http://github.com/.</p>
<p>I like what Brent did a few months ago with his blog redesign, how both inessential.com and ranchero.com complement each other. He also wrote &#8220;more about his publishing system&#8221;:http://inessential.com/2009/01/30/new_publishing_system_tour_of_my_head, including a bit in passing about the tool I used to start my blog, Radio Userland.</p>
<p>I mention it because this blog is 7 years old today. Happy birthday to manton.org.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wow, <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2003/01/01#When:4:59:33PM">Dave Winer is applying for a new job</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As I&#8217;ve been talking with people about this, it&#8217;s been hard for them to separate me from UserLand, but that&#8217;s what I want to do. I&#8217;m going to get a new job with a new title, and it&#8217;s going to be quite different from being the CEO of a commercial software company. It&#8217;s time to set my life in a new direction.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Good luck, Dave. <i>Still digging!</i> :-)</p>
