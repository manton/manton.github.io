				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After blogging every day for a couple weeks at the end of July, I decided to take a break while my family and I took a vacation to London and Paris over the last 10 days. Instead we kept a private-ish travel blog of the trip. It&#8217;s similar to what I might post in a private journal (handwritten or <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a>), but accessible to family in a richer &#8220;own your own content&#8221; way than just Facebook photos.</p>
<p>I also posted 7 photos throughout the trip to <a href="https://instagram.com/manton">my Instagram account</a>. I like to use Instagram to capture just the very best photo from something, so the timeline never feels overloaded. Of course we took hundreds of photos overall. Some went to the trip blog, some went to Instagram and Facebook, some went to Snapchat (teenagers!), and the rest we&#8217;ll sort through as we have time. We had wi-fi in the apartments and so I made sure everything was synced up to Dropbox at least once a day.</p>
<p>I worked a little while traveling, but could only be so productive without getting in the way of enjoying the vacation. I&#8217;m catching up on some email and client work this morning. Feeling fairly rested despite a very long travel day coming back home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No, I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;Dave Winer&#8217;s thoughts&#8221;:http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/riverOfNews on RSS reader design exactly, although that&#8217;s part of it. It&#8217;s more the way we in the technology community interact with the world. Hundreds of news feeds, company chat, external IRC channels, private AIM, email dinging every 5 minutes, and the constant flow of tweets. At home, we&#8217;re connected essentially 24/7; on the road, the iPhone brings it all with us. Plus there&#8217;s the never-ending pile of work to do on too many projects.</p>
<p>Technology news or politics or development moves too fast and doesn&#8217;t slow down. It&#8217;s easy to feel like you&#8217;re being pulled down the river, one hand struggling to hold on to the raft and the other deep in the current, information overload all around.</p>
<p>Since coming back from C4 I&#8217;d been fighting a cold, which developed into a cough and sinus infection and fever and whatever worse. I finally hit the doctor up last week and just unplugged, checking email twice a day for emergencies only. I spent the rest of the day sleeping, reading, and with family &mdash; a self-imposed vacation for my brain as much as my body.</p>
<p>Four days later I&#8217;m feeling quite a bit better, and trying to think about what changes to make in my schedule so as to not wind up insane or dead before I&#8217;m 35. But even as I say that I acknowledge that it&#8217;s stretching the truth, because I&#8217;ve never been happier.</p>
