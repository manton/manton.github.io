				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started writing this post yesterday afternoon. Worried that I would jinx a victory, I wrote two versions: one for a narrow loss and one for what really happened.</p>
<p>Two years ago, after Kerry lost, &#8220;I wrote&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2004/11/after_almost_winning.html: &#8220;We almost won, and all the hard work of the last 18 months will pay off big in two short years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s two years later, and we did it. DNC chairman Howard Dean&#8217;s &#8220;50-state strategy&#8221;:http://democrats.org/a/party/a_50_state_strategy/ worked. The media will tell you that the election was just about Iraq and Bush, but it goes deeper than that &#8212; voters are sick of Republican corruption, tired of half-hearted attempts at health care, and longing for a real vision for public education. You can see the patterns by looking at the progressive wins in state races and on local propositions too.</p>
<p>There are &#8220;20 posts in the politics category&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/category/politics.html of my blog, and they include some of my favorites from the last 4 years. It&#8217;s nice to be on the winning side again after too long. The next part of the job is for Democrats to show everyone in America that real progress can be made in Washington. Deliver. Then keep organizing and make it all happen again in 2008.</p>
