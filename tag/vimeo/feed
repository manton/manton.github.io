				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week I looked at the SVN log for my application in development and realized that I had started it exactly 1 year ago. While I wasn&#8217;t actively working on it every day or week during that time, that&#8217;s still a very long time for me to work on an application before shipping it. I knew I had to call the 1.0 done and push it out.</p>
<p>I was falling into that infinite 1.0 cycle where I could continue to improve the application forever without releasing it. The sooner I noticed that trap, the sooner I was able to correct course and get the app into the hands of real users.</p>
<p>The app is called &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/. It&#8217;s for importing, tagging, and uploading home movies. I have high hopes for the app and a lot of fun stuff planned for the future.</p>
<p>As usual, a lot of people talked about the product even before I did. My thanks to Dan Moren of Macworld for &#8220;covering the launch&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/140376/2009/05/clipstart.html before I even had a chance to spam him with a press release; to John Gruber for &#8220;posting about how he uses it&#8221;:http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/05/04/clipstart; and to &#8220;Duncan Davidson&#8221;:http://journal.duncandavidson.com/post/102477678/clipstart and &#8220;Mike Zornek&#8221;:http://blog.clickablebliss.com/2009/05/04/clipstart-10/ for their write-ups. I also very much appreciate &#8220;all the retweets&#8221;:http://search.twitter.com/search?q=clipstart and goodwill from my friends on Twitter. Those meant a lot.</p>
