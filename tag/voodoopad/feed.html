				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">VoodooPad 5</a> is out this weekend, with a new file format that plays nicely with Dropbox. <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/blog/archives/2012/04/voodoopad_5.0_released.html">Gus Mueller says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “No more connecting to WebDAV servers and having to deal with authentication issues and strange HTTP errors. Now you can just put your VoodooPad 5 document in a Dropbox folder and VP will detect when pages have been updated.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is another good example of where web APIs like Dropbox can be <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/04/icloud_vs_the_web.html">more useful than iCloud</a>. Multiple people can collaborate on a VoodooPad document, and the direct download and Mac App Store copies of VoodooPad can sync together.</p>
<p>Also new in version 5 is native support for Markdown and an ePub export option. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2007/01/falling_in_love.html">The workflow for help documentation</a> that I posted <em>5 years ago</em> carries over to VoodooPad 5 just fine, too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Somehow it&#8217;s been a couple years since I wrote about &#8220;using VoodooPad for authoring help&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/2007/01/falling_in_love.html. I always meant to update the post with more information, and I still receive occasional follow-up emails from developers who are trying this for themselves. My workflow is virtually unchanged since then, and the help for &#8220;Clipstart&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/ is built the same way.</p>
<p>Here is the Clipstart VoodooPad document in case it&#8217;s helpful to other developers: &#8220;Clipstart_Help.vpdoc.zip&#8221;:http://manton.org/misc/Clipstart_Help.vpdoc.zip. The important parts are the special pages WebExportPostflightScript and WebExportPageTemplate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, &#8220;Philippe Casgrain wrote a great blog post&#8221;:http://developer.casgrain.com/?p=16 that is nearly identical to what I do, but with more detail and steps for triggering an export from Xcode. Lately I&#8217;ve been pointing people to his post since it&#8217;s more technical than mine was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mark Dalrymple also posted&#8221;:http://borkwarellc.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/voodoopad-and-subversion/ a time-saving SVN script for VoodooPad today. I&#8217;ve been needing this!</p>
<p>VoodooPad is just a really good fit for this stuff. (Also see &#8220;Macworld&#8217;s 4-mice review&#8221;:http://www.macworld.com/article/141473/2009/07/voodoopad41.html for VoodooPad 4.1.) Or if you are more of an OmniOutliner kind of person, check out &#8220;Omni&#8217;s Helpify tool&#8221;:http://blog.omnigroup.com/2008/10/02/helpify-the-omni-help-emitter/ for converting outlines to an Apple help book.</p>

		<title>Falling in love with VoodooPad again</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago I used &#8220;VoodooPad Lite&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/ extensively. Every note, to-do list, and feature description went into it. At some point I migrated away from VoodooPad to a combination of text files and &#8220;Ta-da list&#8221;:http://www.tadalist.com/, perhaps fearing I would have too much data in a weird format that would be difficult to get at later.</p>
<p>But I was always on the lookout for a problem that would best be solved with VoodooPad again. With our localized help files for &#8220;Bookshelf 4.1&#8221;:http://www.vitalsource.com/, I tried for most of a day to use VoodooPad to manage the help. I even experimented with Gus&#8217;s dead &#8220;project for remote wiki editing&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi?space=3ec82d22-c72a-01d9-1639-c0cbe4c4c32b, thinking I would write my own web-based help-specific wiki system and plug &#8220;Boomerang&#8221;:http://www.flyingmeat.com/fs/flystashweb.cgi/348c223e-0512-01da-1c41-c0cbe4c4fc75 into it. In the end it was too difficult to force the existing static help files into VoodooPad.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to a few nights ago. &#8220;Wii Transfer&#8221;:http://www.riverfold.com/software/wiitransfer/ 1.5 has no Apple Help at all, and it needs some. A perfect opportunity for VoodooPad, and I&#8217;m happy to report that the solution works beautifully. I knew I could make it work because clearly VoodooPad&#8217;s own help files are managed with VoodooPad. After a bit of experimentation I bought a new VoodooPad license and all was well in the world.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>I manage the help content in VoodooPad, creating pages for different help sections and generally just typing away and getting stuff done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The HTML export template lives inside the VoodooPad document itself, so everything is in one place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also inside the VoodooPad document is a post-processing script (written in Ruby) that looks for a comment in index.html and inserts the appropriate AppleTitle and AppleIcon meta tags that Apple Help needs to get its work done.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The only part I haven&#8217;t finished yet is that the script should also send the files off to Help Indexer to update the search index. I coded that part but it doesn&#8217;t work yet &#8212; there is something different about how VoodooPad executes these scripts that prevents other applications from launching. (Maybe. I&#8217;ll sort it out eventually.)</p>
<p>You can &#8220;watch a screencast of the process here&#8221;:http://www.manton.org/screencasts/2007/voodoopad.mov. I add a new page, enter some filler text, export the VoodooPad document, then re-run the Xcode project and view the changes in Apple Help. Fun!</p>
