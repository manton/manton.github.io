				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a wonderful video of <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/tech/watch-glen-keane-draw-ariel-and-the-beast-in-3d-119110.html">Glen Keane drawing with VR goggles</a>. I&#8217;ve been watching and listening to Glen explain animation for a long time, on bonus videos going back to my small collection of Disney feature LaserDiscs. It&#8217;s great to see him still in the spotlight after leaving Disney, and the great work he did on last year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9CG_PoEWCg">Duet</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Disney company, I really enjoyed last night&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/waltdisney">American Experience on Walt</a>. Part 2 airs tonight on PBS.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Shortly after posting this, <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/cartoon-brew-pick/nephtali-by-glen-keane-119359.html">a new film</a> from Glen Keane showed up in my newsreader. It&#8217;s a good month for animation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>“Around here, however, we don’t look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things, because we’re curious… and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.” — Walt Disney</em></p>
<p>There are many posts on this blog about Wii Transfer, the little Mac app that launched commercially almost by accident, and convinced me that it would be worthwhile to invest time in this side business called Riverfold Software. Early posts like <a href="http://www.manton.org/2006/12/reintroducing_wii.html">the launch post in 2006</a> or <a href="http://www.manton.org/2007/02/first_75_days.html">this one about the first 75 days</a>, and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2007/09/wii_transfer.html">this one covering the price bump in version 2.5</a>. But the app has been fading over the last couple of years, no longer as relevant today as it once was. It&#8217;s time to let it go.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m retiring Wii Transfer to focus on my other apps. It&#8217;s not that it doesn&#8217;t sell; it still does. It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s not an app I actually use anymore. By officially shelving the whole project, I hope to remove a psychological burden of sorts — to no longer worry that I&#8217;m ignoring an active product.</p>
<p>It also doesn&#8217;t fit into a new theme I have for Riverfold: apps that are all about keeping and remembering what matters. For Clipstart, that&#8217;s family videos. For Tweet Library and Tweet Marker Plus, that&#8217;s old tweets. Wii Transfer is about… listening to music on your Wii? It doesn&#8217;t fit, and in the world of the Apple TV and Roku, modern streaming technology has passed the app by.</p>
<p>If anyone is disappointed that Wii Transfer will no longer receive updates, of course I offer refunds. I won&#8217;t be selling or open sourcing the app, preferring instead to continue to support existing customers myself for as long as they want to use the app. And I&#8217;ll keep the automatic bookmark service running that makes setup easy, as well as the Mii rendering service, so nothing breaks.</p>
<p>I put a lot of work into Wii Transfer over its 5-year lifespan. It&#8217;s not easy saying goodbye, especially to some of the unique things that only Wii Transfer could do, such as exporting Miis as images. Maybe I can bring that back one day. For now, I&#8217;m following the path started by my apps Tweet Library and Clipstart, for which there are many new things still to do.</p>
