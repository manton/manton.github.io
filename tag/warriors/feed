				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the week I posted about WWDC to <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">my microblog</a>, but I thought I&#8217;d write a longer post with the week&#8217;s narrative. It&#8217;s useful to have these to refer to in the future when all the WWDCs blur together and I&#8217;ve forgotten which event was which. Where it adds any details I&#8217;ll link to a few of the shorter posts.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s go back to Sunday morning a week ago when I arrived in San Francisco, ticketless but ready to learn and meet up with friends. What a great day. First burritos and coffee in the Mission, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2676.html">then to Oakland</a> for the NBA finals, game 2. I had signed up on the Golden State Warriors mailing list a couple weeks earlier to get in on the pre-sale tickets. Excepting the nearby San Antonio Spurs, I&#8217;m almost never going to just coincidentally be in the <em>same city</em> as an NBA finals game. I couldn&#8217;t let that chance slip by.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/wwdc_warriors.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="Golden State Warriors" border="0" /></p>
<p>And it was an amazing game. Outwardly I was rooting for the Warriors — high fives to fans when the team came back to force overtime, wearing my new yellow shirt they gave everyone at the game. But inwardly I was also marveling at LeBron&#8217;s dominance and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2678.html">happy to see the series tied up</a>. I want to see this thing go to 7 games.</p>
<p>Monday was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2680.html">the keynote</a> and later the Cartoon Art Museum / NeXT fundraiser, with beautiful art on the wall from one of my favorite films this year, Song of the Sea. Tuesday I tried to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2688.html">catch up on some code</a> at Sightglass Coffee, watch sessions at WeWork, and installed the <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2684.html">iOS 9 beta</a> on my retina iPad Mini. In the evening on this day and others there were parties, though I only attended a few.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/wwdc_talkshow.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="The Talk Show" border="0" /></p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/live/">The Talk Show live</a> with guest Phil Schiller was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2690.html">a great surprise</a>. I&#8217;m so happy for John and his success. Developers who have only known Daring Fireball after it was already fairly popular may need this important reminder: John Gruber started a dozen years ago <em>with a blog that no one read</em>, just like the rest of us, and this week he conducted the best interview of a senior Apple executive I&#8217;ve ever seen. If you think it&#8217;s enough to just throw random quips to Twitter, it&#8217;s not enough. Blogging is still the best way to build an audience. (Don&#8217;t miss <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/06/11/live-with-phil">Marco&#8217;s post</a> about the event and what it means for the new Apple.)</p>
<p>I have very little to complain to Apple about this year. Maybe the keynote was a little long, but the topics they hit and the new user features and APIs were exactly right. I&#8217;ve got Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan installed and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2707.html">will require it for my next Mac app</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/wwdc_bridge.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="Golden State Bridge" border="0" /></p>
<p>Toward the middle of the week I wasn&#8217;t feeling particularly great — not sick, but not really upbeat enough to get excited about new APIs. I escaped the city for the afternoon on Wednesday, visiting the Walt Disney Family Museum and then walking down to Crissy Field toward the Golden Gate Bridge. I stretched my arms out wide to catch the wind and felt refreshed in a way that the stagnant weather back in Austin this time of year can&#8217;t hope to provide. I remember <a href="https://twitter.com/manton/statuses/211946809994653696">this tweet from 2012</a> and it&#8217;s always true again, year after year.</p>
<p>Thursday morning I caught <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2696.html">a session at AltConf</a> before heading to the airport. Flights were delayed out of SFO because of fog, so it was 3 hours waiting in San Francisco, and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2700.html">another 3 hours</a> waiting in Phoenix after a missed connection. But it&#8217;s all good. WWDC was a little weird for me — not because of anything Apple did, just because I was a little wistful, and distracted by email and non-WWDC happenings too.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I&#8217;m inspired by the week. The success of both AltConf and now <a href="http://www.bringyourlayers.com/">Layers</a>, not to mention all the other smaller events and keynote watch parties, point to a very strong WWDC for years to come.</p>
