				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I sent <a href="http://eepurl.com/blcsdv">an email to Watermark customers</a> over the weekend, letting them know that the service as it currently exists will be going away on May 15th. As <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/11/winding-down-my-twitter-apps.html">I wrote about last year</a>, Twitter has improved their search enough that a part of what Watermark is good at is no longer as necessary as it once was. However, I still see interest in Tweet Marker, from developers and users, so I wanted to keep the web-based timeline and sync from Watermark and make it available to all Tweet Marker subscribers.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">learn more about Tweet Marker here</a>. I’ve had to significantly scale out the backend servers this year, including adding a second load balancer, so I’d love your support. The new timeline feature will roll out later in May.</p>
<p>While I’m happy to keep offering a part of Watermark (now back in Tweet Marker), I have less good news for Tweet Library. I’ve found it very difficult to justify the time to finish the new version. It’s now looking likely that the current version will be the last.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m the guest on <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/2014/11/23/226-workflows-with-manton-reece/">this week&#8217;s Mac Power Users podcast</a>. In addition to workflow and apps I use, the discussion went off the rails a little into the Twitter app ecosystem, especially the fact that I no longer post to Twitter yet still have apps like Tweet Library, Watermark, and the Tweet Marker API that depend on Twitter. For the last 2 years this has been an odd decision on my part; I want to do the right thing for my customers, but I&#8217;m increasingly frustrated with life as a third-party Twitter developer.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/building-a-complete-tweet-index">Twitter announced</a> that they&#8217;ve expanded their search index to include the full history of tweets going back to 2006. I was thrilled by this upgrade to the Twitter service. That the search was so limited for so long was the primary reason I built Tweet Library and Watermark to begin with. Unfortunately, this functionality is only for the official Twitter apps. <a href="https://twittercommunity.com/t/search-api-the-new-complete-tweet-index-announcement/27883">It will not be made available</a> to third-party developers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for me to wind down development on my Twitter-related apps. I&#8217;ll continue to sell Tweet Library through the end of 2014, then remove it from the App Store. Watermark will also shut down at that time. Because all the tweets stored in Watermark are public tweets (by design it never supported DMs or protected accounts), I will attempt to make the entire Watermark database archive of millions of tweets available publicly. Existing customers can also sync tweets and collections to Dropbox for personal archiving.</p>
<p>Published collections from Tweet Library or Watermark will be maintained indefinitely. No URLs will break, ever. Updating published collections will also continue to work for anyone who already owns Tweet Library.</p>
<p>I will also continue to host the Tweet Marker API, but starting in January I will be more strict about requiring developers to pay for the service. Many developers have been paying for API access for a year (thank you!), but others have missed or ignored my requests to move to a paid plan. It&#8217;s not fair to the Twitter developers who have been paying for Tweet Marker access if some continue get the API for free.</p>
<p>Many friends have told me over the years that I have <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">too many products</a>. But letting any one product go is not easy. There&#8217;s an implicit promise when shipping software that the developer should maintain and improve it for customers. Stopping development on these apps is the right decision and possibly long overdue, but it&#8217;s still difficult. What gives me hope is that it will let me focus on new projects currently in development, which I couldn&#8217;t be more excited about.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a new update to <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> out today. Major additions include CSV file export to Dropbox and new URL schemes for starting a search, export, or publish. The URL schemes look like this:</p>
<p>twtlib://username/search?q=hello&amp;collection=Favorites</p>
<p>twtlib://username/export?collection=Testing</p>
<p>twtlib://username/publish?collection=Testing</p>
<p>twtlib://username/storify?collection=Testing</p>
<p>There are a few other important bug fixes too, especially to importing the Tweets.zip archive from Twitter.</p>
<p>When I gave up on Twitter as a user, many people asked if I would abandon Tweet Library. I wasn&#8217;t sure at first, but the answer now is a clear &#8220;no&#8221;. In fact, since my last personal tweet in 2012, I&#8217;ve released new features and even redesigned the app for iOS 7.</p>
<p>But I do need to start consolidating my work on Tweet Library and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>, because the apps share so many concepts around archiving and search. To that end, this week I&#8217;m retiring tweetlibrary.com as a way to browse and publish collections. The site will now redirect to a special landing page on Watermark. Published collections from Tweet Library also go to a public page on Watermark.</p>
<p>It was a tough decision to change the tweetlibrary.com URLs, but maintaining separate web apps that are so similar made everything more complicated, holding back what I could build. Having a single web codebase (Watermark) will ultimately let me improve both Tweet Library and Watermark more quickly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My account in Watermark right now has 805,182 searchable tweets stored in it — tweets from everyone in my timeline, App.net posts, favorites, and of course my own tweets. When I launched the service, I wasn’t sure how long I’d be able to keep storing these. I initially promised 1-2 months, then upped it to 3 months, and then 6.</p>
<p>Today I’m happy to announce that I have a more formal system in place for storage. The default $4/month plan will officially increase to 1 full year, storing every tweet from anyone in your timeline starting when you sign up. Your own tweets and favorites are kept forever.</p>
<p>If 1 year isn’t long enough, there’s a new unlimited plan for $10/month. Every tweet or App.net post in the system for your account will be kept forever. After a year or two it becomes a really massive and interesting search database, tailored just to your account.</p>
<p>The new tiered plans are live now for new accounts, and I’ll be rolling out a method for switching between plans for current customers soon. You can <a href="http://watermark.io/">learn more about Watermark here</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My apps <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a> and <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker</a> were recently updated to version 1.1 of Twitter’s API. I’ve also finished the coding changes in Tweet Library to support 1.1, but it has not yet been submitted to Apple. I expect it to be another week while I wrap up a new feature included in the update.</p>
<p>I don’t like having my release schedule dictated by others, but that’s life as a Twitter developer. And why I no longer post there.</p>
<p>This matters today because Twitter is running an API <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/api-v1-retirement-update">blackout test</a>. Tweet Library will not be able to load new tweets this afternoon for about an hour (3pm PST) while v1 is unavailable. I’ll post again here and from <a href="https://alpha.app.net/riverfold">@riverfold on App.net</a> when the new version of Tweet Library is shipped off to Apple and live in the App Store.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the success of Tweet Marker, several people suggested I should build a sync server for RSS. This was last year and earlier this year, before Google Reader officially shut down, but after <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/02/11/rss_sync_apocalypse_preview">it was clear that we needed something better</a>. I jotted down some notes for a couple ideas but ultimately decided not to do it. I’ve already got my hands full with my current shipping products!</p>
<p>Luckily many great developers are now on this. <a href="http://feedwrangler.net/">Feed Wrangler</a> from David Smith, hopes for a <a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2013/03/13/netnewswire-cloud/">possible NetNewsWire Cloud</a>, more <a href="https://twitter.com/shauninman/statuses/312187680832229377">interest in Fever</a>, and other established web apps like <a href="http://www.newsblur.com/">NewsBlur</a> and <a href="http://www.feedly.com/">Feedly</a>.  As Marco Arment said, this <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/03/13/google-reader-sunset">could end up being a great thing</a> for innovation in blogs and RSS again.</p>
<p>But just because I’m going to watch on the sidelines for the server sync part of RSS, doesn’t mean I’m going to completely skip building better RSS support into my own products. There’s a lot I’d like to do with client-side RSS support in Watermark.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I tend to be pretty stubborn about not changing my price. <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> sat at $10 for two years before I finally lowered it, and the price for <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/clipstart/">Clipstart</a> has never changed from the $29 it shipped at. I think there is something to be said for price consistency so that users feel like software is stable and doesn’t have arbitrary value. (Many people disagree with this, which is why I’d classify my opinion as equal parts instinct and stubbornness rather than a proven formula for success.)</p>
<p>But I’m making two pricing changes today: Tweet Library goes up to $7.99, and Watermark down to just $4/month. I’ve come to believe that the previous price changes for both products were too far in either direction. I hope this corrects that. In the case of Watermark, I will eventually be offering different plans at higher tiers for more storage, and want the entry-level price to be as appealing as possible. (All existing Watermark customers have been switched to the discounted plan.)</p>
<p>The little <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/watermark-mobile/id566886320?mt=8">iOS app for Watermark</a> has also been updated to version 1.1 and now features auto-renewing subscriptions. This means you can sign up directly in the iOS app and have your iTunes account charged each month. Watermark Mobile launched mostly as a convenient search interface, but it should now start receiving more regular updates.</p>
<p>For another recent discussion about pricing, check out part 3 of <a href="http://kevinhoctor.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-future-of-software-pricing.html">Kevin Hoctor’s excellent write-up</a> of talks from NSConference.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s great to see more people get access to their full archive of tweets from Twitter. In addition to just having a copy of your own tweets, it can be useful to go back and browse them by date, or search for something specific. I’d suggest putting the HTML version online as-is (<a href="http://www.manton.org/archive/tweets/">mine’s here</a>), and also checking out other apps that add a variety of different features on top of the basic archive.</p>
<p>Both of my apps — <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a> for iOS and <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a> for the web — can now import the .zip file you receive from Twitter. This file contains your full archive of tweets and retweets. Both apps can load the file directly from Dropbox, making it as simple as possible to get the tweets imported. And both apps are smart about only importing tweets that haven’t been stored yet, so you don’t have to worry about duplicates.</p>
<p><strong>To import into Tweet Library</strong>, first download the archive from your settings page on twitter.com. Inside Tweet Library click on the blue arrow icon next to “Archives” and walk through the steps to authorize your account with Dropbox. Then copy the .zip file from Twitter to Dropbox → Apps → Tweet Library. It will show up in Tweet Library and can be selected.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2013/tl_import_flow.png" alt="Tweet Library import flow" border="0" width="540" height="226" /></p>
<p>Tweet Library is good if you want easy access to your tweets on the iPhone or iPad. You can search your tweets, create filters for them, and add tweets to special collections to share with others. It also doubles as a full Twitter client, with a timeline, posting, Instapaper support, and plenty more. Check it out <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweet-library/id365768793?mt=8">in the iOS App Store</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To import into Watermark</strong>, also download the archive from Twitter and put it on Dropbox. You can put it anywhere, either in Apps → Watermark if you’ve already authorized Watermark to use Dropbox (for export), or in Documents or anywhere else. Then sign in to Watermark and click Account → “Upload all your tweets” to select the file.</p>
<p>Watermark is good if you want to expand your archive beyond just your own tweets. It indexes tweets from everyone you are following, creating a huge searchable archive over time. My own account in Watermark now has about 400,000 tweets indexed. Sign up or <a href="http://watermark.io/">learn more at watermark.io</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over three months ago I stopped using Twitter. I wanted to make a statement — perhaps in an overly-dramatic way — that the developer-hostile environment that Twitter had evolved into wasn’t something I could support anymore. I do still read plenty of tweets while testing <a href="http://watermark.io/">Watermark</a>, and I’m almost done with a new version of <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetlibrary/">Tweet Library</a>, because my customers deserve great Twitter features. But I haven’t tweeted, retweeted, or favorited a thing from my personal account since October 5th.</p>
<p>I knew that sometimes it would be difficult to resist going back to Twitter, replying to a question, or cross-posting my posts from App.net. So I set things up to discourage my future self from even considering more tweeting. I picked the 1-year anniversary of the day Steve Jobs died and <a href="http://watermark.io/collections/manton/myfinaltweets">wrote my final tweets</a> a week in advance. If someone visits my profile, I want those statements to be what they see. I can’t tweet again without pushing those tweets from the top of the list.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, App.net started taking off. Netbot shipped. The <a href="http://blog.app.net/2012/09/27/announcing-the-app-net-developer-incentive-program/">developer incentive program</a> started to directly reward developers. There’s a good community there. It’s smaller than on Twitter; there isn’t the same never-ending stream of tweets flowing into your timeline. But maybe that’s a good thing.</p>
<p>The flip side is that it’s hard to let go of things like Twitter that have value. I had similar self-doubt when I killed off my app Wii Transfer, so that I could focus on bigger ideas. But simplifying has allowed me to do some of the best work of my career in 2012. I’ve put everything I have into Watermark, into the new Tweet Marker subscriptions, into doing Core Intuition weekly, into <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/06/ship_everything.html">shipping everything I work on</a>. 2013 is going to be awesome, and I’m not looking back.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since introducing the <a href="http://tweetmarker.net/">Tweet Marker</a> $1/month subscriber plan earlier this week, I’ve received a few questions about how the Safari extension works, and whether Watermark customers will also receive the new features. Yes, Watermark subscribers automatically have access to the Tweet Marker extension, which can be <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetmarker/downloads/TweetMarker_1.1.safariextz">downloaded here</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve prepared a screencast to show how the extension works. It’s about a minute long, and you can <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetmarker/safari.html">view it right here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has already subscribed to either Tweet Marker or Watermark.</p>
