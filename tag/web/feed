				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/workflow-update-brings-ability-to-interact-with-any-web-api/">Federico Viticci has an overview</a> and examples for the latest Workflow for iOS release, which adds more advanced features for calling into web APIs. It looks great:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  For those who are only partially familiar with the terminology, this means that Workflow can communicate with the majority of modern services that come with a web API. If you&#8217;ve never worked with web APIs before, it&#8217;ll take you a few hours of reading and experiments with dictionaries, token authentications, form requests, and file uploads to get the gist of how it works. But, the Workflow team has managed to make what tends to be a visually unintuitive programming task – assembling dictionaries and structuring <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> – as simple and attractive as possible, abstracting many of the complexities that web developers have to deal with in desktop IDEs and command-line tools.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s another nice example of automatically creating GitHub Gists, <a href="https://www.jordanmerrick.com/posts/workflow-and-apis/">from Jordan Merrick</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/f401a725d68c476d8d95a90abcc36b5d">This is a workflow</a> I’ve always wanted to create, and the new API support makes it possible. <a href="https://gist.github.com/discover">Gists</a> are great to share small pieces of text information, such as code snippets or scripts. This action extension workflow accepts files of any type (though they must be text-based) and creates a <a href="https://gist.github.com/jordanmerrick/9f619c0aaffffd5bb46fad71e73e1477">gist</a> using the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/">GitHub API</a>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Workflow can now take over many web tasks that previously required either writing scripts or depending on hosted solutions like IFTTT and Zapier. Like <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/blogging-your-photos.html">my workflow for posting photos to my blog</a>, it&#8217;s a natural tool for web publishing and microblogging.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also love to see a Mac version of Workflow one day. I do some limited automation on my Mac, but AppleScript and Automator aren&#8217;t as easy to use or as well-maintained as Workflow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I subscribe to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/04/17_services_for.html">a lot of web applications</a> for my indie business, from hosting to invoicing and reporting services. But I also pay for web <em>content</em> when it&#8217;s compelling enough. Here are some web sites with writing and art that I think are worth supporting directly:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"><strong>New York Times.</strong></a> Still the best reporting on the 2016 presidential campaign. While I usually use RSS for news and blogs, I check the New York Times manually each morning to see what is happening in the world. <em>$10/month.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://insider.espn.com/"><strong>ESPN Insider.</strong></a> Extra articles to supplement what I read during NBA season. Seemed easy to justify as an expense for my podcast <a href="http://technicalfoul.fm/">Technical Foul</a> with Ben Thompson. Also comes with the ESPN print magazine. <em>$39/year.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://club.macstories.net/"><strong>Club MacStories.</strong></a> I&#8217;ve enjoyed reading MacStories for years, and the club subscription adds a bunch of great content in a weekly newsletter. You also get occasional book downloads such as for Federico Viticci&#8217;s new <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-10-the-macstories-review/">epic iOS 10 review</a>. <em>$5/month.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://sixcolors.com/subscribe/"><strong>Six Colors.</strong></a> Jason Snell wasted no time after leaving Macworld. Seemingly overnight, Six Colors has become an important site for Apple fans. Jason and Dan Moren talk informally about current work, travel, writing, and tools on their secret podcast for subscribers. There&#8217;s also a monthly email magazine. <em>$6/month.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://stratechery.com/membership/"><strong>Stratechery.</strong></a> Thoughtful analysis of current news and trends from Ben Thompson, delivered Monday through Thursday via email or RSS for subscribers. Great depth to stories about tech company business models and where the industry is going. Helps pay for his NBA League Pass subscription. <em>$10/month.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://itsoncraft.com/"><strong>Craft.</strong></a> An archive of sketches, rough animation, and preproduction artwork from animated films. It&#8217;s like an expanded version of behind-the-scenes DVD extras and art books. Initially subscribed for the rough animation for the beautiful film Song of the Sea. <em>$6/month.</em></p>
<p>Before the web dominated all publishing, it was normal to pay for the newspaper and maybe a few print magazines. Then we entered a period where everything had to be free. Now, paying for content is useful again. The sites above have figured something out about building an audience and creating good content.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.archive.org/2016/04/05/getting-back-to-view-source-on-the-web-the-movable-web-decentralized-web/">Brewster Kahle has a post at the Internet Archive</a> about getting back to the &#8220;view source&#8221; feature that made early web development so much more accessible than it is today. He thinks it can be achieved on top of a distributed web where all the HTML and JavaScript files are delivered to the browser:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The decentralized web works by having a p2p distribution of the files that make up the website, and then the website runs in your browser. By being completely portable, the website has all the pieces it needs: text, programs, and data. It can all be versioned, archived, and examined.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He mentions IPFS in particular, which <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">I&#8217;ve written about before</a>. The bottom line is that static HTML sites are more portable. They more naturally evolve not just from host to host as necessary, but also to a possible distributed future web. That&#8217;s why that — even though I still use and recommend WordPress — I have a <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/complete-mirror-of-this-blog.html">static mirror of my site too</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Facebook continues to roll out their Instant Articles format to more publishers. It’s now available to anyone, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/publishing">with this catch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “You won&#8217;t be able to publish Instant Articles until your RSS feed has been approved.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s just what we need: the worst part of the App Store approval process applied to the web. No thanks.</p>
<p>Google’s competing Accelerated Mobile Pages has problems too, as I mentioned in the last half of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/twitter-and-the-cost-of-links.html">this post about the cost of links</a>. Although unlike Facebook, which wants to trap content behind their own platform, AMP is at least more open and useful to the larger web.</p>
<p>I hate to say it but neither Instant Articles nor AMP are really good enough. I think we need a third standard for super-fast web pages. (Or do we? Maybe the web is okay as-is if we <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">fight page bloat</a>.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speaking of <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/01/hyperlinks-and-saving-the-web">the health of the open web</a>, Maciej Cegłowski gave a talk on web page bloat at the Web Directions conference, and he put <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">the slides and notes online</a> (via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/01/02/website-obesity-crisis">Daring Fireball</a>). It&#8217;s fun to read and there are many great points, but I want to focus on Accelerated Mobile Pages:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “The AMP project is ostentatiously open source, and all kinds of publishers have signed on. Out of an abundance of love for the mobile web, Google has volunteered to run the infrastructure, especially the user tracking parts of it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sarcasm aside, I think Google&#8217;s involvement is mostly transparent, and I was hopeful about it when <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/11/accelerated-mobile-pages-from-google.html">I wrote about this in November</a>. Google wants the web to be fast. A faster web includes more ad impressions and is more competitive with native mobile apps. I don&#8217;t think this disqualifies Google from proposing this project.</p>
<p><a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/12/14/does-amp-counter-an-existential-threat-to-google.html">High Scalability has a long article</a> exploring AMP:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Google needs an open and rich ecosystem of knowledge. If that’s not there then Google search won’t be relevant. Which is Google’s direct self-interest, which is also the same objective of the publisher. Publishers need access to an open ecosystem of distribution. Otherwise they’ll have a harder time building audiences if they have to appeal to closed platforms. Yes, Google is a private company that has business interests, but that philosophy and that core similar objective is something very important when considering Google’s role in AMP.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to give Google the benefit of the doubt on AMP. The alternatives are too focused on specific platforms and so even less available to the rest of the web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://scripting.com/2015/09/11/aGoodDayToThinkAboutWebHistory.html">Dave Winer</a> on the continued disappearance of old web sites:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to sound the alarms. Every day we lose more of the history of the web. Every day is an opportunity to act to make sure we don&#8217;t lose more of it. And we should be putting systems into place to be more sure we don&#8217;t lose future history.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://stevenf.com/2015/09/09/http-is-obsolete-its-time-for-the-distributed-permanent-web/">Steven Frank pointed to</a> a new format and protocol called IPFS, which <a href="https://blog.neocities.org/its-time-for-the-permanent-web.html">Neocities is embracing</a>. Copies of your content would live in multiple nodes across the web instead of in a single, centralized location. From their blog post:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Distributing the web would make it less malleable by a small handful of powerful organizations, and that improves both our freedom and our independence. It also reduces the risk of the &#8216;one giant shutdown&#8217; that takes a massive amount of data with it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I took some time to read through what it can do, and I&#8217;d like to support it for the publishing platform that&#8217;s in my new microblogging project. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s technically feasible yet, but I love that someone is trying to solve this. We just have to start somewhere.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;The old web where I feel like more people saw the web as what I was talking about: as a unique and amazing invention in human history, a thing that can bring the 6 billion voices out into the open, to tell their stories and say what they&#8217;re going to say. That this thing is really something special, and it shouldn&#8217;t just be treated as a way for monetizing eyeballs and figuring out great new advances in interstitial ads. [&#8230;] We can&#8217;t lose sight of the opportunity this is. And if the story really is that the web exploded in the mid 90s and became a wonderful thing, and then stopped being that wonderful thing a little more than 20 years later&#8230; Then I couldn&#8217;t even bear that heartbreak.&#8221;

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://therealadam.com/2013/04/08/web-design-for-busy-programmers/">Adam Keys has several tips for programmers</a>, to make our web sites look better by keeping things simple. I often just use grayscale, too:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Most important: design in greyscale. Color is hard and can lead to tinkering. My goal is to get in and out of the front-end bits quickly, so tinkering is the enemy. Greyscale is one dimensional, greatly simplifying matters. Give important information higher contrast and less important information or ‘chrome’ less contrast. Now you’re done thinking about color.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>These days I also start everything with <a href="http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, which adds great defaults for layout, buttons, and text. It makes everything looks better, right away. It’s not a replacement for a designer, but it does save hours (or days) of getting the basics up and running.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I launched Tweet Marker Plus, I documented that it would store &#8220;about a month&#8221; of tweets. I didn&#8217;t want to promise too much before I fully understood the storage requirements. After a few weeks, I officially bumped it up to &#8220;at least 2 months&#8221;. I also added a full archive of your own tweets, which are never deleted.</p>
<p>The truth is I&#8217;ve yet to write the code that actually deletes any tweets from the database and search index. Eventually I&#8217;ll have to, but not yet. So I&#8217;ll continue to evolve the service in a way that makes it more useful and sustainable.</p>
<p>Recently I increased the $2/month price to $5/month, with the search index expanded to 3 months of tweets. Today I&#8217;m officially bumping the storage again, to 6 months of tweets. I&#8217;ve also changed to monthly billing instead of once every 3 months. Everyone who already has the $2/month plan will get to keep it. No price increase for you, and you still get the new 6-month storage and new features, as a thank-you for being an early subscriber.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ve added a major new feature. You can now create custom collections of tweets and publish them to share with others. This is a feature from my iOS app Tweet Library, and in fact any published collection from Tweet Library will also show up in Tweet Marker Plus. New in Tweet Marker, you have the option of keeping a collection private or making it linkable, without it showing up when someone browses the list of collections.</p>
<p><a href="http://tweetmarker.net/plus/account">The screenshots linked on the account page</a> include an example of how collections work.</p>
<p>As a bonus for Mac users, there&#8217;s also a new menubar search app. This little Mac app hides in the menubar and gives quick access to searching your Tweet Marker Plus timeline and archive. <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/software/tweetmarker/screenshots/menu_search.png">Here&#8217;s a screenshot</a> of what version 1.0 looks like.</p>
