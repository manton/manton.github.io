<blockquote><p>&#8220;Maybe we should just give up on the term REST, since it&#8217;s become so diluted as to mean nothing more than &#8216;HTTP API that&#8217;s not as hard to use as SOAP&#8217;?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds right. &#8220;Pure REST&#8221;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer was never strictly followed, and the advantage to consistent HTTP methods &mdash; being able to abstract parts of the client details away, as with &#8220;ActiveResource&#8221;:http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveResource/Base.html &mdash; don&#8217;t seem like significant savings to me. Now that XML-RPC and SOAP are mostly dead, we assume that new APIs are going to be usable from any language without much effort. I won&#8217;t object to having one less acronym in the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Dave Winer proposes&#8221;:http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/01/05/rethinkingAuthentication.html a simple solution to revoking authentication in web services:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now imagine that Twitter had a page that showed all the IP addresses that have used your login in the last 30 days, with a start date for each and a count of calls made. I bet you could figure out which one was The Greasy Spoon Group, pronto. Further suppose there was a checkbox next to each IP address. You could uncheck that one, click Submit, and voila, no more spam from your account.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>There are important things missing here, such as not sharing your credentials, but I have to admit I do like the simplicity. If the hostnames were grouped by user agent, the UI wouldn&#8217;t even be half bad. If nothing else, maybe this will light a fire under OAuth implementors to get moving. (And I count myself in that group too, since I&#8217;m involved with some services that need OAuth pretty badly.)</p>
<p>If you &#8220;string together tweets from Alex Payne&#8221;:http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&amp;ands=oauth&amp;phrase=&amp;ors=&amp;nots=&amp;tag=&amp;lang=all&amp;from=al3x&amp;to=&amp;ref=&amp;near=&amp;within=15&amp;units=mi&amp;since=&amp;until=&amp;rpp=50, it makes for an interesting narrative about OAuth too.</p>
