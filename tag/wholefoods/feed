				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/08/starting-over.html">One year ago</a>, I celebrated my first day without a boss. I had just written <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/2weeks">2 weeks of daily blog posts</a> about wrapping up work after 14 years at the same company. Today, I&#8217;m wearing the same Mac t-shirt and working from Whole Foods again to mark the anniversary.</p>
<p>So how has it gone, a full year as an independent developer? It depends who you ask. While I was leaving the best day job I&#8217;ll ever have, there&#8217;s still no substitute for the flexibility and freedom to work on my own projects. From that perspective, the last year has been amazing, with some great success on new revenue from <a href="http://www.coreint.org/">Core Intuition</a> and contracting too.</p>
<p>And I made a few decisions early on with how to manage the business that have proven useful to smooth over the bumps. For example, I pay myself a fixed salary on the 1st day of each month, and for 12 months straight I&#8217;ve always met that goal. This month, I gave myself a small raise.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#8217;m still bringing in less money than when I had a real job, and my wife might say that there&#8217;s a fine line between being self-employed and unemployed. We&#8217;ve let our credit card debt go unchecked. There&#8217;s been no slack in the high monthly expenses of the house, car payments, business costs like hosting, and everything else. My income from <a href="http://www.riverfold.com/">Riverfold</a> has grown significantly, but not significantly enough.</p>
<p>Yet, I&#8217;m upbeat. I&#8217;m upbeat because of the potential for what I set out to do a year ago: ship <a href="http://snippets.today/">Snippets.today</a> and help revolutionize independent microblogging. That&#8217;s still the plan. That&#8217;s still why this experiment of working for myself is in its very early stages, even a year later.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Am I always starting over<br />
In a brand new story?<br />
Am I always back at one<br />
After all I&#8217;ve done?&#8221;<br />
— <a href="https://itun.es/us/5MKtZ?i=860769901">Always Starting Over</a>, from the broadway show If/Then</em></p>
<p>Daniel said on the <a href="http://coreint.org/192">latest Core Intuition</a> that it’s important to celebrate major work milestones, like shipping a new app or quitting a job. I didn’t think I’d be celebrating right away, but as it turned out, my wife met me for lunch on Friday and we had a beer to mark the occasion. She snapped this photo:</p>

<p>Some things just work out. I couldn’t have picked a better t-shirt to wear if I had planned it.</p>
<p>When 5pm came around I made a final comment on Confluence, replied to a couple emails, and then signed out of HipChat. But I didn&#8217;t have time for much reflection. My son and I were busy packing up to head to a campout with Boy Scouts. Then as soon as we arrived back the next day, I turned around again to take my daughter to see <a href="http://idinamenzel.com/">Idina Menzel</a>.</p>
<p>The concert was incredible, somehow including both Wicked&#8217;s &#8220;Defying Gratify&#8221; and Radiohead&#8217;s &#8220;Creep&#8221; — and yes, of course Frozen — to make a show with both the occasional explicit lyric <em>and</em>  little kids pulled up from the audience to sing. It was only while driving home from the concert that I had a moment to think what I need to do next. Idina&#8217;s lines from If/Then at the beginning of this post kept coming back to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve worked a long time on a few things, and they were pretty good, but now it&#8217;s time to start over. I turn 40 in a few months. It&#8217;s time to figure out what the next 10 years of my life should be about.</p>
