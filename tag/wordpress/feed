				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2015/12/episode-210-they-pushed-it-to-github/">latest Core Intuition</a>, we talk about open source Swift, it&#8217;s potential for web server frameworks, and more about blogging tools. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Daniel and Manton react to Swift’s open-sourcing, and the extent to which it adds momentum to the language and increases its appeal. They also discuss the open-sourcing of Microsoft’s MarsEdit-esque blog editor, Windows Live Writer.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>There were also a few new jobs posted to <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">jobs.coreint.org</a> yesterday. Check them out if you&#8217;re considering a change for 2016, or just curious what is out there for Objective-C and Swift jobs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve become quite the fan of WordPress and Automattic over the last year, since <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/thank-you-movable-type.html">finally switching</a>. WordPress still has some problems — mostly in self-hosted web admin performance, and the clunkiness of editing themes — but Automattic is a good company. Around web publishing and hosting, I think 2 platforms are going to last for decades: GitHub and WordPress.</p>
<p><a href="https://poststatus.com/interviews-matt-mullenweg/">There&#8217;s a great interview</a> with Automattic founder Matt Mullenweg on the Post Status podcast:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I had the opportunity to interview Matt Mullenweg about an ambitious project that included more than a year and a half of development to create an all new WordPress.com interface, both for the web and a desktop app. The project was codenamed Calypso, and we talked about many aspects of Calypso, as well as a variety of subjects that relate to it.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>After listening to this episode, I&#8217;ve subscribed to the podcast. Looking forward to being a little more aware of what is going on in the WordPress community.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/how-it-works/">The project technical overview for AMP</a> has the goals and basic info. In a nutshell, the new format encourages a return to more bare-bones HTML, with some added functionality for common web patterns. On the balance between bloated ad platforms and user experience:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Embedding an ad or analytics often implies giving up control of what eventually happens to a site because they can typically inject any JavaScript they want into pages. AMP HTML does not allow this. We realize that both ads and analytics are an important element of monetization on the web, and so we need to support them: our goal is to realign monetization with great user experience.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, &#8220;tracking pixels&#8221; are used for analytics. These should be easily skipped by ad blockers, but apps that support AMP will need to use a custom web view anyway, where ad blockers on iOS aren&#8217;t allowed. This may continue to limit the appeal of Safari View Controller.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/googles-got-plan-make-mobile-web-less-slow/">Wired covers the announcement</a> and describes how AMP might be integrated into Twitter and other native apps:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;One surprise beneficiary of AMP may be Twitter. While it’s not a publisher per se, it’s becoming an increasingly important player in news, most recently with the launch of <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/meet-moments-twitters-new-feature/">its Moments feature</a>, which makes news easier to follow on Twitter by organizing Tweets in a chronological, coherent timeline. Now, Twitter will automatically load any articles that are compatible with AMP as AMP files, meaning they will benefit from the same speed inside the Twitter app.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml">more on GitHub</a>. On the surface this seems like a more open approach than Facebook Instant Articles or maybe even Apple News Format (which is <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/Apple_News_Format_Ref/index.html">finally public</a>). That <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com/2015/10/07/mobile-web/">WordPress is supporting AMP</a> is a good sign.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been blogging here for 13 years. If you take any random post from that first year, the majority of the links to other web sites are broken. The default outcome for any site that isn&#8217;t maintained — including the one you&#8217;re reading right now — is for it to vanish. <a href="http://www.manton.org/2012/07/permanence.html">Permanence</a> doesn&#8217;t exist on the web.</p>
<p>We can <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/09/web-history-and-ipfs.html">solve this</a>, but it will take time. For now I think mirroring our writing is a great solution, to guard against domain names expiring and other inevitable failures. But where to mirror to?</p>
<p>Only 2 companies keep coming to mind: WordPress.com and GitHub. I believe both will last for decades, maybe even 100 years, and both embrace the open web in a way that most other centralized web sites do not.</p>
<p>Even though I self-host this weblog on WordPress, I&#8217;ve chosen to mirror to GitHub because of their focus on simple, static publishing via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. It has the best chance of running for a long time without intervention.</p>
<p>I exported all of manton.org with the <a href="http://www.httrack.com/">httrack</a> command-line tool and checked it into GitHub, with a CNAME for <a href="http://mirror.manton.org/">mirror.manton.org</a>. It works perfectly. I still need to automate this process so that it updates regularly, but I&#8217;m very happy to finally have a complete mirror for the first time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress.html">writing about my WordPress-based microblog</a> and linking to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/more-quick-blogging-workflows.html">similar solutions from Seth Clifford and Ben Brooks</a>, I’ve been hearing from more bloggers about their interesting microblog workflows. Everyone has a slightly different spin on the basic idea, but all of them achieve some independence from Twitter by having the primary copy of each post live on their own site.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://alpha.app.net/chasemccoy/post/61446625">Chase McCoy mentions on App.net</a> that he uses Launch Center Pro for quick microblogging of links:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “To make a post all I have to do is copy a link, and then run a Launch Center Pro action that prompts me for the text of the post. One click and it&#8217;s done!”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, <a href="http://vandragt.com/2015/06/microblogging-with-wordpress-and-twitter">Sander van Dragt describes</a> his WordPress setup. It’s similar to mine, but his post includes more detail. He also links to a comment on <a href="https://gist.github.com/manton/f8b6f8b391a2f3d9b419#comment-1480486">my .htaccess gist</a> with a better explanation and rewrite rules.</p>
<p>Next up, <a href="http://adamsimpson.net/writing/microblogging">Adam Simpson shares</a> how he posts to his own microblog directly from an SMS. He even goes one step further, integrating tweet features directly back into WordPress:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I save the tweet ID of every post that gets posted to Twitter. I use that ID to pull in the favorite and retweet counts and display them next to each ‘note’ in the WordPress dashboard.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally, here’s <a href="https://alpha.app.net/mrhenko/post/61441031#61435778">an AppleScript solution on App.net from Henrik Carlsson</a> that allows him to take any text on his Mac and quickly post it to his microblog via an Automator workflow. Pretty great. I had forgotten that AppleScript has native XML-RPC support, which most blogging systems support.</p>
<p>I’m inspired by all the cool work people are doing around blogs. It’s a good time to write on the web.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a great conversion with Seth Clifford one night at WWDC, about writing and blogging. We all want to get better at writing and posting more frequently. As I mentioned <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/we-need-more-bad-ideas.html">in yesterday’s post</a>, the best way to improve anything is to do more of it, more often.</p>
<p>I believe there are two important facets to microblogging. The first is the timeline experience: a reverse-chronological list of posts from your friends, like you see on Twitter. The second is that posting should be effortless: if there’s less friction between your idea and publishing it, you’ll write more often. So a big part of posting regularly is just having a system that makes it easy.</p>
<p><a href="http://sethclifford.me/2015/06/auto-posting-to-wordpress-and-archiving-in-dropbox-with-drafts/">Seth updated his iOS blogging workflow</a> by using Drafts and WordPress’s email-to-blog feature. As a nice bonus, he gets Markdown files of each post saved to Dropbox:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Drafts allows you to send email as an action. WordPress allows you to post into the system via email. Using a combination of the action and the <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/post-by-email/">Jetpack plugin’s email functionality</a>, I can go from idea to published in seconds, without touching the WP iOS app (which continues to get better, but still isn’t <em>fast</em>) and get my local copy stored away.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Also this week, Ben Brooks has switched his core Twitter posting to go through WordPress. He has a <a href="http://benb.me/">standalone microblog at benb.me</a> where the posts live. They go out to Twitter automatically via IFTTT. Posting to a blog first and then Twitter second seems like a simple idea, but it is extremely powerful. Years from now you end up with an archive of all your short-form writing at your own domain. Not as an afterthought, but as the <em>default</em>.</p>
<p>The great thing about blogging is there’s no one correct way to do this stuff. I’m really happy to see these solutions from Seth and Ben, and I know other folks are working on similar workflows.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/wordpress-microblog-posting-from-do-note.html">I wrote at a high level</a> how I improved my microblogging workflow before WWDC, but I’d like to use this post to show the surrounding details. I hope it’s useful to other folks who want to control their own content.</p>
<p><strong>Post formats</strong>. Newer versions of WordPress have the concept of post formats. Normal blog posts have a “standard” format, but there are also these types: aside, image, link, quote, and status. For microblogs, I recommend “status”.</p>
<p><strong>No titles</strong>. As I proposed <a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/09/defining-a-microblog-post.html">in a previous blog post</a>, for small posts we should revisit an original feature of RSS: the title of a post is optional. In fact, early blogging systems like Radio Userland didn’t even have a title field. When you’re writing a microblog post in WordPress, just leave the title blank, and if necessary update the post template to not include the title in HTML or the RSS feed.</p>
<p><strong>RSS feeds</strong>. If you create a brand new WordPress blog for microblog posts, you won’t need to do anything special about RSS feeds. But if you share a single blog for both standard and status formats, you may want to have 2 feeds: one that excludes microblog posts and one that contains <em>only</em> microblog posts. Just use a special category for microblog posts in addition to the post format. <a href="https://gist.github.com/manton/f8b6f8b391a2f3d9b419">Here’s a section of my .htaccess file</a> where I use the “cat” parameter to include or exclude this category for my blog’s feeds.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone posting</strong>. One of the lessons from Twitter is that posting should be effortless. Using WordPress on iOS is fine, but I’ve found that wiring up a simple posting recipe in IFTTT’s <a href="https://ifttt.com/products/do/note">Do Note app</a> makes it trivial to post from your phone. Use the WordPress action in IFTTT but also get <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ifttt-post-formats/">this WordPress plug-in</a>. Since the WordPress action can’t yet specify a post format, the plug-in can simulate it by using a special ifttt-status category. <a href="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/microblog_screenshot_status.png">Here’s a screenshot</a> of what my IFTTT recipe looks like.</p>
<p><strong>Tweeting</strong>. Now that you have a blog that contains all your microblog posts, you can wire it up to Twitter to automatically cross-post them as tweets. You’re writing <em>on your own site first</em>, but the posts still go out to your Twitter followers. Again, use an IFTTT recipe that pulls from your microblog RSS feed and sends the post content to Twitter. Since I don’t post to Twitter, <a href="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/microblog_screenshot_rss.png">I’ve set mine to post to App.net</a> instead. You can continue to reply and favorite directly on Twitter.</p>
<p>I’m very excited about the potential for microblogging. For the last year I’ve been working on a new platform around this stuff. By adopting some of these tips for WordPress, your microblog will be ready for my platform, but more importantly your blog will be open and extensible. Let’s get back to our roots with RSS and see what tools and web sites we can build.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally have a great use for IFTTT’s <a href="https://ifttt.com/products/do/note">Do Note</a> app. I’ve wired it up to my WordPress blog so that I can quickly publish microblog posts there. Previously, if I was on the go I could use the official WordPress iOS app, but that requires a bunch of extra taps: setting the post format to “status”, setting the category to “Snippets”, and going back and forth between screens. Now all of those defaults are baked into the IFTTT recipe. (Grab <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ifttt-post-formats/">this WordPress plug-in</a> to set the custom post formats automatically.)</p>
<p>I also wanted to streamline my cross-posting to App.net, which before now had been a manual copy and paste. I use a pair of RSS triggers in IFTTT for this as well, to go from my main RSS feed and my microblog RSS feed. And at the same time, I’ve updated the CSS for <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">my microblog posts</a> so they look a little better over the web.</p>
<p>Effortless tweeting is a big part of what Twitter got right on user experience. With WWDC around the corner, I should be posting to my own microblog more frequently now that I have a good workflow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I fixed some URL-related issues with this blog since moving to WordPress. Clicking through multiple pages of posts in a category now works again. I tweaked the category links slightly, dropping the .html extension, but all the old URLs are preserved through redirects.</p>
<p>Also a reminder if you&#8217;re subscribed to the RSS feed: my shorter, microblog-style posts go into the <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro/">Snippets category</a>, which  is not included in the main feed. If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to those as well, just add the <a href="http://www.manton.org/snippets.xml">Snippets RSS feed</a> to your news reader. I also still cross-post them to App.net.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.manton.org/2014/05/snippets.html">I mentioned earlier this year</a> that I really liked how <a href="http://noahread.net/snippets">Noah Read</a> posted tweets and photos to his own site, calling them snippets. I&#8217;m borrowing that name and implementing something similar here. If you visit <a href="http://www.manton.org/">my home page</a>, you&#8217;ll see these short posts already interspersed alongside regular, longer posts.</p>
<p>These new snippets don&#8217;t show up in the normal RSS feed. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.manton.org/snippets.xml">separate feed at /snippets.xml</a> for them, and they get their own category for browsing on the web. I&#8217;ll also be cross-posting them to App.net.</p>
<p>Like the posts in Dave Winer&#8217;s new <a href="http://radio3.io/">Radio3</a>, these RSS items don&#8217;t have titles. They&#8217;ll be short like a tweet or App.net post: usually 100-200 characters.</p>
<p>This is the first step in a larger project that I&#8217;m working on — something fun that reminds me of the early days of blogging. But if nothing else, it&#8217;s nice to control my own content again. I should have kept all these microblog posts on my own domain years ago.</p>
