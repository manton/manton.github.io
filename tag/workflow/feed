				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/blogging-your-photos.html">written about already</a>, I now post photos to my own site in addition to Instagram. I use the <a href="https://workflow.is/">Workflow app</a> to make this easier, automatically uploading a photo and making a new blog post for it from iOS.</p>
<p>Ryan Toohil has taken my rough workflow <a href="https://blog.ryantoohil.com/2016/03/owning-your-own-social-media-content.php">and improved it</a>, adding support for prompting for the photo title, fixing the photo’s orientation, and a better dynamic folder name based on the date. You can <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/c485d9227ed347c4b3aab2a94fb822d6">see his updated workflow here</a>.</p>
<p>I still have a lot to learn about using Workflow. It’s the kind of app that you can only really understand the potential for after diving in with a real problem. Now I find myself looking for more ways I can use the app.</p>
<p>I’ve also finally read Federico Viticci’s excellent <a href="http://www.imore.com/how-use-workflow-ios-when-you-dont-know-where-start">intro to Workflow over at iMore</a>, which includes this advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “When I was new to Workflow, visualizing the vertical flow of actions before building the stack was my biggest hurdle in getting started. I&#8217;ve since developed a habit that comes in handy every day: if I already know what a workflow should do at the beginning and at the end, I place the first action and the last one immediately on the canvas. Then, I only have to figure out how to go from Point A to Point B, dropping actions between those two as I play around with different ideas.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Federico has written many times about Workflow. He has an article about <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/publishing-articles-to-wordpress-with-workflow-on-ios/">using Workflow to post to WordPress</a>, and tips and example workflows in the MacStories Club email. His podcast <a href="https://www.relay.fm/canvas">Canvas</a> with Fraser Speirs also routinely discusses workflows.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cdevroe.com/15094/fits-and-starts-and-homesteading">Colin Devroe started microblogging</a> on his own site, with separate sections for statuses and photos:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “I want to post content to my own personal site and not through closed social networks — because I want to keep control of everything I create forever. [&#8230;] This doesn’t mean that I won’t be posting to Twitter or Facebook or Instagram, but that everything that I post there will originate here on my site.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s the photos and their RSS feed that caught my attention. Others have done this too, but for some reason I rarely post photos here on my own site. I’ve stuck with using Instagram instead.</p>
<p>I need to change that. I do like the Instagram app, though, so I’m going to keep using it. I’ll just copy the photos over to my site as well, and I’ll use <a href="https://workflow.is/">Workflow on iOS</a> to help automate it. The basic steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>After posting the photo on Instagram, copy the caption to the iOS clipboard. This will be the title of the blog post.</li>
<li>Select the Instagram-edited image in the Photos app and run the workflow.</li>
<li>Workflow makes a filename based on the title, with some simple substitutions. Lowercase, spaces become underscores, and drop some characters.</li>
<li>Transmit gets launched and I confirm the upload to my own server.</li>
<li>Workflow creates a WordPress blog post with an img tag and the relevant metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not bad. You can <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/75265d33bcd64c4d8485b2644de7df17">see the workflow here</a>. I’ve uploaded a bunch of my most recent Instagram photos this way. I’m not sure whether I’ll go back and mirror all the old ones.</p>
<p>These photos live under a new <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/photos">Photos category</a>. I’ve excluded this category from the main RSS feed that I use for cross-posting, so they won’t automatically go to Twitter. You can continue to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/manton/">follow me on Instagram</a> if you prefer that.</p>
