				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.natashathenomad.com/blog/digital-nomad-productivity-trick-one-thing">Natasha the Nomad has a post</a> about prioritizing the “one thing” that has to be finished today, even if everything else slips:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When I wake up (or the night before), I think &#8220;What is the one thing that I can do today to feel like I had a successful day, even If I nothing else gets done today&#8221;. No matter what, I end up getting that one thing done.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I find this kind of approach really useful. Saying you&#8217;re only going to finish one thing is admitting the reality that for many days, if you&#8217;re unfocused or juggling too many tasks, there&#8217;s a lot of &#8220;work&#8221; but nothing gets <em>done</em>. When I work out of the house in the morning with my iPad Pro, my goal is equally simple: publish a single blog post. If I can take care of email, edit other draft posts, work on planning notes for a project, etc. — that’s great too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I went to <a href="http://opencoffeeaustin.org/">Open Coffee Club</a> during SXSW week, I met several company founders and investors in Austin, and one was also an iOS developer. I usually do a poor job of promoting my own work in person, but I somehow managed to plug my <a href="http://coreint.org/">Core Intuition podcast</a>.</p>
<p>He hadn’t heard of the show before, and when he pulled it up to subscribe his comment was something like: “wow, you’ve been doing this for a long time”. It’s true. Daniel and I started the podcast in 2008. We only have 225 episodes, because we published episodes less frequently back in the old days, but I’ve always been proud of our consistency with the show format going back to the very beginning.</p>
<p>And it made me wonder: is there another Mac or iOS developer-focused tech podcast that has such a long history? Or really, many tech podcasts at all? The ones that come to mind are <a href="https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a>, which started in 2007, and <a href="https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech">This Week in Tech</a>, which started in 2005.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s another reminder to me that a big part of success is consistently showing up to work. If you&#8217;re always starting over, you can&#8217;t build on anything and take it further. The secret with the &#8220;version 2.0&#8221; of most apps isn&#8217;t that it has new features; it&#8217;s just that it exists at all.</p>
<p>In a couple months, just as WWDC is about to roll around, we’ll celebrate our 8th anniversary of recording Core Intuition. Our audience keeps growing, which is amazing, but there are still a lot of people who have never heard of the show. If you like what we&#8217;ve been doing, consider telling a friend, or posting a tweet or blog post about the show.</p>
<p>We expanded to 2 sponsors per episode this year because we wanted to grow the podcast — to commit more time and resources to both recording and to companion web sites like <a href="http://jobs.coreint.org/">the jobs site</a>. I think 2016 will be a great year and I&#8217;m happy that Core Intuition is a key part of helping me stay independent. Thanks for your support!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After wrapping up <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">30 days of new coffee shops</a>, last week <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/whats-next-after-30-days-of-coffee.html">I started visiting a library every day</a> to work. Libraries and coffee shops don&#8217;t have that much in common, but they do share a couple basic traits that are necessary for working on a laptop or iPad: wi-fi and tables. In fact, I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s even easier to find an open table or couch in a library than in a busy coffee shop.</p>
<p>So far, so good. In the first week, I&#8217;ve visited <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/whats-next-after-30-days-of-coffee.html">Cedar Park Public Library</a>, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/3741.html">Wells Branch Community Library</a>, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/3744.html">Little Walnut Creek Branch</a>, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/3759.html">North Village Branch</a>, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/3765.html">Old Quarry Branch</a>, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/3768.html">Howson Branch</a>, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/3776.html">Westbank Community Library</a>, and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/3783.html">Yarborough Branch</a>.</p>
<p>I also heard from readers who wanted to see more than the text microblog posts I did for coffee shops, so I&#8217;ve been trying to take more photos. These photos are tagged with <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/newlibraries">#newlibraries</a> too, so they&#8217;ll show up together with the library text posts. (Photos can be browsed over the web, but they don&#8217;t show up in the default RSS feed. The microblog posts also have <a href="http://www.manton.org/snippets.xml">their own feed</a>.)</p>
<p>As I mention on <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/02/episode-15-leap-year/">episode 15 of Timetable</a>, working out of the house in the morning helped provide some structure to the work day. I&#8217;d use the morning for writing blog posts and catching up on email, and the afternoon to focus on code. For libraries, I&#8217;m going one step further and <em>only bringing the iPad Pro with me</em>. This means that I&#8217;m using a small range of apps — Editorial, Mail, Safari, Slack — and reinforces the idea that I&#8217;m supposed to be writing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I wrapped up my <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">endeavor to visit a new coffee shop every day for a month</a>, making sure it was a place that I had never been to before. Every day I published a short microblog post about my visit. As I was nearing the end of the 30 days, I felt a little bummed out that it would be coming to an end. It was a lot of fun and gave my day a good structure.</p>
<p>I knew right away that I wanted to fill the <em>next</em> 30 days with something else, but probably not with drink or food again. I had a few ideas, including one outside that will be be better when the weather gets warmer. For this next month, though, I&#8217;ve decided to work from libraries.</p>
<p>So that’s where I am right now. Day 1 of 30, sitting in a comfy chair typing on my iPad at the Cedar Park Public Library. It&#8217;s a nice space and they even have an &#8220;internet cafe&#8221; outside the main books section. I&#8217;ll be trying to follow the same routine as before: morning out of the house for writing, afternoon usually back at my desk for coding. And as before, I&#8217;ll blog each day and <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/newlibraries">tag all the blog posts</a>. Here we go!</p>
