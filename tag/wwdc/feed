				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t post as much as I hoped to during WWDC 2016 — just a couple full posts related to the conference, a half dozen microblog posts, and one photo. But nevertheless I wanted to collect them together since I didn&#8217;t have a full wrap-up post <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/wwdc-2015-basketball-and-cartoons.html">like last year</a>.</p>
<p>One of the advantages to hosting my own short posts — and only cross-posting to Twitter as an afterthought, not the primary location — is that I can easily tag all the posts in a series. This worked out really well while <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">visiting coffee shops</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>For WWDC, I&#8217;ve used the tag <a href="http://www.manton.org/tag/wwdc2016">#wwdc2016</a>. I probably won&#8217;t go back to tag previous conferences, but I&#8217;ll use this format going forward for attending events where I publish a series of microblog posts and photos.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m back from San Francisco, catching up on everything I missed while traveling. I recorded a few podcast episodes during WWDC week, both my own and an interview.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.coreint.org/2016/06/episode-237-wwdc-2016/">On Core Intuition</a>, Daniel and I talked right after the keynote about the morning&#8217;s announcements. From the show notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Manton and Daniel react to the 2016 WWDC keynote. [&#8230;] iMessage and Siri extensibility, Continuity improvements, Apple Pay for the web, Apple’s keynote diversity, and more.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In the middle of the week, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-907896436/motiv-manton-normalized">I talked with John Voorhees of MacStories</a> about WWDC news but also a lot about microblogging. It may be the most I&#8217;ve shared about my latest project, all in one place.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I recorded a <a href="http://timetable.manton.org/2016/06/episode-24-san-francisco-reset/">short episode of Timetable</a>. I wanted to capture what the trip to San Francisco each year means to me, outside of the conference itself. I find the week a good opportunity to reset and think about where my focus should be across my projects.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ll be in San Francisco for WWDC, although as usual in recent years I won&#8217;t be staying all week. While out there I&#8217;ll be attending AltConf and other events, recording a podcast or two, and catching up on some writing.</p>
<p>I probably <em>should</em> take my MacBook Pro to code on projects, but I never have time. And I&#8217;ve been working so much lately, I probably need a break from Xcode for a few days. So I&#8217;m going to travel light this time and only take my iPad Pro with me.</p>
<p>I used my iPad Pro often when working <a href="http://www.manton.org/coffee-shops-austin">from coffee shops</a> and <a href="http://www.manton.org/libraries-austin">libraries</a> earlier this year. I think I have a pretty good sense of what I&#8217;m productive with on it. iPhone and Mac app coding is out, but email, chat, writing blog posts, and even light web site maintenance are all fine, and those are the kind of things I do while traveling.</p>
<p>That leaves podcast recording as the only question mark, but actually I&#8217;ve recorded every episode of <a href="http://timetable.fm/">Timetable</a> using my iPhone specifically so that I could get used to recording away from my office. I wrote <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/02/microphone-and-microcast-details.html">a few months ago</a> about my microphone for Timetable. I&#8217;ll do the same thing when Daniel and I record our WWDC thoughts after the keynote, with editing on the iPad Pro.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited about the conference. I&#8217;m looking forward to catching up with folks, the news from Apple, and — because I won&#8217;t even have my laptop — a bit of a break from the stress of thinking I should be programming.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s 2 weeks before WWDC, which means it was also 8 years ago that we published the <a href="http://www.coreint.org/2008/05/episode-1-two-voices/">first episode</a> of Core Intuition. At WWDC that year, Apple showed off iPhone OS 2.0, MobileMe, and the iPhone 3G. The yearly cycle of improvements to the OS and hardware don’t look much different today, but <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1151235/macs/apple-rolls.html">Apple keeps rolling</a>, and so the total changes since 2008 are massive.</p>
<p>For as many years as I’ve been out to San Francisco for WWDC (and to San Jose before then), each year I have fewer expectations for the conference itself. Some years I don’t even bother guessing or dreaming about new features — I have no pressing needs, no critical missing APIs, no questions to ask Apple engineers in the labs — and I’m happily surprised by whatever Apple gives us.</p>
<p>This year is a little different. It’s the first year that I can remember since the Mac OS X 10.0 and 10.1 releases where an Apple platform needed significant performance improvements to be usable for anyone except early adopters. The first couple versions of Apple Watch were ambitious on features, but now it’s time to do the less glamorous work of making the platform fast. I hope watchOS 3.0 will be the same kind of milestone that Mac OS X 10.2 was in that regard. (And like Mac OS X, I hope it can be done <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/03/slow-transitions-in-watchos.html">mostly in new software</a>.)</p>
<p>Back to WWDC the conference. I’m still thinking about the interesting venue change for Monday to the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium.</p>
<p>In the discussion on <a href="http://coreint.org/229">Core Intuition 229</a> last month, I kept coming back to the idea that this change has to be about growing the conference to allow more developers. Since more people show up on Monday (press and business folks, for example, who have less interest in the technical sessions or labs), you could have a bigger space on Monday and then <em>oversell</em> the conference as a whole, knowing that some ticket holders wouldn’t be around later in the week back at Moscone West.</p>
<p>Maybe that creates more problems than it solves because of packed rooms and long lines to get into sessions, though. Now that I’ve had a while to think about it, it seems unlikely that Apple would risk making the conference worse just to squeeze in another 500 developers.</p>
<p>Could there be some creative layouts in Moscone West that Apple hasn’t tried yet? There are so many downsides to changing the venue that I want to believe it’s part of addressing the biggest issue with the conference: most people don’t win the ticket lottery.</p>
<p>There’s still the problem of hotels. Linking to my post about <a href="http://www.manton.org/2016/04/dont-give-up-on-wwdc.html">not giving up on WWDC</a>, John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/04/20/reece-wwdc">singled out Airbnb</a> as a bad solution, since there just aren’t that many rooms available. That’s true. And even worse, potential <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobgorban/status/722889126870065156">last-minute cancellations</a> make Airbnb less reliable. Where I said Airbnb, I should have just said “cheaper hotel”.</p>
<p>(Alex Cash also has <a href="http://alex.cash/saving-on-wwdc/">tips for saving money at WWDC</a>. Casey Liss has a <a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2016/4/20/much-ado-about-wwdc">good post about rising hotel prices</a>.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I know some developers are using Airbnb this year, and I’d like to try it next year for a change of pace and scenery away from the conference. With the convenience of Uber, the risk of settling for a place farther away seems low.</p>
<p>And finally, I’ve enjoyed many recent podcasts about WWDC. Two highlights: <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/24">Under the Radar episode 24</a>, where Marco Arment and David Smith share their thoughts on whether to attend the conference; and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/tc/12">Thoroughly Considered 12</a>, about not just WWDC but the value of attending or exhibiting at conferences as a company.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://medium.com/@iOSMacConfs/finding-san-francisco-too-expensive-you-aren-t-alone-a4ecc7871245">There’s a nice sale</a> going on across several smaller, regional developer conferences right now. I think any of these conferences would be a great experience, so if you’re considering one you could save $100 by acting now.</p>
<p>I wanted to comment on <a href="http://www.joecieplinski.com/blog/2016/04/19/conferences-get-together-for-a-special-offer/">something Joe Cieplinski said</a> about WWDC while linking to this promotion:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Folks say that WWDC is the one time where <em>everyone</em> in our community can get together, but frankly, the price of hotels in San Francisco has made that statement a bit disingenuous. Many—if not most—of us can’t afford to make it to this party, so maybe this is no longer the party for “everyone.”
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.curtisherbert.com/wwdc-the-san-francisco-problem/">Curtis Herbert</a> also echoed some of these themes in a post:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  While it&#8217;s a shame to end the WWDC tradition, it makes sense to follow all the other technical communities out there and rely on smaller, more accessible and distributed, community-run conferences throughout the year. It&#8217;s a sign that our community growing up and leaving the nest. One city can&#8217;t hold us all anymore.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think it’s possible to go out to WWDC without spending a fortune. You can attend AltConf, find an Airbnb room for $150/night, and stay a few days instead of all week. I downgraded my expectations for WWDC and booked a cheaper hotel room a couple of months ago. It’s about how much you want to be there.</p>
<p>In fact, I’d still argue that it’s less expensive to “attend” WWDC now because it has been <em>proven</em> how much you can get out of AltConf and other events without the $1600 conference ticket. When I went to my first WWDC back when it was held in San Jose (and the same could be said for the early years in San Francisco), hotels and flights were cheaper but it was pointless to attend without a ticket.</p>
<p>I can’t go to every conference. This year I’ve picked 2: WWDC (probably without a ticket) and Release Notes (in September). <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/10/release-notes-2015.html">I wrote about Release Notes last year</a> and highly recommend it again.</p>
<p>But I stand by the opinion that WWDC is worth preserving as the best place for everyone to go — with or without a ticket, with or without a fancy hotel room — because there’s room for thousands of more developers than at a small conference. I hope that Apple’s change of venue for the keynote and Monday sessions means they are trying to expand the conference to even more developers.</p>
<p>I’m so excited about Monday’s new venue that I’m actually thinking about trying to get a ticket in the lottery, to experience what it’s like and what it means for the conference going forward. The main thing holding me back is that it seems wasteful if I’m not staying through Friday, when another developer — maybe someone who hasn’t attended before — could get that ticket instead.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s March 2009, the height of SXSW in Austin before the conference gets too big for itself. I&#8217;m hanging out downtown with tech folks from a blogging startup, having dinner and beers before we head to the party they&#8217;re putting on. The CTO, one of the first employees at the company, is talking about Memcache servers and MySQL scaling, and I&#8217;m hanging on every word. I love this stuff.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Mac and iOS developer, but I often take a break from native app development to work on server software. So I&#8217;m asking him about MySQL replication and what it&#8217;s like to run a schema migration without the database falling over. The conversation sometimes shifts back to Apple platforms, and he says he&#8217;s been thinking about going to WWDC. I had been attending WWDC for a while, so I say sure, it&#8217;s expensive but you should consider it. If you&#8217;re doing more web stuff, though, maybe it&#8217;s not as important that you attend.</p>
<p>We walk over to the party venue. It&#8217;s bigger and more crowded than he thought it would be. Their company has really taken off, growing well beyond the early days when it was just him and the founder trying to build something new. And it&#8217;s at this point that he turns to me and asks a question that brings us back to iOS development:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;So what do you think of my app, Instapaper?&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>In answer to Marco Arment, at that time the CTO of Tumblr, I mutter something about liking it, but I haven&#8217;t really gotten it into my workflow yet. Hopefully whatever I said was encouraging. In subsequent years, of course, Instapaper would be one of my favorite apps.</p>
<p>Later, replaying these conversations, I realized that I asked the wrong questions and gave the wrong advice. About WWDC, I should have said &#8220;Yes, absolutely!&#8221; with an exclamation point. Buy a ticket. If you can&#8217;t afford it, go anyway because you need to be there.</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t say that because I wasn&#8217;t listening closely enough. I was so busy asking questions about Tumblr, that I wasn&#8217;t listening to the excitement in his voice about Instapaper. I was so busy thinking about server scaling and databases and all this other stuff that I could&#8217;ve learned from a book, that I didn&#8217;t hear what he was really saying.</p>
<p>I should have asked about iOS pricing, free versions, sales, UI design, who did the icon, what does the private API look like. But I didn&#8217;t ask those things because I missed the big picture, how dominant the App Store would become for distribution, and so I missed what mattered. I&#8217;d like to think that since then I&#8217;ve gotten better at listening.</p>
<p>Daniel Jalkut and I had Marco as a special guest on <a href="http://coreint.org/200">Core Intuition 200</a> not just because he&#8217;s a friend but also because he so well represents the goal that many of us have and our listeners have — to start our own company, to find success not just one time but again and again, and to have as thoughtful an approach as possible in the craft of software development.</p>
<p>This week I&#8217;m in Indianapolis for the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/">Release Notes conference</a>. While I will have <a href="https://twitter.com/riverfold/status/651509114284044288">some stickers</a> for anyone interested in my new microblogging platform, and I&#8217;ll probably ramble about it at some length if asked, I&#8217;ll also be listening. I&#8217;ll be listening because you never know which random developer you just met will end up doing their best work in the years ahead, and you want to be as encouraging as possible, offer the right kind of feedback, and also learn from their perspective.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a great line in the Pixar movie Ratatouille:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Not everyone can become a great artist. But a great artist can come from anywhere.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that&#8217;s equally true for developers. We often see someone go from nothing to a top app in the App Store. We often see someone start without an audience and then make friends on Twitter and blogs through the quality of their writing alone. And so we welcome new voices all the time if they&#8217;re respectful.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been some debate about <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/10/13/pragmatic-pricing">Overcast 2.0&#8217;s patronage model</a>. Some of the discussion is healthy — how does a successful business model for one developer apply to other apps? — and some of the discussion is divisive. Instead of asking the right questions, it&#8217;s easy to jump straight to a <em>conclusion</em> with the dismissive statement: &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Marco, but his approach would never work for other developers&#8221;.</p>
<p>The &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Marco&#8221; attitude is poison for our community because it takes the opposite approach as that Ratatouille quote above. It implies that some developers have such an advantage that the rest of us shouldn&#8217;t even bother, because it&#8217;s not a level playing field. It&#8217;s true that some developers today have an advantage, whether through good timing or just a long history of shipping apps, but the lesson isn&#8217;t to give up; it&#8217;s to instead learn from it, and look at our own strengths. What small head start do we have that could grow into a great success tomorrow, too?</p>
<p>Rewind a handful of years, back to that day at SXSW when I could name plenty of developers who had more attention and success in our community than Marco Arment. You can be damn sure that didn&#8217;t discourage him from taking Instapaper from an &#8220;in my spare time&#8221; niche app to the top of the News section on the App Store.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never accept the implied negativity in the &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Marco&#8221; argument. I&#8217;ll never accept that we should be <em>jealous</em> of another developer&#8217;s success instead of <em>inspired</em> by it to do our best work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disney Legend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Norman">Floyd Norman</a> has an excellent blog, usually recollecting on the early days of the Walt Disney studio, or more recent animation ventures. This week <a href="http://floydnormancom.squarespace.com/blog/2015/7/29/a-visit-from-steve-jobs">he wrote about Steve Jobs</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “An animated motion picture goes through many iterations while in production and screenings were held on a regular basis. I honestly doubt Steve was trying to curry favor with Disney. Being a shrewd negotiator Jobs didn&#8217;t need any extra help to get his way. I think he brought Apple gifts purely as a gesture of friendliness. After all, shouldn&#8217;t everybody have a Mac Laptop?”

<p>The post includes a fantastic sketch of Steve. My only regret from WWDC this year is that I didn’t have a ticket to see Floyd speak at the conference. Although Apple doesn’t usually release the video of lunchtime sessions, I very much hope it was filmed and will show up on YouTube or Vimeo one day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a great conversion with Seth Clifford one night at WWDC, about writing and blogging. We all want to get better at writing and posting more frequently. As I mentioned <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/we-need-more-bad-ideas.html">in yesterday’s post</a>, the best way to improve anything is to do more of it, more often.</p>
<p>I believe there are two important facets to microblogging. The first is the timeline experience: a reverse-chronological list of posts from your friends, like you see on Twitter. The second is that posting should be effortless: if there’s less friction between your idea and publishing it, you’ll write more often. So a big part of posting regularly is just having a system that makes it easy.</p>
<p><a href="http://sethclifford.me/2015/06/auto-posting-to-wordpress-and-archiving-in-dropbox-with-drafts/">Seth updated his iOS blogging workflow</a> by using Drafts and WordPress’s email-to-blog feature. As a nice bonus, he gets Markdown files of each post saved to Dropbox:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Drafts allows you to send email as an action. WordPress allows you to post into the system via email. Using a combination of the action and the <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/post-by-email/">Jetpack plugin’s email functionality</a>, I can go from idea to published in seconds, without touching the WP iOS app (which continues to get better, but still isn’t <em>fast</em>) and get my local copy stored away.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Also this week, Ben Brooks has switched his core Twitter posting to go through WordPress. He has a <a href="http://benb.me/">standalone microblog at benb.me</a> where the posts live. They go out to Twitter automatically via IFTTT. Posting to a blog first and then Twitter second seems like a simple idea, but it is extremely powerful. Years from now you end up with an archive of all your short-form writing at your own domain. Not as an afterthought, but as the <em>default</em>.</p>
<p>The great thing about blogging is there’s no one correct way to do this stuff. I’m really happy to see these solutions from Seth and Ben, and I know other folks are working on similar workflows.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/inside-ios-9-search-apples-plan-for-more-connected-apps/">Federico Viticci has a comprehensive write-up</a> about Apple’s approach to search in iOS 9, including comments from developers. On local app search:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With local app search, iOS 9 can build an index of content, app features, and activities that users may want to get back to with a search query. Built like a database and already in use by Apple apps such as Mail and Reminders, CoreSpotlight will provide low level access to the index of an iOS device, making it easy to organize and retrieve content users have previously seen, created, or curated.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been slowly going through WWDC session videos, but haven’t cracked open the documentation for search yet. Sounds like an important new API for any app that has user documents.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2015/06/15/apple-news-and-the-open-web/">Daniel Jalkut has an optimistic take</a> on Apple News. He doesn’t think it is comparable to centralized publishing systems like Twitter or Medium for one important reason:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Because <em>the content doesn’t live on Apple’s servers</em>. This is a key distinction in my mind. Apple’s News App serves primarily not as a <em>source</em> of information, but as an amplifier of it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Any technology that invokes “amplifier” in a review is something I want to pay attention to. I used the same word in the closing paragraph of <a href="http://manton.org/2013/08/waiting_for_appnets.html">my pitch for App.net</a>. That service is fading away now, of course, but it’s just another reminder that even the most well-intentioned platforms are dangerous if they distract us from controlling our own content and hosting it at a custom domain.</p>
