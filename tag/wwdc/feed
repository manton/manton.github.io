				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s March 2009, the height of SXSW in Austin before the conference gets too big for itself. I&#8217;m hanging out downtown with tech folks from a blogging startup, having dinner and beers before we head to the party they&#8217;re putting on. The CTO, one of the first employees at the company, is talking about Memcache servers and MySQL scaling, and I&#8217;m hanging on every word. I love this stuff.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Mac and iOS developer, but I often take a break from native app development to work on server software. So I&#8217;m asking him about MySQL replication and what it&#8217;s like to run a schema migration without the database falling over. The conversation sometimes shifts back to Apple platforms, and he says he&#8217;s been thinking about going to WWDC. I had been attending WWDC for a while, so I say sure, it&#8217;s expensive but you should consider it. If you&#8217;re doing more web stuff, though, maybe it&#8217;s not as important that you attend.</p>
<p>We walk over to the party venue. It&#8217;s bigger and more crowded than he thought it would be. Their company has really taken off, growing well beyond the early days when it was just him and the founder trying to build something new. And it&#8217;s at this point that he turns to me and asks a question that brings us back to iOS development:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;So what do you think of my app, Instapaper?&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>In answer to Marco Arment, at that time the CTO of Tumblr, I mutter something about liking it, but I haven&#8217;t really gotten it into my workflow yet. Hopefully whatever I said was encouraging. In subsequent years, of course, Instapaper would be one of my favorite apps.</p>
<p>Later, replaying these conversations, I realized that I asked the wrong questions and gave the wrong advice. About WWDC, I should have said &#8220;Yes, absolutely!&#8221; with an exclamation point. Buy a ticket. If you can&#8217;t afford it, go anyway because you need to be there.</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t say that because I wasn&#8217;t listening closely enough. I was so busy asking questions about Tumblr, that I wasn&#8217;t listening to the excitement in his voice about Instapaper. I was so busy thinking about server scaling and databases and all this other stuff that I could&#8217;ve learned from a book, that I didn&#8217;t hear what he was really saying.</p>
<p>I should have asked about iOS pricing, free versions, sales, UI design, who did the icon, what does the private API look like. But I didn&#8217;t ask those things because I missed the big picture, how dominant the App Store would become for distribution, and so I missed what mattered. I&#8217;d like to think that since then I&#8217;ve gotten better at listening.</p>
<p>Daniel Jalkut and I had Marco as a special guest on <a href="http://coreint.org/200">Core Intuition 200</a> not just because he&#8217;s a friend but also because he so well represents the goal that many of us have and our listeners have — to start our own company, to find success not just one time but again and again, and to have as thoughtful an approach as possible in the craft of software development.</p>
<p>This week I&#8217;m in Indianapolis for the <a href="http://releasenotes.tv/">Release Notes conference</a>. While I will have <a href="https://twitter.com/riverfold/status/651509114284044288">some stickers</a> for anyone interested in my new microblogging platform, and I&#8217;ll probably ramble about it at some length if asked, I&#8217;ll also be listening. I&#8217;ll be listening because you never know which random developer you just met will end up doing their best work in the years ahead, and you want to be as encouraging as possible, offer the right kind of feedback, and also learn from their perspective.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a great line in the Pixar movie Ratatouille:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;Not everyone can become a great artist. But a great artist can come from anywhere.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that&#8217;s equally true for developers. We often see someone go from nothing to a top app in the App Store. We often see someone start without an audience and then make friends on Twitter and blogs through the quality of their writing alone. And so we welcome new voices all the time if they&#8217;re respectful.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been some debate about <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/10/13/pragmatic-pricing">Overcast 2.0&#8217;s patronage model</a>. Some of the discussion is healthy — how does a successful business model for one developer apply to other apps? — and some of the discussion is divisive. Instead of asking the right questions, it&#8217;s easy to jump straight to a <em>conclusion</em> with the dismissive statement: &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Marco, but his approach would never work for other developers&#8221;.</p>
<p>The &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Marco&#8221; attitude is poison for our community because it takes the opposite approach as that Ratatouille quote above. It implies that some developers have such an advantage that the rest of us shouldn&#8217;t even bother, because it&#8217;s not a level playing field. It&#8217;s true that some developers today have an advantage, whether through good timing or just a long history of shipping apps, but the lesson isn&#8217;t to give up; it&#8217;s to instead learn from it, and look at our own strengths. What small head start do we have that could grow into a great success tomorrow, too?</p>
<p>Rewind a handful of years, back to that day at SXSW when I could name plenty of developers who had more attention and success in our community than Marco Arment. You can be damn sure that didn&#8217;t discourage him from taking Instapaper from an &#8220;in my spare time&#8221; niche app to the top of the News section on the App Store.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never accept the implied negativity in the &#8220;that&#8217;s fine for Marco&#8221; argument. I&#8217;ll never accept that we should be <em>jealous</em> of another developer&#8217;s success instead of <em>inspired</em> by it to do our best work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disney Legend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Norman">Floyd Norman</a> has an excellent blog, usually recollecting on the early days of the Walt Disney studio, or more recent animation ventures. This week <a href="http://floydnormancom.squarespace.com/blog/2015/7/29/a-visit-from-steve-jobs">he wrote about Steve Jobs</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “An animated motion picture goes through many iterations while in production and screenings were held on a regular basis. I honestly doubt Steve was trying to curry favor with Disney. Being a shrewd negotiator Jobs didn&#8217;t need any extra help to get his way. I think he brought Apple gifts purely as a gesture of friendliness. After all, shouldn&#8217;t everybody have a Mac Laptop?”
</p></blockquote>
<p>The post includes a fantastic sketch of Steve. My only regret from WWDC this year is that I didn’t have a ticket to see Floyd speak at the conference. Although Apple doesn’t usually release the video of lunchtime sessions, I very much hope it was filmed and will show up on YouTube or Vimeo one day.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I had a great conversion with Seth Clifford one night at WWDC, about writing and blogging. We all want to get better at writing and posting more frequently. As I mentioned <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/we-need-more-bad-ideas.html">in yesterday’s post</a>, the best way to improve anything is to do more of it, more often.</p>
<p>I believe there are two important facets to microblogging. The first is the timeline experience: a reverse-chronological list of posts from your friends, like you see on Twitter. The second is that posting should be effortless: if there’s less friction between your idea and publishing it, you’ll write more often. So a big part of posting regularly is just having a system that makes it easy.</p>
<p><a href="http://sethclifford.me/2015/06/auto-posting-to-wordpress-and-archiving-in-dropbox-with-drafts/">Seth updated his iOS blogging workflow</a> by using Drafts and WordPress’s email-to-blog feature. As a nice bonus, he gets Markdown files of each post saved to Dropbox:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Drafts allows you to send email as an action. WordPress allows you to post into the system via email. Using a combination of the action and the <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/post-by-email/">Jetpack plugin’s email functionality</a>, I can go from idea to published in seconds, without touching the WP iOS app (which continues to get better, but still isn’t <em>fast</em>) and get my local copy stored away.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Also this week, Ben Brooks has switched his core Twitter posting to go through WordPress. He has a <a href="http://benb.me/">standalone microblog at benb.me</a> where the posts live. They go out to Twitter automatically via IFTTT. Posting to a blog first and then Twitter second seems like a simple idea, but it is extremely powerful. Years from now you end up with an archive of all your short-form writing at your own domain. Not as an afterthought, but as the <em>default</em>.</p>
<p>The great thing about blogging is there’s no one correct way to do this stuff. I’m really happy to see these solutions from Seth and Ben, and I know other folks are working on similar workflows.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/inside-ios-9-search-apples-plan-for-more-connected-apps/">Federico Viticci has a comprehensive write-up</a> about Apple’s approach to search in iOS 9, including comments from developers. On local app search:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “With local app search, iOS 9 can build an index of content, app features, and activities that users may want to get back to with a search query. Built like a database and already in use by Apple apps such as Mail and Reminders, CoreSpotlight will provide low level access to the index of an iOS device, making it easy to organize and retrieve content users have previously seen, created, or curated.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been slowly going through WWDC session videos, but haven’t cracked open the documentation for search yet. Sounds like an important new API for any app that has user documents.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://bitsplitting.org/2015/06/15/apple-news-and-the-open-web/">Daniel Jalkut has an optimistic take</a> on Apple News. He doesn’t think it is comparable to centralized publishing systems like Twitter or Medium for one important reason:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Because <em>the content doesn’t live on Apple’s servers</em>. This is a key distinction in my mind. Apple’s News App serves primarily not as a <em>source</em> of information, but as an amplifier of it.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>Any technology that invokes “amplifier” in a review is something I want to pay attention to. I used the same word in the closing paragraph of <a href="http://manton.org/2013/08/waiting_for_appnets.html">my pitch for App.net</a>. That service is fading away now, of course, but it’s just another reminder that even the most well-intentioned platforms are dangerous if they distract us from controlling our own content and hosting it at a custom domain.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the week I posted about WWDC to <a href="http://www.manton.org/category/micro">my microblog</a>, but I thought I&#8217;d write a longer post with the week&#8217;s narrative. It&#8217;s useful to have these to refer to in the future when all the WWDCs blur together and I&#8217;ve forgotten which event was which. Where it adds any details I&#8217;ll link to a few of the shorter posts.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s go back to Sunday morning a week ago when I arrived in San Francisco, ticketless but ready to learn and meet up with friends. What a great day. First burritos and coffee in the Mission, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2676.html">then to Oakland</a> for the NBA finals, game 2. I had signed up on the Golden State Warriors mailing list a couple weeks earlier to get in on the pre-sale tickets. Excepting the nearby San Antonio Spurs, I&#8217;m almost never going to just coincidentally be in the <em>same city</em> as an NBA finals game. I couldn&#8217;t let that chance slip by.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/wwdc_warriors.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="Golden State Warriors" border="0" /></p>
<p>And it was an amazing game. Outwardly I was rooting for the Warriors — high fives to fans when the team came back to force overtime, wearing my new yellow shirt they gave everyone at the game. But inwardly I was also marveling at LeBron&#8217;s dominance and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2678.html">happy to see the series tied up</a>. I want to see this thing go to 7 games.</p>
<p>Monday was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2680.html">the keynote</a> and later the Cartoon Art Museum / NeXT fundraiser, with beautiful art on the wall from one of my favorite films this year, Song of the Sea. Tuesday I tried to <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2688.html">catch up on some code</a> at Sightglass Coffee, watch sessions at WeWork, and installed the <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2684.html">iOS 9 beta</a> on my retina iPad Mini. In the evening on this day and others there were parties, though I only attended a few.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/wwdc_talkshow.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="The Talk Show" border="0" /></p>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/live/">The Talk Show live</a> with guest Phil Schiller was <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2690.html">a great surprise</a>. I&#8217;m so happy for John and his success. Developers who have only known Daring Fireball after it was already fairly popular may need this important reminder: John Gruber started a dozen years ago <em>with a blog that no one read</em>, just like the rest of us, and this week he conducted the best interview of a senior Apple executive I&#8217;ve ever seen. If you think it&#8217;s enough to just throw random quips to Twitter, it&#8217;s not enough. Blogging is still the best way to build an audience. (Don&#8217;t miss <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/06/11/live-with-phil">Marco&#8217;s post</a> about the event and what it means for the new Apple.)</p>
<p>I have very little to complain to Apple about this year. Maybe the keynote was a little long, but the topics they hit and the new user features and APIs were exactly right. I&#8217;ve got Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan installed and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2707.html">will require it for my next Mac app</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.manton.org/images/2015/wwdc_bridge.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="Golden State Bridge" border="0" /></p>
<p>Toward the middle of the week I wasn&#8217;t feeling particularly great — not sick, but not really upbeat enough to get excited about new APIs. I escaped the city for the afternoon on Wednesday, visiting the Walt Disney Family Museum and then walking down to Crissy Field toward the Golden Gate Bridge. I stretched my arms out wide to catch the wind and felt refreshed in a way that the stagnant weather back in Austin this time of year can&#8217;t hope to provide. I remember <a href="https://twitter.com/manton/statuses/211946809994653696">this tweet from 2012</a> and it&#8217;s always true again, year after year.</p>
<p>Thursday morning I caught <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2696.html">a session at AltConf</a> before heading to the airport. Flights were delayed out of SFO because of fog, so it was 3 hours waiting in San Francisco, and <a href="http://www.manton.org/2015/06/2700.html">another 3 hours</a> waiting in Phoenix after a missed connection. But it&#8217;s all good. WWDC was a little weird for me — not because of anything Apple did, just because I was a little wistful, and distracted by email and non-WWDC happenings too.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I&#8217;m inspired by the week. The success of both AltConf and now <a href="http://www.bringyourlayers.com/">Layers</a>, not to mention all the other smaller events and keynote watch parties, point to a very strong WWDC for years to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/06/10/how_not_to_crash_9_mindset">9th essay about avoiding crashes in your code</a>, Brent Simmons writes about learning to be even less clever:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;But over the years I’ve come to think that I should write code that’s about 10% as clever as I am. And I’ve come to believe that true cleverness is in making code so clear and obvious that it looks like nothing at all.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m in San Francisco for WWDC this week, but without a ticket again. I took some time this afternoon — miles away from the hotel and Moscone — to reflect on what I&#8217;m doing here and what I need to do next. I&#8217;ve been to WWDC many times; my first was in 1996. And it has taken almost all of those years for me to understand the truth of Brent&#8217;s statement about being clever.</p>
<p>I also believe that a programming language can either encourage or discourage clever code based on the syntax it allows. I saw it with Ruby — programmers intent on fitting as much logic into a single line of code as possible. I think I see it with Swift as well, in operator overloading and maybe even a kind of rejection of Objective-C&#8217;s notorious verbosity. We&#8217;ll know for sure if we eventually see a Swift book in the pattern of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> will be June 8-12 this year, with a lottery for ticket selection. I’m not going to put my name in the hat for a ticket; I hope to save some money and let others have a chance. I’ll be in town for a few days to meet up with folks and attend <a href="http://altconf.com">AltConf</a>, which looks excellent again.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/scholarships/">student scholarship page</a> caught my eye this year. App submissions have to be written using at least <em>some</em> Swift:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “To be considered for a WWDC 2015 Scholarship, build and submit an app that showcases your creativity and technical skills. Your Mac app or iOS app must be written in Objective-C and Swift, or written entirely in Swift.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m also starting to reset my expectations for a more full-featured, native Apple Watch SDK. I think we’ll see welcome improvements to WatchKit, but with the watch still weeks out from shipping, it seems too soon for a reimagining of the API by June.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://inessential.com/2015/02/05/uxkit_skepticism">Brent Simmons reacts to the news</a> that the upcoming Photos app for Mac uses a private UXKit framework. Instead of being the full UIKit-based replacement for AppKit that many developers want, Brent suggests it could be a minimal framework just to make some things easier:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &#8220;I could imagine a minimal UXKit that isn’t meant to replace AppKit but that can be used with both AppKit and UIKit. It might have UXColor, which would wrap UIColor and NSColor. Same with UXFont and UXImage. UXTableView could present a simplified superset of UITableView and NSTableView/NSOutlineView.&#8221;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Like Brent and many other developers, I started this same kind of compatibility work when porting Tweet Library to the Mac. I ended up abandoning the project because it&#8217;s a slippery slope to basically reinventing <a href="http://chameleonproject.org">Chameleon</a>. (Also, <a href="http://www.manton.org/2006/08/flipbook.html">back in 2006 I ported</a> parts of Microsoft&#8217;s MFC C++ framework to Cocoa and it was a <em>lot</em> of work. I&#8217;m not eager to repeat that process.)</p>
<p>I agree with Brent that we don&#8217;t necessarily need a completely new AppKit. I&#8217;d love to see Apple standardize the foundational classes which are nearly identical already — colors, images, and fonts, as Brent mentioned — as well as UI elements that <em>could</em> be the same without a real cost — views, buttons, labels, table cells, and maybe split views. These UX-prefixed classes wouldn&#8217;t do everything their UI and NS versions could do, but they&#8217;d allow developers to move more code into cross-platform layers of their app by sticking to the common properties and methods.</p>
<p>As tempting as it would be to throw in iOS-only classes like UINavigationController, I think that would be outside the scope of a minimal UXKit. Candidates should already exist in similar forms on both platforms.</p>
<p>WWDC 2015 is going to be fun if Apple attempts to tackle even a little bit of this. A minimal UXKit would strike a good compromise between the usual iterative improvements to AppKit and a more revolutionary change to the frameworks.</p>
