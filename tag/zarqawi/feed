				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I couldn&#8217;t let the 5th anniversary of September 11th pass without saying something. On Friday &#8220;the Senate intelligence committee released a report&#8221;:http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/washington/09intelcnd.html showing that there was no link between Saddam Hussein and 9/11. That isn&#8217;t news. What is news is the details: that Saddam actually <em>distrusted</em> Al Qaeda and tried to <em>capture</em> Zarqawi. The simple truth is that terrorist organizations are a threat to any government, even ones we have disagreements with.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#8217;t make you sick, here&#8217;s another one that I haven&#8217;t heard mentioned yet. Sometime next year the number of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq will <em>surpass the civilian deaths on September 11th</em>. (September 11th = 2973, Iraq as of today = 2661)</p>
<p>The level of incompetence in our President, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and their advisors reaches new heights. What can we do? Five years ago we were uneducated and scared, and even two years later we could easily be led by fear alone. Now, just stay angry. Change starts in November.</p>
